1jaker3_AAL,AAL,Still only ever trading AAL <3,"I used to live (on a very, very modest budget) just off of trades I was making on AAL during covid times, for a couple of years, but stopped at some point because it was getting harder and harder for me to be sure of what's going on with the market with it always being at all time highs...

Well, recently I have returned to enjoy the current stock market volatility.

I have been toying with \~52k (Initial deposit, then much more recently I threw another $400 or so in) that I decided to invest, and have made / realized $3700 so far in under a month, only buying / selling shares or options for AAL.

Not as good as it could have been, because I've pussied out of some positions i've taken by taking profits earlier than I had originally planned to, because I wasn't sure if it would actually go where I wanted it to, but I'm happy either way.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American’s trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA’s holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%—its worst drop since 2008. Flagship *EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while *Dragon Age: The Veilguard* missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren’t biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips—the tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren’t sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:  Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn’t hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his “America First” symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC—keen on keeping prices high—might be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn’t escape Trump’s crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel “hundreds of billions” into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? “Make it in America or pay the price.” While allies bristled, Trump’s rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump’s economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets—and world leaders—are left wondering what’s next in Trump’s unfiltered economic strategy.

While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn’t escape Trump’s crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel “hundreds of billions” into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? “Make it in America or pay the price.” While allies bristled, Trump’s rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump’s economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets—and world leaders—are left wondering what’s next in Trump’s unfiltered economic strategy.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American’s trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA’s holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%—its worst drop since 2008. Flagship *EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while *Dragon Age: The Veilguard* missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren’t biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips—the tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren’t sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:  Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn’t hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his “America First” symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC—keen on keeping prices high—might be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American’s trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA’s holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%—its worst drop since 2008. Flagship *EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while *Dragon Age: The Veilguard* missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren’t biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips—the tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren’t sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:  Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn’t hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his “America First” symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC—keen on keeping prices high—might be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn’t escape Trump’s crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel “hundreds of billions” into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? “Make it in America or pay the price.” While allies bristled, Trump’s rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump’s economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets—and world leaders—are left wondering what’s next in Trump’s unfiltered economic strategy.

I make relatively few trades after getting burned a bit in 2021, usually hold for 1-2 years and tend to hold 5-6 companies in my E*Trade.

Moved out of GILD and UAL after long runs.

Looking at AAL now, I don’t quite see why their stock is relatively depressed, compared to the other big boys (airlines) in the USA.

I see increased rev, great progress on debt, competitive market share.

Is it too much debt loading and not enough progress in a “hot market”? 

I am relatively unsophisticated in my stock picks / reviews - so any advice/commentsry- however basic, is appreciated.

Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren’t biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips—the tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren’t sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:  Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn’t hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his “America First” symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC—keen on keeping prices high—might be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn’t escape Trump’s crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel “hundreds of billions” into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? “Make it in America or pay the price.” While allies bristled, Trump’s rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump’s economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets—and world leaders—are left wondering what’s next in Trump’s unfiltered economic strategy.

1i82iee_AAL,AAL,American Airlines shares tumble as outlook falls short,"American Airlines’ first-quarter earnings outlook on Thursday fell short of analysts’ estimates, sending shares down roughly 10%.

The carrier forecast an adjusted loss per share of 20 cents to 40 cents for the first three months of 2025 based on current demand trends and fuel-price forecast, a wider loss than the 4 cents analysts were expecting, according to LSEG.

The airline said it expects unit costs, excluding fuel, to rise in the low-single digit percentage points over the first quarter of 2024 driven by lower capacity, which it expects to fall as much as 2% over last year; a higher mix of smaller, regional-jet flying; and new labor agreements it finalized last year.

The earnings outlook contrasts with sunnier forecasts from rivals United and Delta earlier this month, though American’s full-year earnings forecast of between $1.70 and $2.70, with analysts’ estimates.

American has spent much of the last year reversing a business-travel sales strategy that backfired last year. However, it also sealed a new credit card deal with its partner Citi. Compensation from its existing deals with Citi and Barclays rose 17% from 2023 to $6.1 billion last year, American said.

“As we look ahead to this year, American remains well-positioned because of the strength of our network, loyalty and co-branded credit card programs, fleet and operational reliability, and the tremendous work of our team,” CEO Robert Isom said in a news release.

Here is how American performed in the fourth quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 86 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents

Revenue: $13.66 billion vs. $13.40 billion expected

American’s fourth-quarter profit rose to $590 million from $19 million on sales that were up 4.6% on the year to $13.66 billion. Both domestic and international revenue rose, led by a surge in trans-Pacific revenue.

It has seemingly underperformed relative to its peers post-Covid. Some mishaps with their D2C strategy, cutting out agents and losing business travel. The debt levels seemingly paint the picture of a constrained balance sheet, mixed with losses rather than profits in recent times. 

However, long-term, are they likely to become irrelevant? I see some consolidation happening with Hawaii/alaska airlines. Spirit seems to be in a tough spot. Surely as one of the big four, operating in an industry that’s pretty competitive and capital intensive as a barrier to entry, it could climb back to a better position?

Do you want to see the raging water of Niagara Falls? Or everything the strip of Las Vegas has to offer? How about experiencing Miami culture? Well, unless you plan on spending weeks on the road driving to all these locations, you’ll need the airline industry to take you there.   
  
In an industry so important to the global economy I went searching to see if there was any value that could be had by investing in any of these companies. This valuation was done through comparing the largest U.S. based airlines: Delta, Southwest, United, and American. I focused my comparison on various industry specific metrics that are most relevant in driving the company's value in the future. The comp table, metric description, and analysis can be seen below.  
  
Passenger Load Factor (PLF): In essence, PLF displays a plane's capacity. Airlines have high fixed costs as every flight, they use the same amount of fuel and have a full flight crew. This metric provides insights on an Airlines capability to match consumer demand and sell flight seats when needed. Having a higher PLF is especially critical with budget airlines, but having stronger business class sales provides airlines more capacity breathing room.  
  
Passenger Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (PRASM): PRASM derives from dividing passenger revenue by revenue per mile. This provides a look into the operational efficiency of an airline as a higher PRASM generally means the company is more profitable. As an investor this matters as it shows in an ideal world. where capacity is 100%, what airline would be able to bring in the most revenue from this.  
  
Operating Profit Margin: As you can see from the chart, airlines have struggled to turn an operating profit. This can be attributed to increased costs post-Covid. I anticipate costs to ease as airlines are working towards increasing the pilot supply along with the price of oil falling over the past three months.  
  
Loyalty Revenue (FY 2022): Loyalty programs are one of the most important aspects of an airline's success and these rewards systems tend to be the big money makers. The reason for this is Airlines make money on both sides of these programs. On the consumer side, this builds customer loyalty, increasing the airline's recurring revenue. Additionally, the airline gains revenue in the advertising they provide. The growth of the loyalty programs have led to partnerships with various banks and companies that want to distribute points as a reward for using their service. Note: In United Airlines financial statement they accounted for their loyalty program differently, making it hard to track revenue made from it.  
  
My Analysis  
When viewing this compset it blows my mind that American Airlines is trading at the P/E ratio that it is. The company has the lowest P/E ratio, but the only one that turned an operating profit in Q1 2023 while also leading in PRASM and loyalty revenue. Additionally, the company is continuing to grow their international flight network with partnerships in India and Latin America. I believe American Airlines is a strong buy as they are doing all the right things that drive value while also continuing to grow their network.

I was reviewing my trades and AAL totally followed SPY on 18th but was going on it's own today (19th). Any advice. thanks !,,2022-07-19,4,8

Well here’s an update. Everything was going great, at one point my cost basis was down to $15.50 and I was up like 40%. And then the Russian bs happened. I have no idea why I didn’t sell other than outright greed. The week before I had finished doing the math and calculated that with about 50 trades, maxing out margin, and earning about $0.30 per trade with Aal, I could more or less 4-5x my money. Your can probably guess where this is heading. 

I sold everything and went all in on Aal at 16.13. I didn’t even max out my margin which pissed me off initially.. I started feeling uneasy about the trade almost immediately seeing as that Aal was struggling around 16.19. Debating whether to sell, I figured just sell the 16.50c exp in a day, surely Aal won’t drop below 16….
20 minutes later Aal is down around 15.77. Suddenly I start remembering all the comments asking what I would do if Aal dropped a dollar or two. Well, I was prepared to hold for a $2-3 drop, but surely you have to be smoking to believe Aal would drop past $15. Even if it did I could breakeven after 3 weeks. Aal bounces back to 15.97, I’m feeling confident. I go about my day. Next day it opens at 15.10, bounces to 15.55 before dropping to 14.60. I’m underwater and stressed out. Monday rolls around and it drops as low as $12.46. Triggering a margin call. 

At this point all my money is tied up in Aal. I stopped working because well, this plan was going great and I was already window shopping for a house. Soooo there I was stuck. TD Ameritrade said they would give me a week. Midway through the week I ultimately sell at 13.60. And for the first time in awhile, fear sets in, I don’t buy call options despite me thinking the market is overreacting, mostly because I’m afraid of losing even more money. Only to watch it bounce back to $16.30 two days after TD would have forced me out. 

As of April 13, the stock is at $18 and I am having a hard time dealing with this. I was right about the price, I was right about the strategy but wrong on entry by maybe 30 minutes, two more days or extra cash would have made all the difference. Margin call would have been avoided if I bought one put on spy, Aal, or maybe a gush call or something to offset but after I got filled my buying power disappeared so I rolled the dice.


And you know how the story goes, I started over trading and ended up losing far more. Currently down 80%. Fucked up part was I bought Tesla 1105c last week @18.30 each and sold early only to watch it hit $48. Did the same for 1130p @20 only to watch it hit $100:/


Last Aal trade (around March 2ish)

Entry: $16.13 shares ($0.13 credit from 16.50c)

Planned exit: $16.30

Exit: $13.60


My advice to people: when you start mentally and physically customizing cars and houses in your mind, you should stop trading options for a week.

I am expecting one final large cash infusion (insurance and gov) in about 2 months and am currently looking to go all in on Uber ($31), Lyft ($32), We ($5), upst ($65), Pypl ($100), Amzn ($2700), aap ($150), BA ($160), Nvda ($200).",2022-04-13,9,23

u2r249_AAL,AAL,AAL open interest is MASSIVE and in the money,"Hey virgins,

I’m still a bit new to the stock market, so please correct me if I’m wrong and feel free to ignore this. 

Recently, someone made a post about EVTL having a high OI that was already in the money. It shot up pretty high. Turns out that AAL is in a similar boat - OI for 18c is 30,197, and it’s ITM now. Does this mean that if AAL ends above 18 tomorrow, 3million shares get bought? I’m gonna take a chance here.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we’ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I’m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don’t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that’s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren’t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren’t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I’m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they’ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we’ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we’re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we’ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won’t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me!

ow1tr9_AAL,AAL,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTD: SKLZ, PTON, FUBO, TDOC, AAL, MU","# Last Week's Review

We hit some home-runs last week with AMD, CLF, and TLRY. All of which were up over 20% at one point. The other names are not doing too bad either and IMO still “consolidating” with their charts & technicals. Here’s a snapshot of the ticker performance from the last two weeks. In the same time-period SPY has gone up 3%.

https://preview.redd.it/2nincqfdote71.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ff5b1cf77e59cbb1c84c622c8ad5fdcebbc5de7

&#x200B;

I exited my position on CLF as I felt it was beginning to get into the “red zone” I talk about. The ticker has been on an unbelievable uptrend since the start of the year and the chart is beautiful. However, I highlighted below a short-term risk area after the stock has shot up 30% in 7 days (due to good earnings as well). It’s nearing the top of the trend channel and could potentially see a reversal. Either way, I protected my trade.

&#x200B;

Before we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.

# Chart Guidelines & Terms

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

&#x200B;

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

&#x200B;

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

&#x200B;

# The Meme List

&#x200B;

**Skillz Inc (SKLZ)**

I categorize this play on the meme stock list because SKLZ has been known to trend on various social media outlets and gain momentum through retail traders. This is a lucrative play and considered a YOLO with earnings coming up on Tuesday after the close. Looking at the chart the stock price is back to 3-month lows and where it was trading last December.

It’s current valuation at $14 is still pretty rich (5b market cap off 270m in sales), but should the stock continue to drop it might become quite favorable. This ticker traded at $45 back in February and is down 60% since.

There are many doubters in the viability of this company’s business model, but for a high-risk, high-reward play I like it at this current price. Having said that, ARK ETFs currently hold about 20 million shares of SKLZ.

&#x200B;

**Peloton (PTON)**

PTON chart looks ready for another break-out to the upside. This could be a potential “fear of lockdown” play and any news of Covid variants will cause this to pop. Glancing at the fundamentals the company has quite a strong balance sheet with very little debt, and strong growth. Most analyst’s concerns on this name are regarding if the growth is actually sustainable for the long-term.

At $118 per share the stock is nearing the bottom of the channel for it’s most recent trend over the last 3 months.

https://preview.redd.it/gur9i0weote71.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=35ffeb15132ea44c3f29d1a960e58f785f217171

&#x200B;

**FuboTV (FUBO)**

Last, but not least on the meme’s list we have FUBO. Remember the meme’s list are tickers that have the potential to gain momentum through retail traders and popularity. This can sometimes be a driving force and the truth is you need to be in on these names BEFORE the hype-train leaves the station.

FUBO had exceptionally strong performance back in December last year when it hit $60 per share. Concerns over the company’s growth and sustainability have knocked the share price down by 60% and currently sits at $26. IMO we could be entering a green zone as the stock has traded sideways for a month now. FUBO reports earnings August 10.

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

&#x200B;

**Teladoc (TDOC)**

TDOC is one of the leaders in the “tele-health” industry. It gained momentum and popularity throughout lockdowns, but as the world-reopened the stock price has tumbled. In March, Amazon also announced their entry into the tele-health services and investors did not like this increase in competition.

This is a risky play and is potentially reliant on the lockdown catalyst, but at $148 per share and a 50% haircut from it’s 52-week high, I will be looking to enter this position.

https://preview.redd.it/v3kny7ngote71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=7709c634abc65d3fd164c5082a6cb9d1d163ffb9

&#x200B;

**American Airlines (AAL)**

American airlines is a re-opening play. Travel is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and most “re-opening” stocks are still trading at a discount due to future uncertainties.

The chart for most airlines will be quite similar to each other, and in my opinion the worst is behind us. I’m looking for short-term upside on this one before the trend breaks down again.

https://preview.redd.it/8zeibk4hote71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8727e73d29eedb2c9134a3b588cb1986ea5bfd

&#x200B;

**Micron Technology (MU)**

Out of all the semi-conductor plays it always seems like MU gets no love. AMD and NVDA are performing very strong, but MU seems to be the laggard. MU is trading at a PE of 21 while NVDA and AMD trade at 92 and 37, respectively.

MU just posted very solid earnings and the macro environment should be a strong driver of growth for semi-conductors in general. There has been a chip-shortage for some time now affecting many industries and all this pent up demand will last into 2022.

I thought this stock was going to continue it’s breakout at $95 a share, but it broke down starting in April and may have found a bottom at $77. I like MU here and might enter a position.

https://preview.redd.it/bya2xywhote71.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f3b1453ae52c152d07f5a0de245e5d4227142f

&#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts**

That’s the end for this week. Remember, investing is about PAYtience because it pays to be patient. There are A LOT of uncertainties in this market right now which means it is not the time for crazy YOLOs. We have risks from inflation, covid, rates & QE tapering, re-opening risk (or lack of going back to “normal”).

The VIX might not be close to the highs, but volatility is STILL HERE. We are seeing 2-5% daily swings in a lot of stocks right now. If anyone remembers before the pandemic you would be lucky to see a 2% move in most names.

Hope you all had a great weekend and I’ll be back next week. Just FYI I might start adding a mid-week update some of the weeks to spot existing up-trends, down-trends, or tickers hyped on social media.",2021-08-01,27,6

ojpc58_AAL,AAL,American Airlines is free money,"So After being in a downtrend since march and having 7 red weekly candles in a row as we approach earnings. Today, after hours they just posted a report saying ""The Company expects its second quarter total revenue to be down approximately 37.5% versus the second quarter of 2019."" In Q2-2019 the revenue was ~12B. So that means the Revenue for Q2 is about 7.4B$ So they've beat the forecast expectation wich was ~7B. I find it extremely weird  that they pre-announce this crucial information 9 days before the actual earning. Any reason why? That's like pretty much a guaranteed pump for ER Right?

Sounds fucking awesome right.  

The issuance was oversubscribed by $35 Billion no less.

But while that is nice and all, the devil is in the details.

The company still burns 30 million dollars a day paying people to do work that isn’t making the company money.

The leveraged away their customer loyalty programs to secure the deal.  Meaning while the massive debt they just paid away looks great, the point being is that their company will see less in profits for the entire time the debt stays on the books.

Travel may be in a slight upswing, but here is food for thought, what if kids and teachers are working over the summer to get caught up in academics and people travel much less than anticipated?  That’s a realistic situation facing this country because otherwise an entire generation of children is being left behind.

Also I’m not convinced people are going to jump out and travel, I think a lot of people will be reluctant to and start by seeing friends and relatives locally before actually taking on more adventurous steps.

Business travel, the most lucrative kind of travel, has basically be scrapped by all major corporations unless it’s completely necessary.

There still aren’t going to be conferences where professionals travel to this year.  It isn’t going to happen.  

This is a classic buy the rumor, sell the news event because the stock itself has issued more shares in the last year to dilute and already terrible and diluted earnings.

You can hope to see a recovery, but until that day actually comes, this stock has the ability to really fuck people that are long on hope.

With the stimulus bill signed today, there isn’t much good news left in the market to be priced in.

Oil prices are on a steady increase towards $100 a barrel, and the airline industry which was horribly strapped for cash and could not estimate fuel demand last year underhedged their exposure.  Even if travel comes back, I hate to break it to you, it won’t be the airline companies making money, it’s going to be the oil industry.

&#x200B;

**SCENARIO:**

Ever since DFV has shown us the glory of short squeezes, there's been an army of idiots attempting to short squeeze any stock with above average short %. This week if you haven't noticed your account is down 50% because there was a ""sEctOr rOtaTion"" into airlines, travel, casinos, hotels. The argument being vaccinestalksgoingwell.exe and reopening have more growth potential than tech (yada yada yield -- BRRRR goes the printer -- tech all day). So the idiots on stock twits, discovered that American Airlines ($AAL) has a >25% short interest and is trading ""below"" pre-pandemic levels. My DD is to prove to you the following i) AAL management team has issued 50% more shares and diluted the tits out of the company therefore the price/valuation are not understood, ii) There is an incoming stock issuance, iii) $19 puts are only $0.31

Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders. **The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating a company’s market capitalization.** You can see from this graph below -- $AAL has diluted their company by nearly 50% to survive the pandemic.

[American Airline's LTM Outstanding Shares](https://preview.redd.it/bojg1iypddj61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4984a79b531221dd605996b414e7d722c7a7f09)

This however does not tell the whole story. The company in April took at $6B loan from the treasury. Apart of the agreement, the treasury has the ability to exercise 44M warrants at a strike price of $12.51 cents. This represents 7.8% of the outstanding shares in $AAL.

&#x200B;

Don't believe me? Let's have a look at their market cap. Assuming you're a complete imbecile and only look at stock price, sure it looks like $AAL is trading far below pre-pandemic levels. As of close today (2/23/21) $AAL had a market cap of $13.22B. In November of 2019, they had a market cap $13.64B --- except the stock was trading at $30.56. RUH ROH.....

**SHARE ISSUANCE:**

In case you thought they've diluted enough of their failing airline company, just last month (1/29/21) $AAL reached a deal with Goldman and Citi to issue $1.1B MORE IN ADDITIONAL SHARES. Here's my favorite part... the company has decided not to announce when the shares would be issued and barred their executives from speaking to the media. In other words, they have been waiting for retail investors to drive the stock price higher to dump these shares into the market. This $1.1B is as of today 8% of their market cap -- JUICY

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Bulls are under the assumption that $AAL can be short squeezed and that it's trading far below pre-pandemic levels when the company has been diluted more than your wife's boyfriend's fleshlight and this fake sector rotation is coming to a quick and bloody end.

j3eduj_AAL,AAL,Reviewing my September adventure with AAL.,"I thought it would be interesting to look at my option positions in AAL during September and a portion of August, and how they worked for me.

### Disclaimers About Portfolio

These positions represent a portion of my cash position in my portfolio, which represents a portion of my portfolio itself. I use options as a source of investing cash, primarily. The remainder of my portfolio (which is admittedly much smaller than many) is investing in a 90/10 blend of stock/bonds. The bonds are US corporate high-yield bond ETFs.

The stock in my portfolio is about 15% SPY directly, 30% large cap ETF, 20% mid cap ETF, 15% small cap ETF, 10% International ETF, and 10% high dividend ETF.

I'm also not any kind of professional. This is my own money, I don't work in any industry related to markets, and this is a retrospective of my own thoughts, not advice for other people to follow.

### Using A Wheel Strategy

I had two wheel strategies I engaged in during September. They were on American Airlines (AAL) and Bank of America (BAC). Today I'll be going over my AAL position, and my thoughts during this whole process.

Both of these are stocks that I believe are undervalued on a 2-5 year time-scale, and thus are stocks that I am interested in holding long term.

I started with a CSP on AAL with a strike of $13 in August for a premium of $0.47. $13 was the price I was willing to buy the stock at anyway, which is how I determined my strike. There are many different opinions on how to operate a wheel strategy, but I do not determine my strike price by premium and instead use my evaluation of the underlying.

In this case, airlines in general have suffered and will continue to suffer in the short term due to the pandemic, particularly US airlines. However, there is no situation that I envision where the entire airline industry in the US collapses, thus there will be some mixture of failures and mergers that lead to market consolidation, or there will be a long recovery in the industry while it is propped up by government assistance.

Given this analysis as a starting point, there should be an opportunity to choose the airline stock that you believe to be best positioned to come out of the current market environment. The one that I actually feel is best positioned isn't AAL, but Alaska Airlines (ALK). However, I was not interested in tying up that level of capital in a CSP to open a position on this one sector, so for diversification reasons I eliminated ALK as an option. 

Of the ones that were left, I decided that AAL seemed the best positioned for long-term growth from its current position. AAL closed on August 20, expiration day, at $12.16, leaving me with +100 AAL and a cost basis of $12.53 per share.

The very next Monday the stock spiked to $13.44, which allowed me to sell my covered call at a strike of $14 for a premium of $0.92. This dropped my cost basis to $11.61 per share. In a wheel strategy, I base my call strike annualized yield. If I had lost on the September 18th call, I would have sold for an annualized return on my cash position of nearly 35%. Despite the volatility of this industry, and the risk that a big government announcement could spike the price, I'm not chasing lottery tickets with this position, I looking for a high annual return on my cash position. I'd be thrilled to return 35% of my cash for the whole year, so I was unconcerned with selling a call so close to the current price.

For reference, at the time that I sold the call, the ITM% was very close to 50%.

I decided late in the option cycle to expand my position in AAL, and sold another CSP at a strike of $12.5 for $0.13. This is something I would have done differently, I think. I sold this position on September 13th, five days before expiry. There simply was not enough theta left to justify the position, but I was confident (too confident) at that point that AAL would close on the 18th between $12.50 and $14.00.

I was right, it turns out, but it was still a trade I would do differently looking back. AAL closed September 18th at $13.19. That wasn't entirely relevant however, because I closed both position on September 15th. I closed the call position for $0.25 for a net premium of $0.68, and the CSP for $0.04 for a net premium of $0.09.

The motivation in doing so, at the time, was not actually because of assignment risk. I was perfectly fine being assigned, as I've described. The reason that I closed the positions was to free equity for opening positions for the October expiries, which had some very appealing yields.

On September 15th, that same day, I opened a new call position for the OCT 16 $15 strike with a premium of $0.87. This, again, would represent a return of more than 30% on my cash if closed.

On September 16th I opened a new CSP position. It was the OCT 16 $13 strike with a premium of  $0.94.

Both of these positions are open right now.

The put position was not sold at the ideal time to collect the most premium for that strike, but again, I chose the strike based on the price that I wanted to get into the stock at, not based on the options themselves.

The put is almost surely going to be assigned, however I'm actually rather pleased that this is the case. I don't think AAL is going to spend significant time below $11.50 over the next few months, and the cost basis of the shares I'll be holding will make it very easy for me to liquidate back to cash if I need to.

The biggest risk, since this is a ""cash position"" as far as my portfolio is concerned, is that AAL drops down below $12 at a very inconvenient time when I need that cash for something else. However, I had reduced the cost basis of the stock I own and will own enough that I view this as an acceptable risk for the potential and/or expected return.

The ""breakeven"" price for my current shares in AAL is $10.99. The breakeven price for the shares I expect to be assigned in October will be $12.06. This will make the cost basis of my entire AAL position $11.525 on October 16th, which is very near what I've determined to be the ""floor"".

Once I roll that position into a covered call for November, I expect to be in a position where I can liquidate at a profit at nearly any point. The main risk in this position is, again, a total cratering of AAL stock. This risk is, in my opinion, backstopped by the reality that I don't expect the US government would actually allow the bankruptcy of American Airlines or the commercial airline industry.

Overall, I'm happy with how this position has worked out. I still believe that AAL will be a good stock to hold longer term, but I'm treating it as a cash position that I'm willing to liquidate at any time. I am considering transitioning this to a pure stock position in November, and my personal expectation gets more bullish in 2021 for AAL, and there might be more upside to simply holding.",2020-10-01,3,0

Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.

# Bullish Alerts

**$BABA**   \- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).

**$CHWY**   \- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

**$TWLO**   \- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**   \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**   \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

I developed a few tools last month and I have been testing their results by posting alerts in different groups. The tool here uses data analysis on top of options flow to make short term predictions (1-5) days about stocks. This can be really useful for day traders, hence this post here. There is no promotion, so don't worry. 

We've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

**$COST** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This might do a small pull back first. Get in on that ([https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png)). Getting in right away wouldn't be a great setup.

**$AAPL**  \- Bullish probability of 72.78%. Bullish triangle formed on 1 hour  chart. Careful with this setup if it drops because there is a gap.  Otherwise, this might run more upwards ([https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png](https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png)).

There is no promotion, so don't worry. 

We've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$NFLX**  \- Bullish probability of 86.99%. This seems a really great setup for a  good bullish run. Recently touched the moving averages and staying above  them now ([https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png](https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png)). Expecting this to go up.

**$COST** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This might do a small pull back first. Get in on that ([https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png)). Getting in right away wouldn't be a great setup.

**$AAPL**  \- Bullish probability of 72.78%. Bullish triangle formed on 1 hour  chart. Careful with this setup if it drops because there is a gap.  Otherwise, this might run more upwards ([https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png](https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png)).

**$FSLY**  \- Bullish probability of 70.68%. I know this dropped hard today but  this stock respects the moving averages a lot. Get in on a dip,  preferably on the $102 level ([https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png](https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$FCX** \- Bearish probability of 91.97%. This is only a good setup if it falls down and crosses the support level at $13.6 ([https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png](https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png))

**$XOM** \- Bearish probability of 91.96%. This seems like a good setup, especially if it can stay below the $44.3 level ([https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png](https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 91.67%. **Very very risky setup**.  After the news today, I would be careful. However, airlines have a  habit of going down after rallying for a day. The $13 level is very  important resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png](https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png))

**$WLL** \- Bearish probability of 91.10%. Good setup if it breaks the $1.05 resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png](https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png)

i3cwt7_AAL,AAL,"AAL full flights=stonks go up, right?","I've been lurking this sub for a year now waiting for my chance to finally pull the trigger. 

I have been on 20 flights since May on all major airlines including Spirit. I have seen the traffic slowly creep back up and flights fill up to full capacities. Over the past 3 weeks I have been on 3 American and 1 United flights and I can say that AAL is packing these bitches full. All 3 American...full flights. All first class seats had been purchased and even standby lists starting to develop. I was even offered vouchers this last weekend flying from ORD-IAH.

Another reason why I am thinking of going heavy AAL is their main partner is British Airways. Europe is mostly shut down other than Croatia, Turkey, and the UK. The UK has a 2 week ""mandatory quarantine"" which seems to be going away soon. The UK is going to be one of the first accessible European locations back open with AAL in the best position to capitalize the quickest. 

United and Delta have already increased their flights in September by 30% with most of those going to the UK, Amsterdam and Paris. 

American has almost perfected the basic economy by a major airline and is leaps and bounds above shitty United. 

I am fully expecting the flights and capacity to drastically increase over the next month and into the 4th quarter.

homhp2_AAL,AAL,Opinion: is AAL poised for a 1-day quick jump?,"AAL has been falling down for 5 days straight...by no means I think it is a healthy long-term investment. But, I am willing to bet that after 5-6 days of downward trend and reaching support levels, that it will at least burst up for a day.

This is about one trade, one transaction. Not ongoing. Just today. I don't care if you are into day trading or if you're not into day trading. I don't care if you like airlines stocks or you love Buffet.

This is a simple opinion. Will AAL stock have a significant spike and end in the green today?

Tomorrow it can tank. But, I am asking today. **Just interested to compare my opinion with others.**

According to moving averages, RSI, and some support levels....it seems like it could.

I anticipate a pump from the news, because capitalism. This should drive down the price of puts.

I’m going to give it this week, but looking for good entry points. 

Wanted to share my decision with you all, open to hearing alternative perspectives.

EDIT: Everyone saying “how’d that go” is illiterate. I said in my post, I expect AAL to go up short term on the news (which it is) and that it will drive put prices down for a quality entry point (which I’m still looking for) So I haven’t lost money on this...    yet ;) I will probably get my position toward the end of this week.",2020-06-29,284,185
hgjzo6_UAL,UAL,Does recent PR indicate airlines are drowning? I think yes (UAL and AAL in particular),"Airlines have already been devastated but lately amidst the worsening rout, we have seen these bizarre PR headlines that seem focused on driving up the stock price without grounding in reality. 

Today we see UAL is resuming flights to China. Wow. Woot. Except only Chinese citizens can return to China. So WTF is the revenue coming from and are these flights actually just going to be burning more money being in the air mostly empty? (the answer is yes)

Next we have AAL. ""We are allowing people to sit in the middle seat again"". So in the midst of the pandemic re-worsening in the US, you are telling me enough people are flying AAL to where they A) actually have to re-open their seats and B) are willing to sit shoulder to shoulder if that is the case, packed like sardines in coach, when destinations are once again implementing travel restrictions (not to mention international travel is impossible almost anywhere), and when unemployment / disposable income are about to be at their highest and lowest respective levels in a loooooong time? And it isn't like there are any conventions or business travel happening anymore....

My point is these headlines are fluff designed to distract from their massive debt offerings and prospective dilutions of shareholders. Q2 results are impending and are going to be.... so very bad. Early indications are that Q3 really may not be much better (OK, 10-20% above worst-ever levels is an improvement but if you are still bleeding 40-50M a day....). 

These last-ditch PR blitzes are designed to bolster the debt offerings but IMO both UAL and AAL are ultimately going to be bailed out by the govt and shareholder equity is going to be wiped out entirely, this may actually become evident in the share price of both airlines as early as August or September (remember, markets are forward looking).",2020-06-27,5,9

h8bpb3_AAL,AAL,"Why ""smart"" money is using media to discourage AAL holding","Currently AAL has 422,894,500 shares in the float. 87% is owned by institutions or insiders.  That's 367,918,215 shares leaving 57,976,285 shares to trade. Last short interest report from June 9th showed 126,980,000 shorted shares..... That's 72,003,715 to many... There is currently 644,263 Robin hood traders who own shares. If each of them owned 86 shares they would own the remainder of the float.. That's just Robinhood, this doesn't include all other trading platforms. I haven't looked but I'm sure that other airlines are similar.

If they were smart they were covering on the last drop. All pigs left short in airlines will continue to get squeezed.

Don't get me wrong the fundamentals of airlines is not looking good. Stocks don't care though because you have to have someone buy and sell and right now nobody is selling just people shorting and covering themselves.

No current position but I will open Calls Monday, date and strike pending on Monday price action.

If you haven't noticed the whole stock market is like this right now. Fundamentals are crap and everyone is shorting everything. Until a big position dumps their shares this will continue. New traders are either Yolo options players or they are Chad and Karen who just opens an account and buys the newest trend moving up and has no intention of selling anytime soon because they ""bought the dip..."" So unless Blackrock or Vanguard dump their portfolios ""smart"" money is going to keep squeezing themselves trying to pick the top.

Not much theta capture due to the extremely long duration, really a directional play.  The question being asked of course is, ""will AAL survive""?  If it does, this is an insane amount of premium capture per unit reduction in buying power.

Also interesting note: Delta for that strike (-0.16) is much different than predicted prob ITM (75%).  I'm used to seeing prob ITM nearly match delta (as we discuss used a proxy).  I usually don't look at such long expirations so perhaps that is what is driving the low delta vs. prob ITM.",2020-06-04,2,7

American Airlines: Overstated Bankruptcy Fears

May 25, 2020 9:25 AM ETAmerican Airlines Group Inc. (AAL)14 Comments7 Likes

Summary

American Airlines is far closer to cash flow positive despite limited domestic air travel.

The market still isn't correctly factoring in the $4.1 billion PSP grant into daily cash burn rates.

The airline could approach daily cash flow breakeven at 30% capacity levels of 2019.

The stock is a buy below $10 as the airline faces limited bankruptcy risk.

Never has a stock had so many bankruptcy questions while trading near $10 per share. Yet, American Airlines Group (AAL) finds the stock in just that situation. At the depths of the virus panic and when financial aid was questionable, some bankruptcy fears were logical. But now, the more logical outcome is a return to a very profitable airline on the verge of substantial free cash flow generation. My previous research that America Airlines has plenty of breathing room is only reinforced by the resurgent passenger demand heading into the Memorial Day weekend.

Traffic Surge

The easiest path to the airline sector avoiding a bankruptcy is for traffic to return to more normal levels. When the Boeing (BA) CEO made the airline bankruptcy comment on May 12, the industry traffic was more in line with this chart from CNBC showing daily passenger levels still scrapping off the bottom down over 90% from 2019 levels.
￼Source: CNBC
On May 12, only 163K passengers went through the TSA checkpoint. On May 22, nearly 350K passengers flew on U.S. airlines. In the course of 10 days, the U.S. capacity grew from 7.5% to 12.5% of 2019 levels. The sudden launch in traffic dramatically alters the view of whether airlines end up filing bankruptcy.
When looking at the rebound in a closer view of the drop, the passenger counts are making a U-shape rebound. Again, these aren't the types of traffic rebounds suggestive of bankruptcies in the airline sector.
In the next few weeks, both Las Vegas and Florida theme parks in Orlando will reopen. The flying public will now have substantially more reasons to actually fly, breaking the mindset that people weren't flying due to fears when the issue is the lack of destinations without travel restrictions. For now, Hawaii still has a 14-day quarantine requirement until at least June 30 for people flying to the islands which naturally restricts any tourists.
China air traffic is already above 40% of pre-virus levels. Even Delta Air Lines (DAL) recently targeted a return to 50% of previous traffic levels by the end of September. The market initially ran blindly negative with the airline planning to furlough half of its pilots, but the news was actually a positive indication Delta plans to maintain the other half of its pilots due to a forecasted resurgence in demand.

Path To Breakeven

As highlighted in numerous of my articles about the airlines, the path to cash flow breakeven isn't as far away as the market thinks. The sector isn't correctly factoring in the PSP grant from the U.S. Treasury, causing an irrational view of daily cash flow burn rates. Not to mention, some of the initial cash burn numbers, including those from American Airlines, were highly inflated by refunds in the short term.

My last article provided some key figures for investors to absorb. The airline predicted ending June with a daily cash burn rate of $50 million. The number factors in booking finally catching refunds and didn't factor in the daily PSP grant of $22.5 million to cover some payroll costs. American Airlines obtained a $4.1 billion grant to cover the 183 days from April 1 to September 30.
The actual daily cash burn from operations was only forecasted in the $27.5 million range. The $50.0 million is more of a liquidity burn rate with the PSP included in the liquidity amount. The airline will eliminate those related payroll costs after September 30 assuming traffic hasn't returned to normal levels.
This amount most notably included no benefit from an improving revenue trend. Crucially, America Airlines provided this forecast back on April 30 along with the Q1 earnings call where CEO Doug Parker made the following statement regarding the revenue portion of the daily cash burn:

As a result of all that, we expect to end this quarter with approximately $11 billion of liquidity and a significant amount of unencumbered assets still in place. That forecast assumes little to no increase in demand for air travel throughout the quarter.

At the time, daily domestic passengers were only back to 120K or barely 5% of 2019 capacity levels. With reduced fares, the 5% capacity along with loyalty fees and cargo revenues likely generated between 5% and 10% of 2019 revenues.
Since April 29, traffic has already been documented as reaching 12.5% of 2019 levels. In essence, traffic levels are up 150% since American Airlines provided the daily cash burn levels which included limited expectations for increased demand.
A return to 30% of 2019 traffic levels when combined with loyalty fees and cargo revenues, American Airlines should reach at least 30% of Q2'19 revenues of $12 billion. In such a case, the airline would generate ~$40 million in revenues per day ($3.6 billion for the quarter) or somewhere around $27 million per day above the revenues from when the airline reported numbers at the end of April.
The only big question is variable costs from increasing capacity from 20% of 2019 levels to 30%. What we do know is that revenues are large enough to wipe out the cash burn and variable costs such as payroll aren't increasing because the PSP required the airlines to keep those costs elevated.
The big variable is fuel which cost the airline $2.5 billion last Q2. Additional costs such as maintenance, landing fees and selling expenses were another $1.5 billion. The $2.6 billion in other expenses are generally variable as well.

The big key here is that fuel costs are down 50% so a normalized view of those expenses are $1.25 billion. Combined with these other variable expenses, American Airlines has $5.3 billion of quarterly expenses that dip to $1.06 billion with capacity at 20% and $1.59 billion up at 30%. The $530 million in additional costs is only $5.9 million per day in June.
Revenue growth eliminates all but these additional costs from the daily cash burn rate. With these low fuel costs, capacity at 40% would actually lead to positive cash flows. The big wild card is that at 50% capacity and with jet fuel over 50% below last year's costs per gallon, American Airlines saves over $2 billion on fuel coast per quarter.
In the end, American Airlines gets really close to cash flow breakeven around 30% of previous capacity levels as long as jet fuel costs remain below half of 2019 prices above $2/gallon. The real key to investors is that the airline reduces cash burn dramatically at these capacity levels and a shareholder can sit back and relax that bankruptcy fears will completely disappear. With bankruptcy off the table, shareholders can fully participate in the eventual rebound to record travel demand that always occurs after previous virus and terrorist fears pass.

Takeaway

The key investor takeaway is that American Airlines gets rather close to operating cash flow breakeven at 30% capacity. With bookings up, the airline might actually turn the daily cash rate to positive levels by the end of June. In addition, higher capacity rates will help cut the losses by July and August.
Even without considering far better cash flow metrics due to surging travel demand, American Airlines forecasted ending June with $11 billion in liquidity. The stock has very low risk of bankruptcy here with the only possible negative outcome coming from another virus related travel shutdown. The stock is a buy here below $10.",2020-05-25,65,50

ge21dy_AAL,AAL,[AAL] American Airlines' risk of bankruptcy.,"So I bought a handful of AAL stocks in this recent low because it's pretty close to all time low. Also it's less than fifth of the price of all time high. All relevant news headlines are negative which I assume is making this stock tank even more making this a potentially really profitable investment in the long term when things ease down.

Obviously the risk is bankruptcy. Compared to Southwest or Delta their fundamentals are pretty shit. High debt burden, low profit margins. They're burning over 50 million in cash a day.

They got the biggest loan and a grant from the government in the recent aid. And they're the biggest airline with over 100k employees (also with America in their name lol) which makes me think the fed will help them if shits hits the fan and they become really close to bankruptcy. I know they declared bankruptcy before but I believe this time government intervention is more likely due to the damage being caused by the corona.

I've also been considering selling my current stakes in them and just buying Southwest or Delta which seem to have much better financials and fundamentals to survive this crisis, but potentially less % gains post recovery.

fdwt08_AAL,AAL,American Airlines (AAL) - Grounded?,"With the Coronavirus in full tilt and no end in sight, airline stocks continue to get hammered. 

Losses from canceled flights and lack of demand stacking up, but history shows that the turning point comes once the spread stops. 

Typical 3 months after the spread of a virus stops stocks of airline companies regain a large portion of their losses. Not sure if now is the time to buy, yet has to be on the bubble of possible buys.

I notice that their financials seems to be very bad(If I don't watch it wrong), currently have around:

60 Bn total liabilities

3.9 Bn cash on hands.

Their revenue for 2019 is around 45 Bn but their expenses are already 42 Bn and net income is only 1.6 Bn.

Since the virus have made many Asian flights got canceled so if the virus did spread to US which is highly likely, I assume that many people (maybe 30-50%) would just stop flying for travel, ask for refunds and stay at home.

So do you guys think that AAL is a good put play since their debts looks crazy and they could run out of cash soon?",2020-02-28,2,0

fahvp3_AAL,AAL,Aggressive/Unusual Options - AAL/CCL/GILD/MSFT,"Today   I included the aggressive  orders that I see, many of them instead of    just a few into one picture.  Today I didn't color code the calls/puts     but did color code the  companies.

These   options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order  to get filled faster.

Also   all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest  in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either   buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the   aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of    these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.

Data is here -[https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W](https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W)

The GILD calls seem out of the ordinary with HUGE strikes for the future.  For puts, watch CCL/AAL/V/UBER. CCL and Uber from the virus fears.

I  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data       alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options    data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use       protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in    and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly    expiry's, consider a longer expiry.

AAL also has fallen more, so it has more upside, I think.  Advantage AAL.  (Seems like DAL is almost to 52 week high and whether it can go more remains to be seen)

However, DAL has less debt.  Advantage DAL.

DAL also has better dividends, so if the market goes sideways, DAL will be better.  Advantage DAL.

AAL seems to be more domestic, while DAL seems to have more international flights.  I think this is neither here nor there.

Quick summary of what I found:

* FX effects accounted for 2.13% revenue hit (which results in a 6.9% hit to earnings) in FY2014, and an estimated 1.57% revenue hit (which results in a 5% hit to earnings) in FY2015.

* Year-over-Year fuel savings from FY2014 to FY2015 account for a $2.344 billion boost to FY2015 earnings.

* FY2015E EPS of $9.24 - slightly lower than the average analyst estimate.

I have two questions for you all here in /r/Stocks:

* Where do you think I went wrong or could improve the model?

* Can any of you come to a YoY fuel savings of $4 Billion like [this analyst at Imperial Capital predicts](http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/15/06/5582765/imperial-capital-cuts-american-airlines-estimates-but-ma)?  I was only able to arrive at $2.344 Billion.",2015-06-11,8,16

2z8pn4_COP,COP,Offsetting American Airlines' (AAL) FX losses with lower fuel prices,"Edit:  Thanks to /u/rambosis for pointing out that I forgot to average the changes in both FX and fuel.  I have updated the numbers to reflect this.

As American Airlines does not hedge fuel prices, it is one of the primary beneficiaries of today's record low fuel costs.  However, American Airlines also has significant FX exposure to the strong dollar.  I wanted to see if this FX headwind can blow stronger than the lower fuel price tailwind for the stock.  Here's what I found:

In [American Airlines' latest news release](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&p=irol-newsArticle&id=2010763), the CEO described how ""Total revenue in the fourth quarter was a record $10.2 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent versus the fourth quarter 2013 on a combined bases and excluding special times...""  I used this 2.1% multiplier to roughly estimate this quarter's revenue based off of this quarter last year.  [I arrived at a rough figure of $10.21 billion](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aal/financials/income/quarter).

Next, I looked at the strength of the USD versus the currencies of various foreign countries in which American Airlines flies.

* The [USD index has risen 6.25% over the last 3 months](https://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX%3AUSDOLLAR&ei=xOkGVeK2DeHwsQf-k4CwDQ) half of this is 3.125%.

*[USD / EUR](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdeur&ei=9_YGVenUEO-Nsgehq4HYCA) has risen 18.5% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 9.25%.

*[USD / GBP](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdgbp&ei=HfcGVemJKeqysAeX9YHYDA) has risen 6% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 3%.

*[USD / BRL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdbrl&ei=R_cGVdiMDqPrsQeR3oHICg) has risen 21% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 10.5%.

*[USD / COP](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdcop&ei=b_cGVYn_NoP6sgfTtYHwCA) has risen 9% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 4.5%

Using [American Airlines' ""Where We Fly"" website](http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/whereWeFly/maps/world.jsp?anchorEvent=false&from=Nav) I was able to estimate that roughly 20% of all their flights go to Europe (of which 25% are to Great Britain) and 10% of all flights are to South America.

Using the $10.21 billion revenue estimate (which I understand is extremely rough), I estimated the following:

*$511 million in revenue is exposed to the GBP

*$1.53 billion in revenue is exposed to the EUR

*$1.02 billion in revenue is exposed to South American currencies


Using those figures, I assumed the worst (that American Airlines does not change fares in these regions and takes the full brunt of the FX hit).  This meant that AAL may lose up to $15.33 million in GBP, up to $142 million in EUR, and up to $102 million in South American currencies (I used a discount of 20% for all of South America), **totaling an FX loss of $259 million this quarter alone.**  That is significantly more than the [$30 million](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&p=irol-newsArticle&id=2010763) they reported last quarter.

As for fuel prices, I again used the 2% multiplier.  Total fuel costs last quarter were [$2.659 billion](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&p=irol-newsArticle&id=2010763).  This brings my estimate to $2.712 billion this quarter without taking into account the decline in fuel prices since December 31st.  That decline is [21 percent](http://www.cmegroup.com/apps/cmegroup/widgets/productLibs/esignal-charts.html?code=CL&title=APR_2015_Crude_Oil_&type=p&venue=1&monthYear=J5&year=2015&exchangeCode=XNYM), from $54.71 to $43.15.  Assuming the fuel was purchased at an average price of $48.93, a decline of 10.6%,  **this suggests a fuel savings this quarter of $287 million for this quarter from last quarter.**

All in all, the net savings for AAL is **roughly $28 million for this quarter from last quarter**, significantly less than I was expecting given the precipitous decline in fuel prices.  

What do you guys think?  What should I have done differently?

2rs5hc_AAL,AAL,Question about AAL PE Ratio,"Hey everyone, I'm trying to learn more about investing and I decided to look into the airline industry over the past few weeks. I was just looking at American Airlines Group (AAL) and for some reason every website I've checked is reporting totally different PE ratios for the company:

(Links at the bottom)
Yahoo Finance: 104.72

Google Finance: --

Nasdaq website: 4.59

Bloomberg: 8.2

Other airlines like DAL don't have such a wide spread of PE's so I feell like I'm doing something wrong. Could anyone tell me how I can find the actual PE ratio? I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation from AAL's SEC filings and found a number around 16 for their PE ratio so I'm totally lost here.

1zdz1r_GM,GM,American Airlines vs. GM question.,"A quick question for all the brilliant stock-watchers out there:  what are the differences in the GM bankruptcy v that of AA from a stock perspective?  I'll give a little background (mind you my knowledge of this sort of thing is very rudimentary). 

Years ago, I bought GM when it was in the shitter and it had an impending bailout. I didn't buy a lot, but did so under the logic that it's an American company too big and important to fail. Upon bankruptcy, I lost all of the shares I had purchased, and did not gain any when GM was relisted under its new ticker symbol. 

I pretty much did the exact same thing with AAL last year. Only, when it was relisted under its new ticker symbol, I was granted shares totaling (in dollars) what I had prior to AA bankruptcy. It's now worth something like 560% what I paid for it. 

Why did I lose my money in one situation (GM), but have my balance transferred at a discount stock price in the other (AA)?  Any insight would be helpful so I can make more educated decisions in the future. Thanks.",2014-03-03,6,2
