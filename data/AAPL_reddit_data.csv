1kym4ye_AAPL,AAPL,Never been this worried about my Apple holding,"I've a very significant holding in Apple, and this grew over the last 15 years. But, this is the first time I'm really starting to worry about them. Was there ever a period in the past where this company had nothing to look for in terms of products? Yes, Apple Car didn't materialize, Vision Pro didn't pan out well either. I don't see anything enthusiastic coming out of Apple in the next few years, other than slimmer iPhones, and such incremental updates. 

Anyone else feeling that they are losing the plot here?",2025-05-29,0,55

1kw53bv_AAPL,AAPL,Apple Stock Is On An 8-Day Losing Streak As Trump Trade Fracas Intensifies—Watch These Levels,"No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-apple-stock-levels-8-day-losing-streak-trump-trade-iphones-11740736](https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-apple-stock-levels-8-day-losing-streak-trump-trade-iphones-11740736)

**Key Takeaways**

Apple shares fell sharply to close out last week after President Trump threatened to impose hefty tariffs on the company if it doesn't manufacture iPhones in the U.S.

The stock has closed lower for eight consecutive sessions and has lost 22% of its value since the start of the year, lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers.

The price recently ran into selling pressure near the upper trendline of a descending broadening formation and the 50-day moving average.

Investors should watch major support levels on Apple's chart around $193 and $169, while also monitoring crucial resistance levels near $215 and $237.

Apple (AAPL) shares will be in the spotlight at the start of the holiday-shortened trading week after falling sharply Friday when President Donald Trump threatened to impose hefty tariffs on the company if it doesn't manufacture iPhones in the U.S.

In a Friday-morning post on Truth Social, Trump said he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones sold in the US must be built in the U.S. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president said.

Trump’s comments were his latest push to ensure that Apple doesn’t expand iPhone production in India as it shifts away from manufacturing in China, which faces among the highest import tariffs of U.S. trading partners. Apple's imports into the U.S. have so far escaped being hit since the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers and some other consumer electronic devices from ""reciprocal"" tariffs imposed in early April. 

Apple shares dropped 3% on Friday to around $195, losing ground for the eighth consecutive session. The stock has lost 22% of its value since the start of 2025, significantly lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers, as sentiment toward the company has soured due to its significant exposure to tariffs

Below, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and use technical analysis identify major price levels worth watching out for.

**Descending Broadening Formation in Play**

Since setting their record high in late December, Apple shares have trended lower within a descending broadening formation, with the price tagging the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time.

More recently, the stock ran into selling pressure near the pattern’s upper trendline and 50-day moving average, which has coincided with the relative strength index falling below its neutral threshold to signal weakening price momentum.

It’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA in early April to form a ""death cross,"" a chart signal that indicates further declines.

Let’s point out major support and resistance levels on Apple’s chart that investors will likely be watching.

**Major Support Levels to Watch**

Further weakness from current levels could see the shares initially fall to around $193. The price may encounter support near this month’s low, which closely aligns with a narrow consolidation period that formed on the chart in the back half of May last year.

The bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $169. Investors may seek buy-and-hold entry points in this location near April's prominent low and a brief period of sideways drift before the last May’s stock gap above the 200-day MA.

**Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor**

Upswings in the stock could see the price initially climb toward $215. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near a trendline that links a range of corresponding peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to June last year.

Finally, a more-bullish move in Apple shares could fuel a rally to around $237. Investors who bought at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region where notable peaks developed on the chart last July and October.",2025-05-26,43,14
1ktsorm_AAPL,AAPL,"Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq trim losses as Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple and EU","U.S. stocks fell Friday and were on track to record a weekly loss as investors assessed the potential impact of President Trump's latest tariff threats and his massive tax bill on the deficit and economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",2025-05-23,120,32

1️⃣ **First 1/4 on GDX calls** – betting on gold miners  
2️⃣ **First 1/4 on AAPL puts** – riding the bearish momentum  
*(Will scale in/out based on market moves!)*

# Why GDX over GLD?

✔ **Gold demand** – Classic hedge against inflation/chaos. If you think either’s rising, GDX wins.  
✔ **Industry consolidation** – Big mergers (Newmont-Goldcorp, Barrick-Randgold) = stronger, leaner miners  
✔ **Market fear** – When stocks tank, gold pumps. GDX benefits.  
✔ **Fed rate cuts** = Gold bullish. And if Trump’s trade war fails? He might start a real war or mess with gold reserves – more upside!  
✔ **Mining tech revolution** – AI/quantum computing slashes costs (Newmont’s error rate dropped from 35% → 8%). **2025 ROI forecast: 15.4%!**  
✔ **Green gold rush** – 54% of GDX companies are *zero-emission* (Barrick uses hydrogen trucks) EU carbon taxes? No problem

# Why short AAPL?

❌ **""Apple Tax"" under attack** – US court just ruled they *can’t* force devs to use their payment system (no more 30% cut!). Revenue killer  
❌ **China market shrinking** – Losing ground to local brands (Huawei, Xiaomi). iPhone = AAPL’s cash cow. If it stumbles, so does Apple  
❌ **Supply chain mess** – Tariffs + India move = higher costs, lower quality (remember those defective India-made iPhones?).  
❌ **Innovation lag** – Tech moves fast. If AAPL can’t keep up (looking at you, stagnant iPhone updates), they’re toast

1kfhbyc_AAPL,AAPL,Case Study: Berkshire's big bet on Apple in 2016,">*“I’m somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I’ve ever made Berkshire Hathaway.”*

During Berkshire’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett attributed much of Berkshire’s performance to the compounding ability of Apple ($AAPL). He went as far as thanking the CEO personally.

The Apple bet is notable not only for it’s fantastic returns, but by the shear scale of the capital deployed ($35 billion over the years). Berkshire’s investable universe is severely limited to large cap companies that can really “move the needle.” It is rare for large cap giants, covered by armies of analysts, to be severely mispriced. Seizing a large position in Apple during a period of temporary turbulence was a masterstroke. It is instructive to understand Berkshire’s reasoning at the time and what the situation looked like to most investors.

**The backdrop:**

While it does not seem that way now, in 2016 the Apple position was a deeply contrarian bet. Many market commentators proclaimed that Apple “lost its edge” and was well passed their prime. This was basically consensus opinion at the time, every analyst and news article was playing the same song. Here are a few headlines:During Berkshire’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett attributed much of Berkshire’s performance to the compounding ability of Apple ($AAPL). He went as far as thanking the CEO personally.

The Apple bet is notable not only for it’s fantastic returns, but by the shear scale of the capital deployed ($35 billion over the years). Berkshire’s investable universe is severely limited to large cap companies that can really “move the needle.” It is rare for large cap giants, covered by armies of analysts, to be severely mispriced. Seizing a large position in Apple during a period of temporary turbulence was a masterstroke. It is instructive to understand Berkshire’s reasoning at the time and what the situation looked like to most investors.

There were plenty of good reasons for Apple’s stock to fall at the time. Overall, they appeared to become a lethargic and oversized stalwart, likened to IBM. They lost their image as a fast growing innovator that had found its second wind in consumer electronics (it is easy to forget that Apple was founded back in 1976).

This was not a founder-led business anymore. During the Steve Jobs period, they had come up with sleek minimalist designs and a series of products that delighted consumers (iPod, iTouch and iPhone). By 2016 this momentum had stagnated, reflected in somewhat repetitive iterations of their products. Apple began to branch off into the car industry with *Project Titan,* which ran unsuccessfully from 2014-2024. This would be an example of Peter Lynch’s term “diworsification.” There were also a few short-term causes for concern:

1. Apple reported its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003.
2. First-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. Deemed to be over-reliant on the iPhone.
3. Spent more money on its new campus than on research and development.
4. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s online book/video services.

**In 2016, the company’s PE ratio dropped under 13** to complete the set-up. The **earnings yield was 8-9%** throughout the year.

**Taking out the big guns:**

Berkshire began with a $1 billion investment in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, increasing their position continuously over the course of the year. While market commentators were focused on short-term headwinds, Berkshire was focused on the underlying quality of Apple’s business. They saw through the noise and perceived the true *essence* of the business. The secret sauce.

In a press release from October 2016 by *Manager Magazin* (a German business magazine), Ted Weschler explained the rationale behind Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple investment:

>*Apple has elements of a subscription model that protects it from competition and could keep margins elevated for the long term, according to major investor Berkshire Hathaway. That is a large difference to former smartphone competitors Nokia, Blackberry and Motorola…*

>*Weschler says that the smartphone business had been transformed by the app economy and cloud computing. “As network speed has gotten faster and faster, and with it the information that people can absorb on the network, things like photo applications, and apps, they create a stickier ecosystem”. “Once you are fully invested in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousands of photographs up in the cloud and you are used to the keystrokes and functionality and where everything is, you become a sticky consumer.”*

They recognized the importance of a sticky ecosystem in retaining consumers over time. There was a powerful interplay between the Mac operating system, downloading from the iStore, listening to iTunes, storage on iCloud, communication on iMessenger/FaceTime and all the other products starting with “i”. Even their chargers were only compatible with Apple devices at the time. This ecosystem offered convenience for its users while secretly increasing switching costs. Consumers would have to expend mental effort in order to learn a new system that was less integrated.

Berkshire was not a group of technology experts, but they were experts on consumer behavior. While innovation was important, Apple did not need to produce the most advanced technology to be successful. Their higher profit margins were due to their brand image and the stickiness of their ecosystem. Buffett recognized that Apple users would rather “[give up a second car](https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/06/buffett-says-apple-best-business-of-any-he-owns/)” than give up their iPhone. Delighted customers translated into incredible brand loyalty and massive returns on capital. Even during the 2016-2017 trough, their ROIC hardly ever went below 20% before re-accelerating back into the 40% range. Maintaining a high ROIC over long periods of time is an indicator of a true competitive advantage.

**The Results:**

They added to their position continuously over the years and their total $35 billion investment was worth $173 billion in 2023.

1kcivlp_AAPL,AAPL,Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  

Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: 

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG 

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG 

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount 

The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. 

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. 

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  

“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” 

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  

“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. 

“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  

The company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a series of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world that could drastically alter the landscape of global trade, and consumer goods like iPhones could be among the hardest hit, analysts said on Thursday, with increases of 30% to 40% if the company were to pass on the cost to consumers.

Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.

Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year; its biggest markets include the United States, China and Europe.

The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% - if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers.

A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",2025-04-03,215,63
1jfvft3_AAPL,AAPL,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",2025-03-20,1324,219
1jf4eql_AAPL,AAPL,Apple's 'Siri-Ous' Problem - Here's Why I'm Bearish on AAPL,"Okay, Apple fans (or Cook loyalists), let me finish before you go on a rampage. I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

1idy8n6_AAPL,AAPL,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

1gh5qdg_AAPL,AAPL,Globalstar (GSAT) Soars on Expanded Agreement with Apple (AAPL),"
Globalstar (GSAT) saw its stock surge as much as 64% in pre-market trading on news that it expanded its agreement with Apple (AAPL, Financial). The stock later settled at a 45% gain. This new service agreement involves Globalstar providing enhanced mobile satellite services to Apple, which includes a new satellite constellation, additional ground infrastructure, and increased global licensing. The enhanced network will be managed by a unit within Globalstar SPE.

As part of this agreement, Apple will prepay Globalstar up to $1.1 billion to fund approved capital expenditures related to the expanded Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) network. These funds will be disbursed quarterly during the construction phase. Globalstar SPE will use these funds and proceeds from stock sales to cover costs for the MSS network expansion, including construction and launch costs. Additionally, Globalstar will allocate funds to repay its 13.00% senior notes due in 2029, as outlined in the ""2024 Prepayment Agreement.""

Furthermore, Apple has agreed to purchase 400,000 Class B shares of Globalstar SPE, representing 20% equity, for $400 million. The payment is expected around November 5, 2024, subject to closing conditions. Globalstar projects that its annual revenue in the first year after the satellite service expansion will more than double the annualized level of 2024",2024-11-01,16,15

","Hello to everyone, 



As per the title of this post, I am new to day trading, been doing it for around a month now, to some degree of success (if you can call it that). I only operate from a cash account, and my trading balance is around $20k. The main stock that I trade is AAPL, I've been studying its charts for the past weeks, to try and get the hang of it. 

I've been able to average around $0.5-1/share, trading a volume of around 70 to 90 stocks each day. I'm not trying to get rich here, just trying to see if it's something that can bring me an extra steady source of income. The only indicator I use is SMA and that only to some extent; I mainly try to get that $0.5-1/share profit and I'm out. I don't get care for the ""big gains"", which seems more dangerous than playing the roulette. 

The past weeks have been ok, seeing some volatility in the stock and being able to find an enter and exit point, except for past Tuesday, 09/03/24. That day scared me the most (having lost a few bucks), because there was absolutely no entry point, or at least one that I could see. It opened at 228.55, high 229 for a second I think, low 221.17 and closed at 222.77. AAPL's volatility is around $2-4/day, but on this day, it mainly just went down, there was little to no rebounce. I know there's an option to short stocks, but you need a margin account for that and I don't feel ready yet to borrow money to day trade it. 

Given my situation, of a cash account, what would have been a day trading strategy for AAPL on 09/03/24? Except for not trading at all, but that's kind of difficult, not being able to foresee the future and just saying no for a day.



Sorry if I have offended anybody with my noob questions and with my English (it's not my primary language). I attached a chart for AAPL 09/03/24, ignore the trading hours (UTC +3)

1fc881s_AAPL,AAPL,The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage),"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

1f8aj9a_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL vs. NVDA Comps,"I consider AAPL a good reference point for NVDA considering there aren’t many companies with market caps so high.

For the last quarter, AAPL’s revenue was **85.78B** compared to **30.04B** for NVDA. But of course their margins are different - AAPL’s is close to **25%**, while NVDA’s is close to **50%**. That’s how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA’s value should be about 77.39% of AAPL’s. Looking at today’s market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA’s value at 78.30% of AAPL’s, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone. 

But of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company’s valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL’s net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA’s **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.

Why then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA’s net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL’s did in the past year?

One more thing: I haven’t accounted for after-hours action, so NVDA’s slight premium over AAPL based upon net income alone is probably gone now.

Positions: Long NVDA, NVDU, NVDA Dec calls.

1eu0gpb_AAPL,AAPL,Berkshire selling Apple 2024 2Q,"So BRK sold half of it’s 5.6% ownership of APPL and there has been a lot of speculation as to why.  I base my analysis on the idea of discounting cash, in particular, the retained earnings of APPL attributable to the ownership of BRK. The 5.6% ownership generates 5.6 billion of retained earnings yearly (Warren even mentions it in an annual shareholder letter, but the calculation is trivial). Now, *given current interest* rates one can earn 5.5 billion just by having 100 billion invested in US T-bills.

Considering that the market cap for APPL in this period was 3300 billion, then 5.6% gives us 184 billion of market value. In other words, BRK could sell a little over half of its holdings and have 84 billion invested at AAPL and 100 billion in cash. Thus, it will have 2 billion in retained earnings, *plus* 5.5 billion of the 100 billion *in cash* it would get from the transaction.

It might be argued that interest rates could drop substantially, but again at current market levels this would not be the case unless the market went down considerably. In which case the yearly interest does go down, but then the usefulness of the 100 billion in cash does skyrocket. Finally, corporate taxes at 21% did made Warren justify a bit that it’s not necessarily a bad rate compared to what it can be (52% in the past).",2024-08-16,6,6

❗️The Market Just Flipped the Script

For the last couple of years, we’ve been living in an upside-down world where bad economic news was actually good news for investors. The logic? If the economy looked rough, the Fed might ease up on those pesky interest rates. But now, we’re back in the real world—bad news is just…well, bad.

Let’s talk numbers: The latest employment data is out, and it's not pretty. Unemployment has crept up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Employers added a measly 114,000 jobs in July, a far cry from last year’s monthly average of 251,000. It’s like expecting fireworks and getting a sparkler.

But wait—there's a twist. Some experts are saying that the rise in unemployment is due to temporary layoffs, so this could just be a blip rather than the beginning of a downward spiral. Still, the S&P 500 ($SPY) didn’t take the news lightly, dropping around 2% in what might be the biggest market slump over jobs data in two years.

The Fed’s Tightrope Walk Just Got Trickier

If you’re scratching your head wondering why the market had a meltdown over a job report, here’s the tea: Investors are spooked that the Fed might have overdone it with the rate hikes. The delicate balance between cooling inflation and keeping the economy afloat is starting to look more like a juggling act with one too many balls.

Here’s where it gets juicy: Just yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. But with this latest job data, economists are now betting the Fed might have to slash rates even deeper than anticipated. Think of it as the Fed hitting the brakes a little too late, and now everyone’s bracing for a bumpy ride.

Despite the drama, analysts are urging investors to keep calm and carry on. Volatility might be making a comeback, but that’s par for the course as the Fed gets ready to shift gears.

In short, the market’s mood just did a 180, and we’re all buckled in for whatever comes next.

Earnings Olympics: Winners and Losers

This week’s earnings reports felt like a high-stakes competition, with some companies nailing their routines while others took a tumble. Let’s take a look at who’s bringing home the gold and who’s licking their wounds.

Intel’s Bad Day

Intel ($INTC) had a week so rough, it could use a hug. The chipmaker saw its stock nosedive by 26.06%—its worst single-day performance since the Nixon era—after missing earnings expectations left and right. Revenue fell short at $12.83 billion versus the anticipated $12.98 billion, and EPS was a jaw-dropping 80% lower than expected at just $0.02. To top it off, Intel announced a 15% workforce reduction, meaning 15,000 employees are getting the pink slip.

Apple Bites Back

On the flip side, Apple ($AAPL) kept the doctor away with some solid numbers. The tech giant reported $85.78 billion in revenue, outpacing expectations of $84.38 billion, and EPS hit $1.40, beating the $1.34 forecast. iPhone sales made up nearly half of Apple’s total revenue, but the real MVP was the iPad, with sales skyrocketing 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion.

Amazon’s Mixed Bag

Amazon ($AMZN) gave investors a rollercoaster ride, plunging 8.78% despite a mostly solid report. The company missed on revenue, pulling in $147.98 billion compared to the $148.76 billion expected, but managed to beat EPS estimates with $1.26 versus the anticipated $1.02. While its ad business grew 20%, it still didn’t meet the $13 billion sales target, clocking in at $12.8 billion.

Carvana’s Comeback

Carvana ($CVNA) was the comeback kid of the week, with shares surging after an earnings surprise. The online car dealer reported an EPS of $0.39, smashing the expected loss of -$0.12. Revenue also cruised past expectations at $3.41 billion, up 15% from last year. The cherry on top? Carvana sold 101,000 vehicles this quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year.



Microsoft’s AI Miss

Microsoft ($MSFT) had a mixed day, staying mostly on target but missing the mark on AI. The tech titan reported EPS of $2.95, barely above the expected $2.94, and revenue of $64.73 billion, edging out the $64.44 billion forecast. However, its “intelligence” cloud revenue, which includes its AI efforts, came in at $28.5 billion, just shy of the $28.7 billion target, leaving investors less than thrilled.

In the chaotic world of earnings, one slip can send stocks tumbling, while nailing the numbers keeps you in the winner's circle.



On The Horizon

What’s Coming Next Week:

After a rollercoaster of economic announcements, next week is shaping up to be a much-needed breather. We’ll get a few data points—July ISM services on Monday, June trade balance on Tuesday, and June consumer credit on Wednesday—but nothing that’s likely to shake the market’s foundation.

However, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims report is the one to watch. Given how this week’s job numbers rattled investors, these reports are becoming key indicators for where the market might head next.



Earnings to Watch:

With 70% of the S&P 500 having already spilled the tea on their quarterly earnings, and Big Tech mostly out of the way, you’d think we could relax. But no, there are still some big names reporting next week that you’ll want to keep an eye on:

Monday: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Hims & Hers Health ($HIMS), Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), The Carlyle Group ($CG)

Tuesday: Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

Wednesday: Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

Thursday: Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

Friday: Hawaiian Electric Industries ($HE), Getty Images ($GETY), Canopy Growth ($CGC), Soho House & Co. ($SHCO)

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

1efqydk_AAPL,AAPL,"10K AAPL right now, hold 18 months","# Why

I believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis and stock is already reflecting the AI hype around Apple Intelligence, but not the earnings and the impact of the tech when it actually releases for the public. 18 months is the time in which I believe there will be a positive impact reflected back into the stock price. 

# Diversification

Apple saw an increase in services revenue of 3B every year, and it can only grow. The main difference now is that there is AI and a better overall experience that can be sold at a higher price than usual. I can see how they will try to implement a better paywalled AI around the release of iOS 19, boosting other services with an Apple One pack. 

# No one upgrades, except this time

Older iPhones are not AI capable, and everyone that wants the new toy will have a reason to upgrade, the first real reason to upgrade since the iPhone X release. 



Not to mention the countless memes we will get, 2008 style dumb Siri videos. Unrelated, but can't wait for it.   




All considered I think they will get a huge boost in revenue, more fidelization and better diversification. Stock will grow, maintaining trajectory, good for investors.

1e3vtow_AAPL,AAPL,"Morgan Stanley names Apple as a ""top pick"" for AI efforts, raises price target from $216 to $273 ($4.2T market cap)","(Reuters) -Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a ""top pick,"" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

The stock has an average rating of ""buy"" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.

Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.

Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.",2024-07-15,351,133

1dylq15_AAPL,AAPL,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

1drkuxt_AAPL,AAPL,$AAPL's AI Play: Following a Familiar Pattern to Success?,"Apple's recent AI integration using OpenAI has been making waves, but many think they're late to the party. I'm wondering if there's more to their strategy than meets the eye. Are they truly behind, or is this a calculated move we're not seeing as consumers?

Let's look at Apple's history:

1. iPhones: Used Samsung processors for models 1-3, then switched to in-house A-series chips from iPhone 4 onward.
2. Macs: Relied on Intel from 2006-2020, now transitioning to their own M-series (Apple Silicon).

My theory? Apple's following a familiar playbook:

1. Integrate existing AI tech (OpenAI)
2. Develop in-house models in parallel
3. Eventually phase out external AI for proprietary solutions

These in-house AI models would likely be optimized for Apple's custom chips, just like their current software. This could give them a significant edge in performance and efficiency.

Apple's success often comes from perfecting technologies rather than being first. They've shown they can dominate markets they enter late (smartphones, tablets, smartwatches).

What do you think? Will Apple stick to this pattern for AI, or will they continue relying on external providers? How might this impact $AAPL's long-term value?

1di3gxc_AAPL,AAPL,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a [10-1 stock split in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-announces-10-for-1-stock-split.html).",2024-06-05,573,149

1czl7bs_AAPL,AAPL,Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

1cn5fpj_AAPL,AAPL,Are you worried about AAPL long term? ,"Now I’m not saying to sell all of your Apple stock immediately. However, given that:

1. The Vision Pro was a dud, they’re pulling back manufacturing/production

2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%

3. Services didn’t grow as much as we thought they would

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they’re doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

5. Slow growth in critical markets like China

6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What’s the next new thing? 

Do I think Apple is doomed? Absolutely not. I love their products, especially the m series MacBooks.

1ciq1fw_AAPL,AAPL,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

“If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.  

“We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

“I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

Will this squeeze off this support and head back to ~$200 during March? What do you guys think? Will people buy the AI rumor off this 180 low. The classic buy the rumor, sell the news may happen I don’t know. But previous years have shown March to be a good month for APPL.

Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.   
  
While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible

Apple suppliers, including Largan Precision and Luxshare Precision Industry, have seen their stocks drop.

- Tensions between China and the U.S. have already caused changes in Apple's supply chain, with some iPhone models now being manufactured in India and Vietnam.

14guw7p_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.  
  
The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.  
  
Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn’t last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year’s end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.  
  
And while Apple stock saw the company’s valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn’t closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.  
  
Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.  
  
In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.

I'm currently in the journey to learn how to be a profitable scalper. After close to a year into my journey, I've decided to purely focus on a basketball of stocks (e.g., AAPL,TSLA, NVDA).  I've heard about traders being profitable by just trading one ticker and I'd like to find out if this is possible. 

As practice, I've been eyeballing them for everyday for awhile now and just getting used to how they move. 

I'd like to (if at all possible) focus on these stocks and be very familiar with their price action , idiosyncrasies and characteristics. My focus is to only focus on the first hour.

Problem is, I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for and it's probably too soon for me understand the nuances of each of these stocks.

Do these stocks react at certain levels? Do they act a certain way during a time of the day? Are they sensitive to movements of the SPY or QQQ?

  
Any pros out there care to provide some guidance on this? Or is this a futile endeavour?  


Cheers

AAPL short to $158 - $154 price target. Stop Loss = $184

I won't explain my work specifically. It's rooted in linear regression and a one time framing which is a pit trading term. I doubt many here know what any of that is.

Basically one time framing is a liquidity driven phenomenon as old as 1870s so ... 150+ year track record. It's defined loosely as ever bar (frame) closes higher than previously, no more than two bars close same price or lower. When it closes same price or lower it half backs.

The linear regression confirms this half back as the daily linear regression is the bottom slanted green arrow. The price is in alignment with the 200day.

The confluences are too great to ignore.

As we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.

However, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.

Finally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.

**Daily Chart**

Bears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.

Bears swept the previous day's low at 409.97 and grabbed liquidity at the order block from May 10th. Buyers came in with increased volume. We saw a character change at 410.70 and swept liquidity at 411.58. We have resting liquidity above at 412.01. On the late bounce, bulls created a fair value gap at 410.47 - 410.80 and 410.39 - 410.27, currently holding as support AH. On the way down, bears left a few fair value gaps at 412.40 - 412.52 and 412.93 - 413.16 that bulls will look to fill on Monday. The current price action favors the bulls here.

As you can see that we are currently in the sell side premium as we are below the 50% retracement at 411.67. Shorting at the current price doesn’t look attractive to me.

If the fair value gaps hold pre-market and we have a gap up, here are the sell-side discounts. Note that these would be points of reversal where we could see a failure and more upside.

124jghc_AAPL,AAPL,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.

The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).

Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.

So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",2023-03-28,261,82

There are lots of multinational companies, whose fortunes - and stock prices - are certainly affected by the economies of other countries that they have significant operations in.

A lot of the dividend ETFs - and even some REITs - that we like to talk about a lot here on this sub own nice big chunks of these multinationals.  Isn't that enough international exposure?

zxp08y_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL Intrinsic Value of 1.7T - DCF of Owner Earnings,"[https://imgur.com/a/sTWQQaR](https://imgur.com/a/sTWQQaR)

Owner Earnings = Operating CF - Depreciation (i.e. Approximation of maintenance Capex) - SBC

Comparing 3-year average of OE 2011-2012-2013 vs 2020-2021-2022, Apple OE doubled over 10 years, or roughly 7% CAGR.  This seems low, but perhaps representative of Apple size problem.

With a personal required return of 10%, I get 1.7T DCF

Using 9% required return, I get 2T so roughly at today closing price of 126$.

If I look beyond next year troubles (Foxconn, China Covid, potential recession, PC slow down, EU Appstore), Apple seems to be a steady and profitable business long term.

Hope you can point out obvious and significant errors to fine-tune the estimation.  Thanks.

—
Additional info, OE ratio is about 20x.  Doing the following Buffett/Comb test, it’s failing the first criteria of 15x.

« Combs goes to Buffett’s house on many Saturdays to talk, and here’s a litmus test they frequently use. Warren asks “How many names in the S&P are going to be 15x earnings in the next 12 months? How many are going to earn more in five years (using a 90% confidence interval), and how many will compound at 7% (using a 50% confidence interval)?” In this exercise, you are solving for cyclicality, compounding, and initial price. Combs said that this rubric was used to find Apple, since at the time the same 3-5 names kept coming up. »",2022-12-28,8,19

I am just starting out with options and I sold a put for AAPL @ 138 for 05/20/2022 and AAPL closed at **137.59,** so technically it should have assigned to me right, but it expired --  **1  PUT AAPL 05/20/22 138 APPLE INC OPTION EXPIRATION - EXPIRED.**

I was under the impression that if the price closed below 138, it would have assigned to me, so if someone could explain why was it not assign to me, that would be great.

Thanks

Edit (May 23 2022):

To close out this POST, I DID NOT get assigned AAPL shares, even though the close price 137.59 was below the strike price 138. I called the broker and it seems that they are not 100% sure as well but what they are almost certain had happened is the buyer of the contract did not exercise the option. So the lesson learned (for me) is that buyers of the contracts can deny to exercise the option.

Also, once I got the alert that it had expired, that was basically it, I didnt have to call the brokerage to get more details on this.

Thanks everyone for the comments and concerns, I appreciated them all.",2022-05-22,77,136

tn3462_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL is now less than 5% off of its highs,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again?

t4162t_AAPL,AAPL,Opinion: $Aapl will be the best dividend/ income generating stock I will own by the time I retire in 20-30 years.,"Not that bold of a statement I just made, however, I often see short term dividend advice on here rather than long term, which I have fallen victim to as a younger investor. 

I’m in early 30’s and find myself chasing high yield stocks/ ETF’s too often in an effort to grow my annual dividends. 
I have stumbled into some great long term holds from advice on this sub with $abbv, $avgo, $msft, $schd etc. but have also made many mistakes along the way. 

However, I can’t stop thinking that by the time retire in 20-30 years, accumulating as many $Aapl shares now will be the best long term dividend play I can make. 

If a new investor asked me today the best foundational place to park money for a healthy future dividend income, I would simply answer $Aapl and $Schd.

$Aapl will most likely continue to raise its dividends annually and possibly split 1 or more times (in my lifetime). With the dominance of $Aapl today, why wouldn’t it either continue to grow or slowly transition into a higher dividend paying gem if business levels off down the road?

I am not saying to go all in on $Aapl but I feel if you have decades ahead until retirement, $Aapl should be viewed more as a long term dividend giant - coupled with ETF’s and others companies you find in your  journey.

$aapl last 12 years: 1535% 

$msft last 12 years: 1169%

$goog last 12 years: 951%

no way to tell if they'll produce the same yields for 12 more years (doubtful if I'd have to guess but who knows) and not all have dividends / as high as $voo, but seems like throwing some money across those or $nvda, $amzn for another 5-10 years would be ""safer"" if you just close your portfolio and look back, or DCA at a reoccurring set timeframe. 

There will be stocks that outperform, but are apple, miscrosoft, google, amazon going away anytime soon? Maybe just throwing in $voo you wouldn't have to worry i guess haha.

scz42n_AAPL,AAPL,Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued,"Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.

Right now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.

Let's observe the last 4 years of revenue:

* 2018 = $266B
* 2019 = $260B
* 2020 = $275B
* **2021 = $366B**

One of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.

I'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.

**RUSH**

When a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.

**CRUSH**

The next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**

**HUSH**

2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.

In the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).

Essentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.

I read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!

Would love to see your thoughts below. I'm sure this will be controversial and I look forward to hearing the opposite side of this argument to see what I might be overlooking.",2022-01-26,46,141

rv92bv_AAPL,AAPL,"Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html

“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”",2022-01-03,4094,571

pm1mz0_AAPL,AAPL,Is now a good time to buy $AAPL? (Apple Inc.),"Apple perhaps is one of the most popular stock being the highest market cap and found it many investor’s portfolio. After dipping due to the in-app purchase lawsuit with Epic Games, I couldn’t resist and bought a few shares of my first $AAPL stock ~$150 planning to hold them for many years. 

Is $AAPL always a good buy at any price? Especially the iPhone 13 event is coming next week, it could dip even further and when Apple Car is ready it can be huge in the future EV market.

plxv88_AAPL,AAPL,"If Apple comes out with a car, are you buying an Apple car or a Tesla? TSLA 3,000 is higher then AAPL, Be honest, very curious, Cathie Says","Good evening everyone and thank you so much for reading my posts. There are debates everywhere abou TSLA valuation so I am not here to go into that. It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k…..

This post is not about that though…however Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \[Mind you she just dumped… along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL. Nearly 2.5 trillion…

TSLA is thought as of the car/tech of the future…Many believe that APPLE is the best innovator… It has been rumored over a year that Apple has plans to possibly team up with a car manufacturer and make an APPLE car….

So the question is simple. If both cars come out, both cars are near the same price…be honest which do you buy? This happened with Blackberry, Iphone and Samsung…

Thank you for taking the time. Please share thoughts, ideas… or if you think someone will overtake Apple and Tesla in the next few years.",2021-09-11,0,140

Everything Apple has been doing lately has me thinking it's likely to fall soon due to their upcoming security changes. I'm have a relatively small position 10 shares at 127.96. So I won't be making a huge profit but I do think Apple might be a buy in the future when its cheap again. I like Apple products but their security update is seriously having many people globally hesitant to the stance the brand is taking. Is it time to take profits? Thoughts?

&#x200B;

edit: Based on all the comments I decided to hold and will buy more during the next dip as I have no real need for the cash. For those mentioning taxes here in Canada my AAPL stocks are in a TFSA (Tax free savings account) which means gains and withdrawal are non taxable.

I'm up 150% on them but my gut tells me I would be best to wait till end of next week as I'm expecting the stock price to still continue to rise.

ARK-Logo-Black By Frank Downing | @downingARK
Analyst
This week, Apple's World Wide Developer Conference kicked off with a jam-packed keynote featuring a host of software and services updates. A common thread throughout the event was an emphasis on enabling Apple users to share data and experiences seamlessly throughout its ecosystem, all with privacy in mind.

SharePlay, an open API for synchronous content streaming, will enable users to listen to Apple Music or watch a show from HBO Max together with family and friends on a FaceTime call. Combined with Spatial Audio call scheduling and enhanced sharing features in iMessage, the new service will make communication on an Apple device more immersive and convenient.
In a push to address the digital identity problem and eliminate the need for physical wallets, Apple announced Digital ID, a digital copy of a user's driver's license or state ID, which the TSA intends to adopt. Apple could leverage this digital identity to reduce the friction in the authentication for apps and services.
Apple Health users will be able to share data like activity levels, sleep quality, and heart rates with their physicians and loved ones. This data could inform treatment decisions and alert family members to changes in health associated with irregular heartbeats and accidental falls, among many others.
Combined with new privacy features like on-device voice recognition and IP Address hiding, we believe each of these new services is likely to increase the Apple's ecosystem stickiness as the social economy’s privacy-first player.",2021-06-15,4,3
nrnnv0_AAPL,AAPL,I think AAPL is at its peak and starts to show bearish signs,"Today  is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making  machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation  potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The  headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad  shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13  shipment due to no breaking changes.

In  addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and  inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of  many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also,  three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem  AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big  growth area for AAPL.

Among a  dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New  Street’s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have  downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160,  average is $157.10, high is $185.

What do you think about AAPL?

njt2n5_AAPL,AAPL,Apple Inc - A Speculative Analysis (NYSE: AAPL),"# Introduction:

Welcome back to my weekly stock analysis. Disclaimer: I'm an android user, prefer windows/linux

Apple Inc (NYSE: AAPL)
Sector: Consumer Electronics (Technology)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Apple is a Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, S&P 100 and S&P 500 component. They are an American tech company out of California. Apple is the 4th largest PC vendor and is one of the most well known companies with almost cult-like brand loyalty.

Strengths:
- Nice historical price appreciation
- S&P 100 and 500 component, Dow Jones component
- low payout ratios

Risks:
- low yield (I know some of you care more for income than growth)
- High PE (historical average 22)
- Corporate greed with product design is becoming more apparent.
- low leverage
- cyclical free cash flow per share

## Financial History and numbers

AAPL: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue) as of May 24 2021


Stock                          |  AAPL
-----------------------------|--------
P/E Ratio                    | 28.06
Stock price                  | $125.43
Current Annual Payout/Share | $0.88
Yield                       | 0.70% 
5 Yr Div Growth Rate       | 9.41%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 8.43% 
1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 6.49% 
Years Of Growth             | 8
Current Payout Ratio        | 17.05% 
Free Cash Flow / Share      | 1.0183
Revenue (ttm)                | 325.406B 
Debt / Equity Ratio         | 1.57
Debt / EBITDA            | 1.09
EPS                            | 4.48 
ROE            | 11.80% 
ROI            | 31.7% 

AAPL is poised to offer great returns. The payout ratio suggests that AAPL is growing, as backed by the 0.70 yield. The PE ratio is very high but seems on par with historical 22 PE ratio. Revenue is growing. My biggest fear is really in the free cash flow. This is something I'd look into for further research.

I will now use the 3 year dividend growth rate to project to the future.

Year                       | AAPL
------------------------| -------
2022                      | 0.95
2023                      | 1.03 
2024                      | 1.12
2025                      | 1.22 

For another way, let's use historical payout ratio to project out.

YEAR                    | AAPL
----------------------- | ------ 
EPS estimate 2021  | 5.16
EPS estimate 2022  | 5.31
2021 dividend           | 0.88
2022 dividend           | 0.91

## Final Thoughts:
AAPL isn't some unheard of company, in fact it's well mentioned. Why would I need to bring up the bull case? I hope to impart some of my views more than “it's Apple, duh”.

####USER CASE
In terms of operating systems and functionality, there are 3 main choices. Linux is second most preferred for programmers (edited from most optimal for programmers), Windows is gaming oriented, and Mac handles the creative suite the best. [source for linux claim](https://www.statista.com/statistics/869211/worldwide-software-development-operating-system/). That is not to say that Windows can't run the Adobe suite. No. But, Mac seems to handle alignment and trackpads much better, the times that i've used Macs.

Second, the iCloud is a highly underappreciated feature. Having all of your devices in sync by default is great. Needing to add OneDrive or Dropbox is a nuisance. Anyone who has tried to reconcile Git repositories will tell you that rebasing can be a pain. 

Next, User retention: AAPL handles this… well, to an extent. AAPL is good at assuming people are technologically inadequate and provides accordingly. You can still go hop on the mac terminal and vim away, but for the most part, everything is low level. I don't like the high cost of entry that only seems to go exponentially higher, and don't like that Apple seems to be removing parts and repair policies just for more money. That being said, AAPL seems to be dipping its hands in everything. Apple Watch having messaging, and health capabilities, rumors of the car, itunes, safari, everything seems to just be meant to entice you to stay.

####Epic Games vs Apple
I can't believe this is even a discussion but somehow it is. Let's start with the case. This all started as a breach of contract that was heavily planned by Epic. Under the App Store, Apple is supposed to receive a cut of all in game content to the tune of 30%. Epic games circumvented this by offering users a discount when paid via the epic games’ store. Upon immediate removal by Apple and Google, Epic launched a [PR campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPn_PGuYesw) fairly quickly. What should be an open and shut case is dragging out and dragging other franchises in. Some of the cruxes are: What is an app, What is a game, and is Apple anti-competitive? Roblox recently rebranded to an app because Apple classifies it as an app. 

Regardless of the anti-competitive outcome, to have the influence to change the classification of a game to an app is understated. AAPL might have to reduce the commission, and google will likely have to follow, but I dont think this affects AAPL as much as it hurts Epic. Apple can't be called a monopoly as it has to compete with Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Activision, and others. Just like how Microsoft bailed out Apple from bankruptcy, I think this will likely happen again unless a new competitor arises.

The last thing, AAPL’s price seems to be converging between 124 and 126. What happens next could be a jump or crater in stock price. I look forward to seeing what happens.

Weekly price estimate for a future date, via consulting the crystal ball:
Predicted price for AAPL for May 26, 2021: $124.42. There is no factual basis that I will give.

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.

mvzib7_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL Earnings Play,"Played AAPL earnings for two quarters. It's been the same both times (third time's the charm?). There is always a run up until right before earnings then it stagnates/drop post earnings.

Earnings will likely be good since we know iPhone orders will be good and new products (even potential EV market entry hints). Not to mention their dominance in the app store market. Take for example Match whose biggest expense is paying AAPL 500M+ in fees to the app store anually.

Earnings: Post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $77.62 billion, up 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.

**Price Target**: 136-140 going to next week's earnings. 140+ if news cycle decides to pump AAPL 

*Technical/Astrology:* 

\- Going to retest 135 this week and run up until earnings

\- Cup and Handle forming, today the handle was maintained as the stock rose and reclaimed 133.50, Green Hammer seen as well, indicating a reversal upwards which supports said thesis

Am I right for the most part?

I tell myself that as long as I get 10% a year from either of them I'm ok.  Heck even 5% is more than my bank account!  Although I think I should hopefully get a little better than that.

The cryptocurrency market as a whole has become approximately as valuable as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-biggest company in the world after Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco (SE:2222).

The milestone also comes less than three months after the cryptocurrency market surpassed $1 trillion for the first time back on Jan. 7 when the price of Bitcoin was around $33,000.

Will the Ethereum and altcoin bull market continue?

In recent months, several major catalysts have fueled both Bitcoin and Ether to rally strongly to new all-time highs.

Financial institutions, like PayPal and Visa, are beginning to actively support cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the cryptocurrency market's uptrend.

In 2021, Bitcoin has faced several short-term corrections but has now consistently remained above $50,000 for almost a month, with low volatility compared with altcoins, preventing both ETH and the altcoin market from seeing a severe pullback.

In fact, Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to the lowest level since November 2020 as BTC price has been consolidating between $55,000 and $60,000 over the past few days.",2021-04-05,6,0

Then you have the vaccine. Money will surely be taken out of tech stocks like Apple and allocated into beat down stocks. I should have thought about this play harder. What's your take on it?

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Apple 2003 [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

If Apple was to introduce their own search engine, this practice would obviously cease. For almost anyone else, it would be laughable to try and compete with Google’s search engine, but we are talking about a company with more cash than any other, ever. They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business. The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Google’s stock price? Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.

j9vc7m_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL cash secured put with the goal to be assigned,"Hi guys,

I would like to increase my long stock positions for AAPL, as I was never able to restore the size of it after March crash.

I was thinking to sell a CSP (cash secured put) strike 150$ for Jan'21 in my PM account.

Today that CSP would be trading around 30$, which would give me a cost basis of 120$ if assigned. I would sell it in the next days into weakness (if any), hopefully then making a little more than that. 

I would like to further reduce that cost basis, hence was thinking to start selling ""kind of"" covered calls for the upcoming monthlies (Nov, Dec, Jan), hence acting like I already own the stock.

Is there anything that can go wrong with this synthetic buy/write, other than the stock tanking? I am thinking long term hence no harm with the price going down.

Edit: important point. I'm not a US resident nor taxpayer

ixn5o0_AAPL,AAPL,"$AAPL - Raymond James raise estimates ahead of iPhone 12 launch on ""favorable mix""","Raymond James:

We reiterate our Outperform rating on Apple and raise our price target to $120. Raising our estimates following our production checks ahead of next quarter’s iPhone 12 launch. While our total production estimates are in-line with current consensus, we expect upside driven by mix. Current production plans suggest the most favorable mix we’ve ever seen for an iPhone launch, and the introduction of a fourth iPhone model at a price between iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will also help to boost blended ASPs. While the stock has already had a strong run since our upgrade last summer, **we don’t yet think all the benefits of what we expect to be a 2-year 5G upgrade cycle are yet reflected in consensus estimates.**

iPhone 12 mix and pricing. **We conducted channel checks across the iPhone supply chain last week, and confirmed that Apple will launch four new models** in the iPhone 12 lineup this year: an entry-level iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Max, Pro, and Max Pro. We provide a breakdown of specs for each model on the following page. While our sources don't have visibility into pricing at this point, we would expect the base model to start at $699 - the same as last year's iPhone 11, but with a smaller screen. We expect the Pro and Max Pro to remain premium tier phones, priced at $999 and $1099 to start. For the iPhone Max, we expect Apple to likely price it at a modest premium to the base model, in the range of $799.

**Our production checks are consistent with consensus expectations, but mix appears favorable.** According to our checks, build plans support production of \~75 million units for the launch, including 64 million new models. While we believe this is consistent with industry expectations, the mix assumptions driven by the initial build plans **suggest a meaningful rise in blended ASPs**. There's no guarantee that current build plans will reflect what consumers will actually buy, but the build plans provide insight into Apple's expectations. The table on the following page illustrates our production and sell-through estimates for the December quarter. We're assuming that Apple will build more aggressively on higher priced SKUs to make sure they are available for holiday purchases, and we expect that lower priced SKUs will likely sell out before Christmas.

Adjusting estimates. While our September quarter estimates remain unchanged (and well below consensus), we are **raising our FY21 EPS estimate to $3.93 to reflect our current assumptions for iPhone 12 mix**. Notably, if we assume December quarter sell-through matches production estimates, our revenue and EPS estimates would move higher by \~$5.3 billion and $0.09, respectively. For FY22, our split-adjusted estimate moves to $4.53, assuming Apple keeps the fourtier pricing scheme for the upcoming iPhone 13 and 14 cycles.

Our new $120 price target (from $110) is based on a \~26x multiple on our split-adjusted FY22 EPS estimate and 19x an annualized estimate of peak seasonal EPS of over $6/share. While this is above the 3- and 5-year average in the \~15x range, on an EV/FCF basis, our price target assumes an 18x multiple, well below the historical range in the low-20s.",2020-09-22,185,37
iv9y63_AAPL,AAPL,I bought A LOT of AAPL shares. Now I’m losing A LOT of money.,"I had the misfortune of materially entering the stock market for my first time two days before AAPL tanked. This was the first time I put a sizable chunk of cash into any stock. I was ecstatic when I made $100’s after the first day, but now I’m borderline panicking because I’ve now lost $1,000’s. The way I see it, it would have been better to sell at a loss a week ago, saved $1,000 bucks, then buy again once AAPL started to gain. 

Another week has passed, and I’m down even further. 

Proposed solution: If I sell now at a loss, my money stops shrinking. That way, I can be in a better position to buy when AAPL starts growing again. 

Would you sell now or would you hold on? Why?

is67ve_AAPL,AAPL,Analysis of AAPL bullish option plays and they don't look good,"I received a call a week before Apple's split 4:1 asking whether they should buy shares for their long term account before the split or after the split. I gave my canned stock split pitch about how the value of the company is the same before and after the split, that you own the same (tiny) percentage of shares, etc. If one is buying as an investment, then it doesn't really matter when you buy. An investor should generally put his or her money to work as soon as possible and then wait. If you want to minimize potential regret, one can divide their capital into equal pieces and buy on a fixed schedule (25% on the first of the next 4 months, for example).

Back to AAPL - in case you missed it (and if you're reading this, you haven't), since they announced on the stock split on the 30th, AAPL shot up leading into the split. Shortly after it gave back much of those gains as most of the market has dropped:

Full disclosure I'm long AAPL and will probably add a few shares tomorrow as part of my mechanical buying of it each month - building a long term investment in the name. It is one of the names I trade frequently on my watch list, but I don't see a lot of good bullish options in the name right now. Let's break down a couple common option strategies, an example idea for each, and an explanation on why I'd avoid it for the time being:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t4gk7yq27zm51.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ac495a7d884ccdd4da12f09ed9b6808b4020ef3

**Buy a call**

The most straightforward bullish option position. If we're bullish near-term, we could look at the October 16th, at-the-money call. The 112.5 strike can be purchased for 6.45 at the ask. It is expensive. That's almost 6% of the underlying for an option expiring in 33 days. Note also that the Implied Volatility remains high compared to the long term values in AAPL. Pre-COVID, AAPL hadn't hit a 50 vol since the large sell-off at the end of 2018 (Christmas Eve).

One could go further in time to the January ATM call and pick up the 112.5 strike for 11.25. That gets you almost 4x as long for AAPL to go up for less than 2x the price. If I had to buy a call, I would go longer term, but again, the Implied vol is still about 44% out in January and we'd be spending 10% of the price of the underlying - I'd rather buy 10 shares.

**Sell a put**

If IV is high, we should simply sell a put, right? Let's look at the October 16th, 100 put. It can be sold for about $2. This is a decent return - about 2% in a little over 1 month. I still wouldn't sell it though.

Take a look at historical volatility. AAPL is currently moving more than the options have priced. I try to avoid selling options in these scenarios. HV is at 53% and the option we'd sell is at 48%.

**Summary**

It is OK to Not take a trade if the conditions aren't favorable. We've had a big rally in tech with Increasing Implied Volatility - which isn't the norm. We've had people bidding up names that split (AAPL, TSLA), with no change to the underlying fundamentals. Other than the few shares of AAPL I'll buy for my long term account, I'm going to sit out on AAPL options trades for a little while until the name stabilizes or the vol conditions become more favorable. There are plenty of other good opportunities in the market in the meantime.

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",2020-08-28,1761,723

That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. 

Is GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  
Here's my thinking:

* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem
* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).
* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.

hmheb0_AAPL,AAPL,$AAPL - iOS14 changes could cut app ad monetization by 50%,"When Apple rolls out iOS14 (likely in September), any app/developer who wants access to the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for an Apple device will need to get user consent again. (IDFA is currently used by advertisers to track users across apps/websites).

That consent is stored and only reset if user uninstall/reinstall the app, so the app can't just keep prompting for user for consent over and over. Also, AAPL will control the language/presentation of the consent prompt, although developers should still have some options around how to minimize opt-outs (e.g. degrading app experience until user accepts tracking).

According to a research report by D. A. Davidson, this change is not completely unexpected. A poll by Ad Profs (an independent ad tech consultancy) in Sep 2019 suggests \~80% of those surveyed had expected some major change to IDFA within a year. They estimate 1/2 of iOS users will upgrade to iOS14 within a few weeks of rollout, and above 90% of users will have upgraded by Q1 of 2021.

Ad Profs also estimate the iOS14 upgrade will result in \~50% cut to app ad monetization. They believe AAPL is secretly pushing App developers to encourage users who opt-out to pay for the app via in-app purchases because AAPL gets a 30% cut from those payments.",2020-07-06,161,42

h84xbi_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL the compounder,"I was taking a closer look at AAPL, the $1.4 trillion market cap behemoth.

The business definitely qualifies as one with a wide moat as it consistently generates high ROIC and impressive margins. 

NOPAT and FCF growth has been consistent too, at around 5% CAGR in the last five years. 

The wide moat gives us confidence that AAPL is very likely to be able to generate this same CAGR in earnings going forward for the next decade.

However, buying it at 25x earnings today and exiting at the same 25x merely gives 5% CAGR. 

A consistent 5% CAGR over a decade is not shabby but not exciting and could be below the cost of capital for some investors. 

Am I missing something? Should we expect AAPL’s earnings to accelerate (and therefore perhaps have higher exit multiple too)? Or am I under-estimating the compounding rate of AAPL such that attributing 5% is too low?

In comparison, Berkshire bought into the company around 2016. Back then, Apple was compounding NOPAT and FCF at a similar 5% CAGR, with equally high ROIC. However, the PE was much lower at around 10 - 15x.

until expiration, I believe a 210-225 strike in Jan 2020-2021 could be heavily favorable with low theta decay for the time being. Even though a bit OTM at this point, I dont think surpassing the ATH is impossible even with all of these tarriffs
on both ends. Adittionally Apple will maybe see a
10% increase in product prices to help balance
the icome statements long term, thus allowing for
similar projections. 

Are there any opinions on this? I still have Jul19 215c, so i expect a small rebound soon even though this huge dip. I’m looking to
mitigate risk by lowering the chance of theta decay.

Could a person with better understanding of my
plan give your HONEST opinion of this theory? At most Id risk a few thousand, and could acquire quite a few contracts around 230-245 strikes on far out expiry. I believe should apple return and break through their ATH of about $220 would see a hard breakout closer to 230, and even if it happened after 6 months from today, they would see at least 100% gains on each contract, prospectively. 

Can a more experienced trader help me clarify risk vs. reward, with a serious reply only. I feel this is solid given the far out expiries. Time is on my side, especially if they offset their tariffs, and should a deal be reached in the next 6-9 months, we could see
huge gains in underlying share price, to surpass the recent 215.

I currently hold 7/19 215$ AAPL Calls. Down 80% since tariff raise. Opinions? Express
please with supporting or countering viewpoints.

* * *

Shortly after Apple slashed its revenue guidance for the first quarter, Goldman Sachs said the iPhone maker will likely have to bring down numbers for the full year. As those results drop further, so will the company's shares, the firm said.

""We see the potential for further downside to FY19 numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019,"" wrote Goldman's Rod Hall in a note to clients late Wednesday.

The company sees first-quarter revenue of $84 billion vs. a previous guidance of a range of $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $91.3 billion for the period, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet. Apple blamed most of the revenue shortfall on a slowing economy in China in the second half.

Apple shares dropped more than 9 percent to $143.70 in premarket trading after ending the first day of 2019 at $157.92. And Goldman's Hall slashed his 12-month forecast to $140 from $182. He also lowered his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and his full-year EPS estimate by 10 percent to $11.66.

Nokia comparison
""We have been flagging China demand issues since late September and Apple's guidance cut confirms our view,"" wrote Hall. ""We do not expect the situation to get better in March and would remain cautious on the region.""

But the analyst went further, comparing Apple to the fallen phone maker Nokia, which became reliant on customer upgrades in the face of a saturated market more than a decade ago. Customers delayed replacing their phones for longer and longer as economy slowed, Goldman notes.

""Nokia saw rapid nexpansion of replacement rates in late 2007 that was well beyond what any linear forecast would have implied,"" wrote Hall. ""Beyond China, we don't see strong evidence of a consumer slowdown heading into 2019 but we just flag to investors that we believe Apple's replacement rates are likely much more sensitive to the macro now that the company is approaching maximum market penetration for the iPhone.""

Goldman got to its new price target by applying just a 12 multiple to the firm's new earnings estimate. Its previous price-earnings ratio was 13.6.",2019-01-03,1508,505

&#x200B;

Watching AAPL drop 25% over the past month had me thinking it was now ""cheap"" and a good deal to start buying but according to this PE [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/RgmmL37) it's stock price to earnings is still near 2-year highs and appears to be above average over the past 8-9 years.   So relative to itself, AAPL does not appear cheap here.  



So then I started thinking, maybe AAPL is cheap relative to the index (Nasdaq) in this case.  Here is a 10 year chart showing AAPL's share price is still up 100% relative the Nasdaq.  [Chart Link](https://imgur.com/a/uO5Ayeh)   Again, AAPL does not yet look cheap.  

&#x200B;

Finally I thought maybe AAPL's PE at around 14 is ""cheap"" relative to all market PEs over the past 30 years.  This [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/RzgqUCU) shows AAPL's PE (red x) relative to S&P500 historic PEs over the past 30 years.   So here AAPL is actually start to look like a good buy as investors are paying less per earnings relative to the market average.  

&#x200B;

To me the first two charts show AAPL as being at least fair or average priced right now relative to itself and the last chart shows it to be at a discount relative to the rest of the market.      Am I doing this right or can anyone offer some insight here.  

  
Thanks.

I have just turned 18, and as my first investment in the stock market, I bought two shares of Apple (AAPL) for $171.94. Tell me what you think of my analysis and if you agree with my first picks. If you’re interested in my progress, feel free to check out my blog, on my road to being a billionaire! 
 

Despite this being a cyclical blue chip stock; I have had a long hard think about it, and have some theories as to why it will be a lucrative pick.



1. It’s pretty damn cheap

With a P/E ratio of 17 and net profits in excess of $48bn, you don’t need me to say financially it isn’t a top company. And before you slate me, I know this is slightly cheaper than normal due to the recent tax reform – still pretty good though. As well as this, it is expected that the 1.46% dividend yield is going to increase over the coming years following the release of their crazy-high free cash flow levels.


2. They own a surprisingly small share of the PC market

As of this year, Apple own a measly 7% of the personal computer market. Far behind HP and co. Though, just last week a Bloomberg report announced that they will be making their own computer chips from 2020 – this report alone caused Intel to plummet 9%. And with another Macbook Pro likely to be released next year, I can see Apple’s PC market share growing drastically over the next few years.

 

3. The Video Streaming Industry

With Netflix struggling to make a profit, despite their huge subscription increases, the door appears to be wide open for a company like Google, Amazon or Apple to take the lead in the video streaming industry. Apple have more free cash flow than just about anyone in the industry so they have the funds to blow Netflix out of the water. Whether this will be done, is yet to be seen. But it certainly isn’t impossible.


Overall, I’m very pleased to be an owner of Apple. It is an industry I relatively understand, with a company I have massive faith in, at a cheap price. What’s not to like.",2018-04-12,0,10

1hpusa_AAPL,AAPL,AAPL down on an Up day off Samsung Warning,"Samsung issued an Earnings Warning due to selling less than expected flagship Galaxy S4 phones.

The overall stock market was up today, closing at Week highs, with the SP500 at approx 1632 (and bullishly over its 50dma for the first time all week).

AAPL however, opened flat at 422.50 (Wed's high); and went down all day before end of day bounce at 415, to close at 417 -4.

1) one can say this Samsung news is bullish for AAPL, in that the Galaxy S4 uptake while very high, is less than expected. Thus some might argue this is AAPL bullish.

2) others may say this is AAPL bearish as we perhaps this just means we are seeing a global slowdown in people buying every smartphone that comes out, as there is not that much real change today. Whereas in prior years, there was a tangible difference. People wanted the new one, whereas now, people seem happy with using a smartphone 2-3 years old and are not rushing to buy the new one. (from either Samsung or AAPL).

3) lol - BBRY clearly is not winning new business given their tankage of over 25% share price.

My own personal read is that now that late spring/summer is here : 
people will put any buying decision on hold until AAPL demos iPhone5s very shortly (rumor has it on sale Sep 20). 

IF iPhone5s has some amazing new must-have feature, or IF they finally make a larger screen size : that may be AAPL bullish, I don't know yet. but IF they do not make a bigger screen; and 5s is just a minor refresh of iPhone5; that will certainly be very AAPL bearish (imo).

Disclaimer: Net short AAPL for long time, was long earlier this week off the DipBuying at 400 off the iWatch Trademark Monday news. Closed said long (posted) at 421s, indicating my thoughts that 420-425 will now be major resistance. (thus little trade also of weekly credit call spread at 425 skew). When this was written (friday evening), simply Net Short via Jan 2014 Credit spread. (in other words, I'm still long term bearish)
