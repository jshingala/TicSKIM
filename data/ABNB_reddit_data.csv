1kcietw_GOOGL,GOOGL,Airbnb issues disappointing revenue guidance for second quarter,"Airbnb reported results for the first quarter that were mostly in line with estimates, but the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the current period.

Shares declined about 4%.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 24 cents per share vs. 24 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.27 billion vs. $2.26 billion estimate.

Revenue increased 6% from about $2.1 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $154 million, or 24 cents per share, from $264 million, or 41 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.

For the second quarter, Airbnb said it expects revenue of between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range. Analysts had forecast $3.04 billion in revenue for the current period. The company said it expects the period to include a two percentage point benefit due to Easter timing.

“In the U.S., we’ve seen relatively softer results, which we believe has been largely driven by broader economic uncertainties,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.

While the company said it experienced strong year-over-year growth in North America “despite broad macro uncertainty,” it reported “softness” in travel from Canada to the U.S. toward the end of the quarter.

Tariffs are the story of this earnings season, as investors look for signs that President Donald Trump’s sweeping levies on imports are weighing on costs and consumer spending.

Gross booking value, which measures host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, increased 7% year over year to $24.5 billion, in line with estimates. Night and experiences booked rose 8% from a year ago and totaled 143.1 million, compared to the 143.4 million estimate from analysts.

Excluding North America, Airbnb said that nights and experiences grew 11% from a year ago. Nights booked by Canadian guests visiting Mexico jumped 27% from a year ago in March. The company said it expects nights and experiences booked to “moderate” in the current period from the first quarter.

“During April, we saw strong demand for Easter travel from Latin America–which remains our fastest growing region,” Airbnb said.

Airbnb also teased new updates to its app coming later this month that will go “beyond places to stay.” The company said it has removed 450,000 listing since updating its host quality system in 2023.

[PatchTogether Investing](https://substack.com/@patchtogether)

One of the more underappreciated elements of Airbnb’s business model is how it approaches marketing. While many investors instinctively treat all marketing expenses as costs that must be fully deducted in the current period, Airbnb’s management has offered a subtle but important clue: a large portion of its marketing budget is actually an investment in long-term brand equity and future growth.

In Airbnb’s own words:

“The majority of the spend is on brand marketing. And the way to think about brand marketing is that it is effectively a fixed amount of spend for each market in terms of the minimum amount that you need to spend for that market to be efficient... it is not necessarily a one-for-one like performance marketing.”

This statement reveals two key insights:

1. **Brand marketing dominates the spend** — Airbnb prioritizes long-term awareness over short-term, performance-driven advertising.
2. **Brand spend behaves more like capex than opex** — it doesn't scale with revenue but acts as a fixed investment that compounds in value over time.

# Marketing Spend Breakdown

In 2024, Airbnb spent **$2.15 billion** on sales and marketing. Based on management commentary and historical behavior, we estimate:

* **70%** of that spend ($1.50 billion) was brand marketing
* **30%** ($645 million) was performance marketing

# Adjusting for Owner Earnings

If you're calculating Airbnb’s owner earnings or true free cash flow, the brand marketing spend should be treated as a capital investment, not a period expense. Using a simple 3-year straight-line amortization:

* **Brand marketing ($1.5B)** amortized = $500 million/year
* Therefore, add back **$1.0 billion** to free cash flow in 2024

# Applying the Same Lens to Product Development

Management has also made it clear that product development is growth-oriented:

“We've rebuilt our platform from the ground up with a new technology stack... this sets us up well to now turn our product roadmap toward supporting new services.”

“We made over 500 upgrades to our platform... introduced major features like Guest Favorites, flexible payments, enhanced search and checkout, and rebuilt our messaging and listing management systems.”

This is not just maintenance—it’s building a long-term product platform.

In 2024, Airbnb spent **$2.056 billion** on product development. A conservative estimate would be to treat **50%** of this ($1.0 billion) as a capital-like investment. Amortized over 3 years:

* $333 million/year expensed
* Add back the remaining **$667 million** to free cash flow

# Total Adjustment

Combining both marketing and product development:

* Add back: $1.0B (brand marketing) + $667M (product development) = **$1.67 billion** 

# Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Starting from reported free cash flow:

* **Reported cash from operation (2024):** $4,518 million
* **Less stock-based compensation:** \-$1,407 million
* **Add back adjusted capex-like investments:** \+$1,667 million **Adjusted FCF = $4,778 million**

At today’s market cap, after subtracting Airbnb’s **$8.62 billion net cash**, the business trades at roughly **15.2x adjusted FCF**, which is quite attractive for a high-margin, capital-light platform with meaningful runway ahead.

# Future Growth Potential

In addition to the adjusted financials, there are several underappreciated growth drivers:

# 1. Advertising (High Margin Optionality)

From the latest earnings call:

“We definitely think this is easily a $1 billion revenue opportunity. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.”

While not in the 2025 plan, advertising represents a meaningful upside lever Airbnb hasn’t even touched yet.

# 2. International Expansion

Airbnb’s revenue is still concentrated in a few core markets:

“Our business is concentrated in our top 5 core markets — the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, and Australia — which comprise about 70% of our gross booking value.”

This leaves a wide runway for growth in markets like Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, where Airbnb is still underpenetrated.

# 3. New Product Adjacencies

Airbnb is thinking beyond accommodations:

“There are dozens and dozens... if you got really granular, hundreds of opportunities… like 17–18% of our nights booked are already for stays longer than 30 days.”

As more users live and work remotely, Airbnb is positioned to expand into adjacent services like co-hosting, concierge support, or even lifestyle-oriented subscriptions.

# 4. Higher Engagement

The goal is not just to grow bookings—but to increase frequency:

“We want the Airbnb app to be used not just once or twice a year, but once or twice a week.”

This means more frequent interactions, broader offerings, and deeper customer relationships—creating a stronger ecosystem over time.

# Wall Street Heads South, NYSE Expands to Texas

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is launching NYSE Texas, reincorporating its Chicago operations into a fully electronic exchange in Dallas. With $3.7 trillion in market value already represented by Texas-based NYSE listings, the state is becoming a major player in corporate America’s future. The move signals a deeper shift in the financial world, as firms seek a business-friendly environment with lower taxes and lighter regulations.

**A Texas-Sized Showdown**

NYSE Texas enters the ring against the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), an upstart backed by BlackRock and Citadel, set to start trading in 2026. TXSE has marketed itself as an antidote to Wall Street’s ESG-focused regulations, attracting firms eager to avoid political and social investment mandates. With $161 million already raised and regulatory filings in motion, TXSE is positioning itself as a serious competitor.

**Texas’ Bigger Bet: More Than Just Exchanges**

The finance migration to Texas isn’t stopping at stock markets. Tesla and SpaceX reincorporated in the state last year, and reports suggest Meta is considering a similar move. The influx of financial powerhouses has led to a booming infrastructure expansion, with firms like Goldman Sachs building a Dallas campus for 5,000 employees. Texas is also working to rival Delaware as a corporate legal hub, creating a specialized business court to attract more companies.

**NYSE vs. TXSE: Who Wins?**

The battle for Texas’ financial crown is heating up. While NYSE Texas carries Wall Street’s most prestigious brand, TXSE has the backing of powerful financial firms. Nasdaq is also watching closely, having already reorganized its listings business to account for Texas’ growing market. With multiple exchanges vying for dominance, Texas could soon become one of the country’s biggest financial hubs.

# Echelon Of Earnings From Coinbase, AppLovin, Airbnb

**Coinbase Surges as Digital Currency Trading Booms Post-Election**

Coinbase jumped 8.44% after delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings, thanks to a 179% spike in consumer transaction revenue as retail investors flocked back post-election. The digital currency exchange pulled in $2.27 billion in revenue, smashing estimates of $1.87 billion, while net income soared to $1.29 billion, or $4.68 per share, beating forecasts. Management called this the “dawn of a new era for c r y p t o,” and with subscription and services revenue expected to hit up to $765 million in Q1, Coinbase isn’t just along for the ride—it’s in the driver’s seat.

Management sees Q1 revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion, well above the $1.32 billion forecast. CEO Adam Foroughi put it bluntly: “We’ve never been a game developer at heart.” Wall Street, apparently, agrees. ($APP)

**Airbnb Books Strong Q4, But Revenue Guidance Disappoints**

Airbnb climbed 14.22% after-hours riding a strong holiday travel wave, with APAC and Latin America leading growth.

But investors flinched at Airbnb’s Q1 revenue forecast of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion, slightly below the $2.29 billion consensus. To keep the momentum going, the company is dropping $250 million into new products, including travel experiences and in-home services. Looks like Airbnb is hoping to be more than just your go-to vacation rental. ($ABNB)

The influx of financial powerhouses has led to a booming infrastructure expansion, with firms like Goldman Sachs building a Dallas campus for 5,000 employees. Texas is also working to rival Delaware as a corporate legal hub, creating a specialized business court to attract more companies.

**NYSE vs. TXSE: Who Wins?**

The battle for Texas’ financial crown is heating up. While NYSE Texas carries Wall Street’s most prestigious brand, TXSE has the backing of powerful financial firms. Nasdaq is also watching closely, having already reorganized its listings business to account for Texas’ growing market. With multiple exchanges vying for dominance, Texas could soon become one of the country’s biggest financial hubs.

# Echelon Of Earnings From Coinbase, AppLovin, Airbnb

**Coinbase Surges as Digital Currency Trading Booms Post-Election**

Coinbase jumped 8.44% after delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings, thanks to a 179% spike in consumer transaction revenue as retail investors flocked back post-election. The digital currency exchange pulled in $2.27 billion in revenue, smashing estimates of $1.87 billion, while net income soared to $1.29 billion, or $4.68 per share, beating forecasts. Management called this the “dawn of a new era for c r y p t o,” and with subscription and services revenue expected to hit up to $765 million in Q1, Coinbase isn’t just along for the ride—it’s in the driver’s seat.

**AppLovin Cashes Out on Gaming, Doubles Down on AI Ads**

AppLovin soared 24.02% after announcing it’s offloading its mobile gaming business for $900 million to focus on its AI-powered ad software. The ad tech company crushed Q4 expectations with 44% revenue growth, fueled by a 73% spike in ad sales. Management sees Q1 revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion, well above the $1.32 billion forecast. CEO Adam Foroughi put it bluntly: “We’ve never been a game developer at heart.” Wall Street, apparently, agrees. ($APP)

**Airbnb Books Strong Q4, But Revenue Guidance Disappoints**

Airbnb climbed 14.22% after-hours riding a strong holiday travel wave, with APAC and Latin America leading growth. Q4 revenue landed at $2.27 billion, just edging past expectations, and adjusted earnings beat estimates too. But investors flinched at Airbnb’s Q1 revenue forecast of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion, slightly below the $2.29 billion consensus. To keep the momentum going, the company is dropping $250 million into new products, including travel experiences and in-home services. Looks like Airbnb is hoping to be more than just your go-to vacation rental. ($ABNB)

# Wall Street Heads South, NYSE Expands to Texas

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is launching NYSE Texas, reincorporating its Chicago operations into a fully electronic exchange in Dallas. With $3.7 trillion in market value already represented by Texas-based NYSE listings, the state is becoming a major player in corporate America’s future. The move signals a deeper shift in the financial world, as firms seek a business-friendly environment with lower taxes and lighter regulations.

**A Texas-Sized Showdown**

NYSE Texas enters the ring against the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), an upstart backed by BlackRock and Citadel, set to start trading in 2026. TXSE has marketed itself as an antidote to Wall Street’s ESG-focused regulations, attracting firms eager to avoid political and social investment mandates. With $161 million already raised and regulatory filings in motion, TXSE is positioning itself as a serious competitor.

AppLovin soared 24.02% after announcing it’s offloading its mobile gaming business for $900 million to focus on its AI-powered ad software. The ad tech company crushed Q4 expectations with 44% revenue growth, fueled by a 73% spike in ad sales. Management sees Q1 revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion, well above the $1.32 billion forecast. CEO Adam Foroughi put it bluntly: “We’ve never been a game developer at heart.” Wall Street, apparently, agrees. ($APP)

**Airbnb Books Strong Q4, But Revenue Guidance Disappoints**

Airbnb climbed 14.22% after-hours riding a strong holiday travel wave, with APAC and Latin America leading growth. Q4 revenue landed at $2.27 billion, just edging past expectations, and adjusted earnings beat estimates too. But investors flinched at Airbnb’s Q1 revenue forecast of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion, slightly below the $2.29 billion consensus. To keep the momentum going, the company is dropping $250 million into new products, including travel experiences and in-home services. Looks like Airbnb is hoping to be more than just your go-to vacation rental. ($ABNB)

# Wall Street Heads South, NYSE Expands to Texas

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is launching NYSE Texas, reincorporating its Chicago operations into a fully electronic exchange in Dallas. With $3.7 trillion in market value already represented by Texas-based NYSE listings, the state is becoming a major player in corporate America’s future. The move signals a deeper shift in the financial world, as firms seek a business-friendly environment with lower taxes and lighter regulations.

**A Texas-Sized Showdown**

NYSE Texas enters the ring against the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), an upstart backed by BlackRock and Citadel, set to start trading in 2026. TXSE has marketed itself as an antidote to Wall Street’s ESG-focused regulations, attracting firms eager to avoid political and social investment mandates. With $161 million already raised and regulatory filings in motion, TXSE is positioning itself as a serious competitor.

**Texas’ Bigger Bet: More Than Just Exchanges**

The finance migration to Texas isn’t stopping at stock markets. Tesla and SpaceX reincorporated in the state last year, and reports suggest Meta is considering a similar move. The influx of financial powerhouses has led to a booming infrastructure expansion, with firms like Goldman Sachs building a Dallas campus for 5,000 employees. Texas is also working to rival Delaware as a corporate legal hub, creating a specialized business court to attract more companies.

**NYSE vs. TXSE: Who Wins?**

The battle for Texas’ financial crown is heating up. While NYSE Texas carries Wall Street’s most prestigious brand, TXSE has the backing of powerful financial firms. Nasdaq is also watching closely, having already reorganized its listings business to account for Texas’ growing market. With multiple exchanges vying for dominance, Texas could soon become one of the country’s biggest financial hubs.

1ip2deq_ABNB,ABNB,Airbnb shares pop 15% on better-than-expected earnings and revenue,"Airbnb shares jumped 15% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.

Here’s how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 73 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.48 billion vs. $2.42 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from $2.22 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb reported net income of $461 million, or 73 cents per share. A year ago, Airbnb reported a loss of $349 million, or a loss of 55 cents per share.

In the first quarter, Airbnb expects to report revenue between $2.23 billion and $2.27 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.3 billion for the period, according to LSEG. Airbnb said its first quarter of 2024 benefited from both Easter and an extra day in February.

Airbnb also said adjusted profit for the fourth quarter was $765 million, up 4% year over year. Analysts were expecting $653.5 million, according to StreetAccount.

In a letter to shareholders, the company said it has rebuilt its technology stack and rolled out new product updates in recent years that are driving higher conversion rates. The company also teased new offerings that it will launch in May, though it did not disclose additional details. 

“Airbnb is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was several years ago,” the letter said. “We’re continuing to build on this momentum in 2025, executing a multi-year strategy to perfect the core service, accelerate growth in global markets, and launch and scale new offerings.”

The company reported 111 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago and above the 108.7 million expected by StreetAccount. Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That is above the $17.2 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said Airbnb.org, a nonprofit founded by the company, has housed more than 19,000 people and 2,300 pets following the devastating wildfires that broke out in Los Angeles last month. The nonprofit has pledged to offer 100,000 free nights and has received $27 million in donations, including $18 million from Airbnb and its founders.

The company said it has more than five million hosts and eight million active listings around the world. Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $158 in the fourth quarter, the company said.

Airbnb shares were up about 7% for the year before Thursday’s report, topping the Nasdaq, which has gained more than 3%.

Reasoning? Mostly “Trust me bro” but here are my regard thoughts.

WYNN - I went to Vegas in Nov & Dec for Thanksgiving and NYE. Wynn/Encore were D-E-A-D both times. Wynn is only up now because MGM beat. But MGM resorts were packed and they have MGMBet. Also lots of reports that Vegas attendance struggled mightily during the Super Bowl, which will hurt guidance.

ABNB - I have a friend who works for them. They are struggling. Creating themed AirBNB shit just to get people to attend houses. Also hearing a lot of rich fucks in skiing areas of the country really struggled to rent out their places for tourists.

But I could whiff on both. So tread lightly. This is mostly just gut and wanted to share. Cheers and let the roasting begin.",2025-02-13,12,42

# TikTok’s Fate Rests on Trump After Supreme Court Upholds Law

The Supreme Court has spoken: TikTok’s U.S. operations are officially on the chopping block unless ByteDance divests ownership by Sunday. The verdict sends shockwaves through the digital sphere, with TikTok's 170 million American users now scrambling for alternatives—and rival platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat hoping to cash in.

But wait, it’s complicated. Incoming President Trump, a known TikTok fan (go figure), might throw a lifeline. Rumors swirl of an executive order delaying the ban, while ByteDance plays hardball, showing no interest in selling the platform.

**Winners, Losers, and... RedNote?**

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

**Hotels Are Winning—for Now**

Since the crackdown, average NYC hotel rates have hit $417/night—a record high. Meanwhile, Airbnb argues the restrictions aren’t solving the housing crisis, pointing to rising rents and fewer affordable travel options.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

**Hotels Are Winning—for Now**

Since the crackdown, average NYC hotel rates have hit $417/night—a record high. Meanwhile, Airbnb argues the restrictions aren’t solving the housing crisis, pointing to rising rents and fewer affordable travel options.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

# TikTok’s Fate Rests on Trump After Supreme Court Upholds Law

The Supreme Court has spoken: TikTok’s U.S. operations are officially on the chopping block unless ByteDance divests ownership by Sunday. The verdict sends shockwaves through the digital sphere, with TikTok's 170 million American users now scrambling for alternatives—and rival platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat hoping to cash in.

But wait, it’s complicated. Incoming President Trump, a known TikTok fan (go figure), might throw a lifeline. Rumors swirl of an executive order delaying the ban, while ByteDance plays hardball, showing no interest in selling the platform.

**Winners, Losers, and... RedNote?**

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

# TikTok’s Fate Rests on Trump After Supreme Court Upholds Law

The Supreme Court has spoken: TikTok’s U.S. operations are officially on the chopping block unless ByteDance divests ownership by Sunday. The verdict sends shockwaves through the digital sphere, with TikTok's 170 million American users now scrambling for alternatives—and rival platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat hoping to cash in.

But wait, it’s complicated. Incoming President Trump, a known TikTok fan (go figure), might throw a lifeline. Rumors swirl of an executive order delaying the ban, while ByteDance plays hardball, showing no interest in selling the platform.

**Winners, Losers, and... RedNote?**

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

# TikTok’s Fate Rests on Trump After Supreme Court Upholds Law

The Supreme Court has spoken: TikTok’s U.S. operations are officially on the chopping block unless ByteDance divests ownership by Sunday. The verdict sends shockwaves through the digital sphere, with TikTok's 170 million American users now scrambling for alternatives—and rival platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat hoping to cash in.

But wait, it’s complicated. Incoming President Trump, a known TikTok fan (go figure), might throw a lifeline. Rumors swirl of an executive order delaying the ban, while ByteDance plays hardball, showing no interest in selling the platform.

**Winners, Losers, and... RedNote?**

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

**Hotels Are Winning—for Now**

Since the crackdown, average NYC hotel rates have hit $417/night—a record high. Meanwhile, Airbnb argues the restrictions aren’t solving the housing crisis, pointing to rising rents and fewer affordable travel options.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

**Hotels Are Winning—for Now**

Since the crackdown, average NYC hotel rates have hit $417/night—a record high. Meanwhile, Airbnb argues the restrictions aren’t solving the housing crisis, pointing to rising rents and fewer affordable travel options.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

1gm1b2f_ABNB,ABNB,Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

1elx32s_NET,NET,Airbnb shares drop 14% on earnings miss as company warns of slowing U.S. demand,"# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings per share:** 86 cents vs. 92 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.75 billion vs. $2.74 billion expected
* **Net income:** $555 million (down 15% YoY)
* **Nights and Experiences booked:** 125.1 million (highest Q2 result)

Airbnb shares took a 14% nosedive in after-hours trading after the company reported second-quarter earnings that didn’t quite hit the mark. Despite a modest revenue increase of 11% year-over-year, Airbnb warned of storm clouds on the horizon, specifically pointing to signs of slowing demand from U.S. customers and shorter booking lead times globally.

The vacation rental giant did manage to post its highest-ever Q2 result in its “Nights and Experiences” category, with 125.1 million bookings. But the company is tempering expectations for the third quarter, guiding revenue between $3.67 billion and $3.73 billion and signaling that growth in its key categories might moderate.

In a letter to shareholders, Airbnb also highlighted its efforts to boost quality by removing over 200,000 low-quality listings since launching its “quality system” last year. As investors keep a close eye on consumer behavior, concerns are mounting, especially with the Federal Reserve holding off on rate cuts. Other companies, like McDonald’s, have already hinted at economic pressure, noting that customers are starting to feel the squeeze.

I did read that 2023 had income tax benefits for Airbnb that inflated the P/E somehow. I don't know how that works. 

I've also read some alarming things about the current housing market and I'm not sure how that would affect Airbnb's business.

1dzf3pp_ABNB,ABNB,$ABNB and $EXPE are Facing Cities Around World Cracking Down on Short-Term Rentals.,"*Cities Are Cracking Down on Short-Term Rentals. Here’s How.*

> “Cities around the world are imposing stricter rules for short-term rentals offered as vacation properties by the likes of Airbnb and Vrbo. Short-term bookings, often defined as stays shorter than a month, reduce the supply of long-term rentals in local markets and are frequently blamed for exacerbating housing shortages, inflating rents and threatening hospitality jobs.”

> “Many city governments see short-term rentals as an obstacle to affordable housing. When a large swath of the local housing supply is carved out for tourists, there’s less inventory for full-time residents. The New York City comptroller’s office found that roughly 9.2% of the rent increases imposed by landlords from 2009 to 2016 were attributable to the effect of Airbnb alone.”

> “Vancouver, one of the latest cities to place limits on short-term rentals, offers an example. Last year, full-home Airbnb listings there earned an average of C$222 (US$163) per night, according to data from short-term rental watchdog Inside Airbnb, while long-term rentals brought in about C$99 per night. So it would take only 15 days of short-term rentals to exceed a full month’s rent in a long-term lease.”

> “In Barcelona, which has more than 10,000 vacation-property listings registered with the city, rents have soared 68% in the last decade, in part because high interest rates are pushing more would-be homeowners into the rental market and also because of reduced rental inventory.”

*What kinds of regulations are cities imposing?*

- Principal residence requirement:

- Vancouver, Canada: 

   - Requires short-term rentals to be listed only for primary residences, aiming to preserve housing availability.

- Santa Monica, California: 

   - Permits “home shares” where homeowners must reside during rentals, distinguishing them from vacation rentals to maintain residential integrity.

- Maximum number of listings:

- Seattle, Washington: 

   - Allows owners to list their primary residence and one additional unit in a secondary investment property for short-term rentals, balancing economic opportunities with housing concerns.

- Nights per year maximum:

- London, Vienna, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.: 

   - Impose a cap of 90 nights per year on short-term rentals to manage tourist impact and maintain residential stability.

- Paris, France: 

   - Sets a maximum of 120 nights per year for short-term rentals to regulate the tourism impact on housing availability.

- Consecutive nights minimum:

- Honolulu, Hawaii: 

   - Requires a minimum stay of 90 consecutive days for short-term rentals, discouraging short-term occupancy and promoting longer-term residency.

- Singapore: 

   - Implements a minimum booking period of half a year (approximately 180 days) for short-term rentals to manage housing availability and community impact.

- “Whitelist” neighborhoods:

- Montreal, Canada: 

   - Enforces varied regulations across different neighborhoods; some completely ban short-term rentals while others restrict them to principal residences or allow them without such restrictions, aiming to balance economic benefits with local community concerns.

*Are the regulations working?*

> The effectiveness of short-term rental regulations often hinges on robust enforcement mechanisms and data-sharing agreements between cities and booking platforms.

> For instance, New York City's stringent host registration process in September 2023 led to a significant reduction in Airbnb listings by 89%, emphasizing the impact of enforcement on compliance. 

> Meanwhile, the hotel industry in cities like New York has seen increased occupancy and higher rates as tourists seek alternatives due to stricter regulations. 

> Conversely, Berlin initially struggled to enforce a ban on short-term rentals in 2016, facing challenges from defiant hosts and eventually relaxing restrictions to allow primary residences to be rented indefinitely and second homes for up to 90 days annually.

*How are cities overcoming the difficulty with enforcing regulations?*

> “Denmark’s policy allows hosts to rent out their entire homes for 30 nights per year as a baseline. However, the cap rises to 70 nights if the rental is booked through any platform that shares booking logs and host revenue data with the government. Officials say it’s a win for everyone — platforms get more bookings, hosts earn more income, and the government knows how much tax to charge hosts.”

> “Japan’s data-sharing agreement with rental platforms allows the country to enforce its 180-night cap. And earlier this year, the European Union presented a blanket policy that will require booking platforms to share host activity data with all member states starting in 2026.”

*What do the platforms say?* 

> The landscape of short-term rental regulation is evolving with platforms like Airbnb increasingly embracing cooperation with cities to manage the impact of their services. 

> Airbnb, through its updated City Portal, facilitates data-sharing and enforcement of local laws, signaling a proactive stance towards addressing housing affordability concerns. 

> In contrast, Vrbo, TripAdvisor, and Booking.com have not disclosed their approaches to working with municipalities, highlighting potential differences in transparency and engagement.

1co1zd6_ABNB,ABNB,"Airbnb's Q1 2024 Earnings Breakdown: Strong Organic Growth, Stable ADRs, and Strategic AI Integration","Airbnb ($ABNB) recently hosted their Q1 2024 earnings call, revealing several critical insights into their strategic operations and financial health. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the key points discussed:

**Organic Growth**: Airbnb reported significant organic growth in app downloads, primarily driven by optimization efforts rather than paid advertising. This has led to improved conversion rates, outperforming their mobile website.

**Supply vs. Demand**: The platform has achieved a 70% net quality growth in its supply, aligning closely with the increase in nights booked. This alignment indicates a robust ability to match supply with rising demand.

**Average Daily Rate (ADR) Stability**: Despite various market conditions, Airbnb has managed to maintain stable ADRs, focusing on enhancing consumer value and experience.

**Marketing ROI**: Performance marketing channels have yielded high ROI, supported by ongoing testing and improvements in audience targeting and landing pages. Notably, the company remains resilient against changes such as the Digital Markets Act in Europe and alterations in Google search algorithms, thanks to its strong base of direct and unpaid traffic sources.

**Policy and Quality Control**: Changes in the extenuating circumstances policy were noted, along with a push towards quality control and host education. Airbnb is committed to elevating listing quality and host performance through targeted coaching.

**Expansion Initiatives**: The company is refreshing its product offerings, particularly in Asia, to enhance user experiences. Moreover, Airbnb is expanding its business scope beyond just accommodations, aiming to transform into a multi-vertical platform.

**Financial Adjustments**: The earnings call briefly mentioned financial adjustments including a one-off payment processing issue from the previous year. A shift in the timing of marketing expenditures will likely lead to an increase in marketing spend as a percentage of revenue in Q2.

**AI Integration**: Airbnb is keen on integrating AI technology into their services. Initially focusing on customer service improvements, the company plans to develop this into a full-fledged AI-powered concierge service.

**Analyst Q&A Session:** When being asked about the trade-off between removing low-quality listings and the potential impact on bookings, CEO Brian Chesky believes that the removal of low-quality listings hasn't impacted global bookings, as they weren't getting many bookings or were leading to customer service contacts. Furthermore, many hosts are coachable and can learn from feedback, and the company is seeing good hosts rewarded and expanding their business.

1aq5fl9_ABNB,ABNB,Airbnb reports better-than-expected revenue and beats on guidance,"Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter on Tuesday and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period. The stock jumped more than 8% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did:

EPS: 55-cent loss. It’s not immediately clear if that’s comparable to the 62-cent profit estimate, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

Revenue: $2.22 billion vs. $2.17 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG

Revenue climbed 17% from $1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Airbnb posted adjusted earnings of $738 million in the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $645 million, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb reported a net loss of $349 million, or 55 cents a share, compared to net income of $319 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said its loss included lodging tax reserves and non-recurring tax withholding expenses of around $1 billion.

In its shareholder letter, Airbnb said the company is at an “inflection point” after spending the last three years upgrading and adding features to its main room-sharing service. Airbnb said it’s investing in more under-penetrated markets abroad in 2024, and that it will share plans to expand beyond its core business later this year.

Airbnb said revenue in the first quarter will be between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, while Wall Street was expecting $2.03 billion, according to LSEG. The company said the quarter started out strong, with more than 6 million guests celebrating the new year in an Airbnb.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, came in at $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 98.8 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago, and above the 98 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb said guest demand “remains strong,” particularly for first-time users. The company said that after the “volatility” impacted the business in October, when the Israel-Hamas war broke out, its nights booked growth accelerated through the rest of the period.

Average daily rates increased by 3% from a year ago to $157 in the fourth quarter, and the company ended 2023 with 7.7 million active listings, up 18% from a year earlier.

Airbnb said in the investor letter that it has seen “double-digit supply growth” in active listings across every region, while the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions grew the most.

The company expects to report a small-ish uptick in their Nights and Experiences (nights) booked from the second quarter’s 115.1 million. hey're also projecting a record-smashing 3Q adjusted EBITDA (that's basically their earnings before the suits take out taxes and other boring stuff), which was a sweet $1.5 billion last year. They're also hoping to improve on their EBITDA margin of 51% from 2022.

Third-party data suggests strong 3Q bookings.

Analysts at the Bank of America (BoA)—who've always got something to say—are sending mixed signals on the online travel sector. But let's be real, the data from AirDNA suggests Airbnb's 3Q booking growth is solid. They're anticipating around 114 million nights booked and total bookings upped to $18.2 billion. Especially in the Asia-Pacific region, the Nights and Experiences should be popping off.

Factors like average daily rates going up, driven by foreign exchange, mix shift of larger homes, and geographic mix, is expected to have impacted the to-be-reported quarterly performance. Moreover, strength across Cross-border nights booked, owing to increasing international travel demand, is likely to have aided Airbnb’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

Regulatory drama in New York has been a hot topic, so expect Airbnb’s management to focus on long-term bookings on the platform. 

* “CEO Brian Chesky has suggested new long-term rental initiatives will be announced as part of Airbnb’s winter product update,” they wrote in a note to clients.

Keep an eye out for other gems in the earnings call, like insights into their long-term rental game plan and other potential moonshots like sponsored listings, which could hype up growth rates for 2024.

Additionally, increasing travel demand, growing awareness around hosting, and introducing new tools for hosts are likely to have resulted in strong supply growth across all regions and market types in the quarter under review. Also, strong momentum in new active listings, driven by reduced fees for longer stays and monthly discounts, is likely to have been another positive.

All these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the third quarter. I think we're in for a potentially epic earnings here, that can send ABNB to the moon. 🚀🌕 I'm gonna grab a ABNB 11/03 122c @ 2.91 each. You could also opt for a call spread, buying the 120c at 3.90 and selling the 125c at 2.03. This means you can grab the spread for 187 bucks, with a capped potential gain of 2.7x. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Tomorrow we have AAPL, SQ, DKNG, COIN, and CVNA so keep your eyes peeled!",2023-11-01,45,61
17ll6zi_ABNB,ABNB,"$ABNB's 3rd quarter 2023 earnings: the good, bad and ugly","Here is a summary of the good, bad and ugly aspects of Airbnb's Q3 2023 earnings:  
  
The Good:  
\- Revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $3.4 billion.  
\- Nights and experiences booked increased 14% compared to last year.  
\- Adjusted EBITDA was up 26% to $1.8 billion.   
\- Free cash flow improved 37% to $1.3 billion.  
\- Active listings grew 19%, showing continued supply growth.  
\- International expansion progressing well in markets like Korea.  
  
The Bad:   
\- Growth is slowing, with revenue increasing less than prior quarters.  
\- Adjusted net income declined without the one-time tax benefit.  
\- Guidance signals slowing momentum, with expected revenue and booking growth deceleration in Q4.  
\- Faces rising competition in the travel industry.  
\- Regulatory risks remain, as seen with the New York City law impact.   
  
The Ugly:  
\- Macro uncertainty from economic trends and geopolitics poses risks.  
\- Profitability excluding tax benefit declined this quarter.  
\- If growth keeps slowing, Airbnb may struggle to justify its valuation.  
\- Competitive and regulatory pressures could intensify.  
\- Recession risks loom larger, which could severely dampen travel demand.  
  
So in summary - not all doom and gloom, but cracks are showing in the growth story. The business is maturing and risks are rising. Investors have to weigh the opportunities against some challenges that could get nasty if conditions deteriorate. Airbnb may not be as hot a growth pick as it used to be.",2023-11-01,42,38

1634lul_ABNB,ABNB,Abnb starting to look attractive,"I have been following ABNB for some time. I’d argue it’s a “wonderful business” and a candidate that is worth paying up for because it might compound capital for a long time. It’s had an incredibly high top-line growth rate, compounding at over 25% YOY for the past 5-6 years. FCF margins are quite massive, 40% or 30% if you adjust for SBC. The company generates a positive “float” from the period when they charge the guest for the rental and when it is paid to the host. It should be fairly inflation-proof as it charges a percentage of the gross booking value, GBV is correlated to rents, rents should keep pace with inflation.  The main expense for the business is for software engineers, and costs should drop for software engineers over time as AI reduces product engineering costs. 

Currently the company has $3.9 billion in TTM FCF or $2.9 billion if you subtract out SBC. It has a market cap of $80.2 billion or $72.2 billion if we back out excess cash on the balance sheet. That puts it about 25X trailing FCF which seems okay for an incredible business that is growing a lot. It really doesn’t require any meaningful capital investment to grow, so the ROIC is very high and this frees up lots of excess cash. The company dedicates basically 100% of excess cash to share repurchases. 

I don’t really see any way any competitor can attack the business, except for maybe a few dedicated locations or local regulators boxing out Airbnb. There are 3X as many listings on Airbnb versus VRBO, the next largest competitor and the mindshare of Airbnb is massive. VRBO/EXPE has been spending over 4X Airbnb’s marketing budget and still can’t catch up. There is a risk over time that the massive spend from VRBO pushes up ABNB’s marketing budget but we haven’t seen it yet. 

There’s an interesting opportunity with the longer rentals to disrupt the rental market more generally. There are lots of high paid remote workers, particularly in tech, who are migrating around the country and the world living out of Airbnbs. I think most analysts are still thinking of ABNB as part of the travel and leisure sector and a competitor to hotels, but I could see Airbnb taking a slice of the much larger rental housing market.",2023-08-27,17,62

Shares of Airbnb rose about 11% in extended trading Tuesday after the company released fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates on top and bottom lines.

Here’s how the company did:


EPS: 48 cents vs. 25 cents expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.


Revenue: $1.90 billion vs. $1.86 billion expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 24% year over year. Airbnb reported $319 million in net income for the quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $506 million, surpassing the $432 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

In its shareholder letter, Airbnb said it’s seeing continued strong demand at the start of 2023. The company said revenue in first quarter will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, above the $1.69 billion expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Airbnb said it made difficult choices to cut spending during the pandemic but has modestly increased its headcount over the past two years. The company said it expects to “continue hiring at a judicious pace in 2023,” and that, compared to 2019, its headcount is down 5% while revenue is up 75%.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 88.2 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year, but below the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb said in the investor letter that travelers are returning to major cities, which has historically been one of the “strongest areas” of its business. The company said domestic and short-distance travel continued to be strong, but it saw “even further improvement” in longer-distance and cross-border travel during the quarter.

Airbnb said guest demand and supply growth remained strong throughout 2022.

Average daily rates decreased by 1% from a year ago to $153 in the fourth quarter. The company ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings, which reflects an increase of over 900,000, or 16%, compared to 2021.

Airbnb said it’s “particularly encouraged” by market share gains in Latin America, continued recovery within Asia Pacific and European travelers that are booking summer vacations early.

The company will hold its quarterly call with investors at 4:30 P.M. ET Tuesday.",2023-02-14,305,112

The implied move for ABNBs earnings has risen by about 1% over the past couple of weeks. This might be driven by pressure on margins and changes in consumer spending patterns, but there is some buzz on WSB as well, which would indicate that retail traders are bidding up the price of options.

110vapn_ABNB,ABNB,AirBnB is going to shit the bed on earnings,"AirBnB occupancy levels had fallen MoM for 8 straight months straight by the end of October, with AirBnB's management expecting holiday revenue for 2022 to be below analysts' expectations. This, combined with local governments cracking down more on short-term rentals + rising consumer dissatisfaction with the procedures involved with staying in AirBnBs, makes me think AirBnB's revenue and EPS may fall short of the Street's expectations for them but, more importantly, I think they'll reduce guidance for Q1 2023. 

On the flip side, US hotel occupancy rates were at their 4th highest levels for Q4 from the last 23 years during Q422, with occupancy at 54.2%, and with 40 markets, including Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago, saw their highest occupancy ever for the last reporting week of the year. This, combined with the fact that hospitality research firms are expecting strong Q1 and Q2 growth for hotel carriers compared to 2022 due to a lack of Omicron on people's minds + already seeing huge explosion in average daily rates and revenue per available room when compared to pre-pandemic levels, makes me think that MAR and H are great plays for 5% swings within 2 weeks of reporting later this week if you get in on Monday.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uhopnr/airbnb_beats_estimates_with_70_revenue_growth_as/)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q1-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q1-2022.html)

[Airbnb](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABNB) reported better-than-expected results on Tuesday and gave an upbeat forecast for the second quarter, as the company sees a [rebound in travel](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/americans-are-ready-to-travel-as-their-omicron-fears-fade.html) coming out of the pandemic.

Here are the key numbers:

* **Loss per share:** 3 cents vs 29 cents expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $1.51 billion vs $1.45 billion expected, according to Refinitiv.

[Revenue](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312522138654/d711122dex991.htm) in the first quarter surged 70% from a year earlier, despite pandemic concerns, “macroeconomic headwinds” and the war in Ukraine, the company said. Airbnb’s net loss narrowed to $19 million from $1.2 billion the same quarter a year ago.

Growth is expected to stay strong in the current quarter. Airbnb said revenue will be between $2.03 billion and $2.13 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.96 billion. The low end of the range would represent growth of 52%.

However, the company said that risks to bookings include “additional Covid outbreaks, any impact to travel from the conflict in Ukraine, and consumer price sensitivity.”

For the first quarter, Airbnb reported 102.1 million nights and experiences booked, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Analysts expected the number to come in at 100.87 million, according to StreetAccount.

Travelers are also becoming increasingly confident in booking trips further in advance. At the end of April, the company had 30% more nights booked for the summer travel season than at the same time in 2019.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $17.2 billion in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street’s estimate of $16.54 billion, per StreetAccount. That’s up 67% year over year.

Average daily rates rose 5% from a year ago to $168 in the quarter. The company anticipates ADR to be flat in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis.

“Stable ADR in Q2 2022 suggests that Nights and Experiences Booked growth in Q2 will be a good indicator of GBV growth in Q2, both on a year-over year basis,” the company said.

Airbnb has benefited from changes in the way people work and travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Workers were no longer tethered to their desks and remote options became the norm, with many work-from-anywhere policies still in place today.

Airbnb said last week it would allow its employees to [work from wherever](https://news.airbnb.com/airbnbs-design-to-live-and-work-anywhere/) they want in the U.S. Starting in September, staffers can also live and work in more than 170 countries for up to 90 days a year in each location.

Airbnb said long-term stays of 28 days or more remained its fastest-growing category by trip length compared to 2019. They accounted for 21% of gross nights booked in the first quarter.

The company also gave an update on its humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Airbnb [offered](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/28/airbnb-to-offer-free-housing-to-100000-ukrainian-refugees.html) free, temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing the war. To date, more than 14,000 people have received temporary accommodations through Airbnb in Europe, and more than 34,000 people signed up to offer their homes to refugees, the company said.

After people began booking listings in Ukraine with no intention to stay as a way to support hosts, the company waived guest and host fees. Airbnb said that approximately 600,000 nights were booked in Ukraine in the quarter with a total GBV of about $20 million.",2022-05-04,33,5
uhopnr_ABNB,ABNB,Airbnb beats estimates with 70% revenue growth as travel rebounds - $ABNB,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q1-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q1-2022.html)

[Airbnb](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABNB) reported better-than-expected results on Tuesday and gave an upbeat forecast for the second quarter, as the company sees a [rebound in travel](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/americans-are-ready-to-travel-as-their-omicron-fears-fade.html) coming out of the pandemic.

Here are the key numbers:

* **Loss per share:** 3 cents vs 29 cents expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $1.51 billion vs $1.45 billion expected, according to Refinitiv.

[Revenue](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312522138654/d711122dex991.htm) in the first quarter surged 70% from a year earlier, despite pandemic concerns, “macroeconomic headwinds” and the war in Ukraine, the company said. Airbnb’s net loss narrowed to $19 million from $1.2 billion the same quarter a year ago.

Growth is expected to stay strong in the current quarter. Airbnb said revenue will be between $2.03 billion and $2.13 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.96 billion. The low end of the range would represent growth of 52%.

However, the company said that risks to bookings include “additional Covid outbreaks, any impact to travel from the conflict in Ukraine, and consumer price sensitivity.”

For the first quarter, Airbnb reported 102.1 million nights and experiences booked, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Analysts expected the number to come in at 100.87 million, according to StreetAccount.

Travelers are also becoming increasingly confident in booking trips further in advance. At the end of April, the company had 30% more nights booked for the summer travel season than at the same time in 2019.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $17.2 billion in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street’s estimate of $16.54 billion, per StreetAccount. That’s up 67% year over year.

Average daily rates rose 5% from a year ago to $168 in the quarter. The company anticipates ADR to be flat in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis.

“Stable ADR in Q2 2022 suggests that Nights and Experiences Booked growth in Q2 will be a good indicator of GBV growth in Q2, both on a year-over year basis,” the company said.

Some of the largest cap names in the QQQ report earnings this week and the reaction of the market to those reports will likely determine whether these levels hold.

Those levels did not hold and as the indices cracked implied volatility spiked. The market was led lower by stocks like Amazon, which was -14% on Friday following an unpleasant reaction to its earnings report on Thursday afternoon. Of the large companies to report, Meta and Microsoft were able to buck the trend and finished higher on the week.

This week’s earnings aren’t large-cap market movers like last week, but they are reporting into an environment of very high market volatility, the highest of this earnings cycle (so far).

stdmp7_ABNB,ABNB,Airbnb beats on earnings and gives strong guidance.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q4-2021.html

>Airbnb beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue in its fourth quarter, as the travel company continued to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic.

>The company’s stock jumped more than 7% in after hours trading.

>Here are the key numbers:

>Earnings per share: 8 cents vs. 3 cents expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts
>Revenue: $1.53 billion vs. $1.46 billion expected by Refinitiv
>Airbnb expects first-quarter 2022 nights and experiences booked to significantly exceed Q1 2019 levels. It estimates revenue to fall between $1.41 billion and $1.48 billion in the first quarter of 2022, topping analyst estimates of $1.24 billion.

>The company reported 73.4 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, down nearly 8% from the prior quarter and missing estimates. Analysts were expecting 74.96 million nights and experiences for the quarter, according to StreetAccount. Still, the figure is up 59% year-over-year, when the Covid-19 pandemic weighed heavily on the travel industry.

>Airbnb said in its fourth-quarter letter to shareholders that it has rebounded quickly from the impacts of the pandemic. The company said the negative effects of omicron on bookings and cancellations were lower than it experienced with the delta variant. Gross nights booked in December were up more than 40% compared to 2020, the company said.

>“Despite the continued near-term uncertainties, we see evidence of strong pent-up demand: as of the end of January 2022, we had over 25% more nights booked for the summer travel season than at this time in 2019,” the company wrote.

>Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $1.5 billion, up 78% year over year. Airbnb reported $55 million in net income, its first Q4 profit. It’s a decrease from the prior quarter but a huge improvement from the $3.89 billion net loss it posted in Q4 2020.

>Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter, slightly over Wall Street estimates of $11.08 billion, according to StreetAccount.

>Average daily rates rose 20% from a year ago to $154 in the fourth quarter.

>Airbnb has spent much of its time focusing on a sort of “travel revolution,” as remote work becomes a more permanent option for many across the U.S.

>As a result, Airbnb said average trip length during the past two years increased by about 15%, with stays of more than seven days now representing nearly half of all gross nights booked. Meantime, long-term stays of 28 nights or more continued to be its fastest-growing category by trip length. Those extended stays accounted for 22% of gross nights booked in the fourth quarter, up 16% from Q4 2019.

>The company said it had its greatest number of listings yet, but did not provide a figure.

Shares are up 5% in AH.

Personal take: I personally remain bullish on Airbnb, and I think they are one of the companies that will strongly benefit from a post-Covid travel surge worldwide.

qmm9wa_ABNB,ABNB,ABNB DD/All in,"Airbnb earnings is upon us, sharing my DD and my wife's boyfriend's portfolio

Q2 Revenue came in at 1.3B and estimate is 2B, though a beat on revenue is already priced in with the trend seen in consumer spending and BKNG ([bookings.com](https://bookings.com))'s earnings.

All the data points to a roaring quarter for travelling, from airline, hotel and now BKNG's ER. Increase in travel is priced in. However, BKNG revenue came in at 2.16B for Q3 vs 1.14B in Q2, assuming ABNB did not lose market share, there's a lot of upside potential still. Reviewing alexa metrics and google search trends, I'm not seeing signs for a loss of market share, so in the best case scenario, we could see 2.6B for revenue. Given the pricing power companies had in the last quarter and there was no reduction in host fees (ABNB's \~15% cut), I'm expecting a revenue surprise without a miss a profit margins.

This would put ABNB's price/sales numbers in the same ballpark as BKNG, and given the growth trajectory of ABNB, this means tendies for years to come.

Airbnb will begin housing 20,000 Afghan refugees globally FOR FREE. As of Monday, the U.S said it has evacuated 48,00 people from Afghanistan. It’s actually not just a one-time thing. Airbnb often offers free housing during times of crisis since 2012. (Source: CNBC). Although ABNB didn’t say how long they can stay for.  I do believe all the refugees will have a better life outside of that war.

They had a 9.97% surge on Tuesday. There’s no other news that day except the free housing offer mentioned above. You might wonder: How is this helping the stock or the company?   
Many people think of this as an overreaction because nothing fundamentally changed. However, I see this as a clever marketing strategy/ reminder for investors to buy in the forgotten stock by helping out the refugees. It’s a win-win. So why not?

The Travel Industry is undoubtedly the hardest hit by this pandemic. But, the vaccines have come in as a ray of hope. 

The rebound in the travel industry could only be possible in the last quarter because people got their jabs! Otherwise, the travel and hospitality sector just stumbled badly.

But the rise of Delta Variant, not only in the US but in other parts of the world is alarming. Many tourist places were shut. If this virus stays here longer….and the authorities do not devise effective measures to fight back, it can grievously hurt the travel economy! And, somewhat, Airbnb knows it well. 

If we look at the second-quarter earnings of this company- Airbnb, it has reported a revenue of $1.34bn, four times higher than the Q2 FY2020 and 10% up in 2019. Wall Street expected the company to report revenue of $1.26 bn, FactSet’s estimates tell. 

“Total nights and experiences” booked in the second quarter were 83.1m, almost 200% higher than the 2020 bookings. Analysts had expected it to be 79.2m.

In 2020, people were not allowed to travel across countries, there were reasonable restrictions but the ease of such restrictions surely showed a way to tour and travel in the summer of 2021. Though the ease in domestic travel boom owing to increasing vaccination rates and easing restrictions has helped AirbnbThe company is still clueless on how the traveling trend of the people in the fall of this year will be. Additionally, International sales are still a matter of concern. 

So, in conclusion, the surmounting **precariousness**, and the psychological-cum actual impact of the Delta variant on the travel industry is as real as it gets. Perhaps, this uncertainty is not allowing investors to bet on this stock. After the announcement of the Q2 financial report, Airbnb shares fell 3% during the extended trading session, and today in the pre-market hours, its shares slid by almost 2.5%.",2021-08-13,43,45

Delta CEO said:  **""We're into a full recovery of our business, led by the U.S. consumer,""** 

\- On July 22 AAL Beat on EPS but misses on revenue

AAL CEO's said  **""incredible"" post-COVID recovery and that its business is ""well on our way to getting back to normal.""** 

\- July 29 Hilton beat on EPS missed in revenue

HLT said: **Hilton expects continued strength in leisure demand and further upticks in business travel to drive continued resurgence in the back half of the year. The hotel operator sees full year net unit growth of between 5.0% and 5.5%.**

# ABNB last earnings

\- May 13  EPS of -$1.95, Revenue of  $886.9M (+5.4% Y/Y) 

 Airbnb attracted over $10B of bookings in Q1 2021, an increase of over 50% from the same prior year period as travel returns.

# ABNB Business

Tech company based in silicon valley that offers the home of people who want to rent it for small periods of times, to people who want to travel or work.

The houses they offer are inspected and well photographed so guests know what they are renting.

They profit from a fee of \~10% from the guest.

Currently ABNB has 4Million hosts from all around the globe.

Since covid ABNB has expanded their business to other areas like experiences (cooking, pets, sailing, surf, food/wine tasting).

Usually their hosts offer houses that are competitive to hotels but may lack hotel normal services (except cleaning)

Airbnb offer insurance up to 1Million dollars in case guests damage the property, recent case from a party in Dallas, which led to airbnb ban parties and guests who might be into parties.

Airbnb model protects them from house expenses, in a covid world they have no expenses with unrented houses and rooms unlike hotels.

# ABNB keeps it Safe

As you can see trusting your house to strangers might not be relaxing, thus Airbnb needs to offer a safe ecosystem of people who can be trusted.

Hosts need to be sure their property will be intact and guests want to get what they paid for.

For that Airbnb has a method of rating, both host and guest will review one another. In this process they can filter out the worst guests and hosts, and keep the good ones.

Creating this environment is important for hosts, as they can know, how the guests they are receiving, have behaved in previous houses. 

Leads to less uncertainty and more focus on making their property more appealing to well behaved guests.

# ABNB Chart

Since February ABNB defined a clear resistance line that is merging with resistance at 130$.  
The stock is currently testing the resistance at 143$ which might be broke after a strong earnings.

As google indicates in the ? icon:

> Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means that there was not enough data for this term. 

It's clear that interest over airbnb is rising once again.

**When Do I Close The Trade?**

The market is in a peculiar place. If you lean towards playing growth names in tech you'll probably notice many of the tickers on your list are still down about 30-40% from their highs in February. What's the market done since then? Most indices are at all-time-highs. How does that make sense?

Over the last several months there's been a significant rotation into financial services, energy stocks, and industrial materials. Recently, those sectors have pulled back while the overall market continues to rip higher.

I do see some risk when I look at charts such as SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc. A broad (and healthy) market pull-back might affect many stocks on my watchlist, unfortunately this also includes the ones that are still down 40% from recent highs.

None-the-less, timing the market is something I am not very good at, but one of my particular skills is buying the @\*#&ing dip, a la Buffet style. I've got a few stocks on my radar for this week.

Before I get into them, people often ask me when do I decide to sell my position. This is something that can't be easily answered. Speaking from my own perspective, I generally give myself a minimum timeframe of how long I expect to hold a stock versus holding until a short-term price target. This time-frame is at least 6 months because I want to be able to say “This company is trading at X, but in 1 year I believe it will be Y”.

For example, SOFI is a ticker that in my opinion is in the early stages of growth. I would be comfortable holding this name for 2-3 years or until something fundamentally changes with the business that has me doubting it's future. It’s at $16 now. Do I think it has potential to be $35-40 by this time next year? Yes. Does that mean if it short-squeezes to $25 next week I might also sell it? Yes.

BlackBerry on the other hand, could be a mixture of both price targets and durational hold. Everyone is betting on BB’s turnaround story, which might happen depending on how strong their integration of their IVY platform is with new vehicles and EVs. This is something that could play out 1-2 years from now, but it might also participate in a squeeze next week that could drive the price way above fair value.

When a stock price becomes detached from reality and what I believe to be ""fair value"" is when I like to take some off the table or exit my position. Every investor manages and reacts to risk differently, so it’s also about finding what works for you.

&#x200B;

Before we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.

&#x200B;

**Chart Guidelines & Terms**

I use the term ""meme stock"" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.

&#x200B;

Moving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.

""Red Zones"" are high-risk lotto plays.

""Orange Zones"" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.

""Green Zone"" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.

&#x200B;

As always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.

# The Meme List

**Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)**

Industry: Steel

Steel has had a huge role in the ""rebuild better"" idea as well as being an inflation play. Steel prices have soared and producers have not been able to keep up with demand. In my opinion this demand is more than cyclical (short-term rotation) and could be a continued trend in the future.

CLF has already seen some huge gains YTD where it doubled in price. After hitting $24 a share it's hit a roadblock, but could be primed for another move up after this recent consolidation.

&#x200B;

**BABA Holdings (BABA)**

Industry: e-commerce giant (China)

BABA is one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. This was on track for $400 a share last year until a lot of uncertainties around China began to surface. There is a massive crackdown on Chinese stocks going on and this is a risky play, nonetheless I do like where it's currently trading and technically might be at the base of a cup and handle chart pattern. This ticker has been known to pick up on a lot of social media hype as well which could be the fuel needed for a moon mission.

&#x200B;

**Tilray (TLRY)**

Industry: Cannabis

Anyone who was around in 2018 saw this name at $150 a share, looking back I still can’t believe it. At $14 a share this is a different story. TLRY is trading at 6-month lows with the possibility for another chance at a squeeze. IMO could be a decent play if you are patient enough to wait for it.

# The BTFD List

**Air BNB (ABNB)**

Industry: Lodging

ABNB was seeing volatile price action post-IPO with almost weekly 25% swings. After peaking at nearly $220 per share, it is currently down about 40% in the $140 range. You’ll notice the orange zone I highlighted from April, which could have shown to be a good entry point, but wasn’t (as does happen). At $140 a share I like this name based off their branding and as a re-opening play.

&#x200B;

**Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)**

Industry: Video Games

TTWO is a lockdown play that will still continue to see success as the world re-opens. Video games have gained popularity with streamers leading the way. Grand Theft Auto 5, created by TTWO, is the second most successful video game of all time, losing the number 1 spot to Minecraft. It is rumored that GTA 6 is to come out sometime at the end of 2021 or 2022. Which is already priced in, but might be a catalyst should the brand see a strong launch.

My imaginary green zone is very close to the current stock price. I’d rather be early than late so I might nibble on a position next week.

&#x200B;

**Biogen (BIIB)**

Industry: Drug Manufacturer

This ticker has come up frequently on some of my social checks. I can’t say I know much about BIIB, but the stock ripped +80% in early June and has since cooled off. Any time a stock goes up that much in such a short amount of time there is going to be huge volatility. IMO there might be more downside to the trend-line and channel at $280, but I think there could be a good entry sometime soon or even at current levels.

oegb65_DNA,DNA,Investing in homes with Airbnb demand,"One of the downsides of (owner-occupied) home ownership is obviously that you're tied to the property insofar as you do not have the flexibility to migrate or travel as easily as you can on a year-long or month to month lease, other liabilities of home ownership i.e. risks of not paying mortgage, going underwater, etc. notwithstanding. Additionally, many HOAs prohibit short-term rentals a la Airbnb.

One of the investment notions that occurred to me was looking at something like AirDNA to determine where the demand is (or isn't) for short-term rentals and then using that as (part or most of) your purchasing criteria, so that if you want to, say, fuck off to travel for a few months you are not having to finance *two* living arrangements, as you normally would.

What are the down-side risks to taking this approach beyond the ones I'm listing below?

So far I can think of:

1. tenants damaging your home, although I assume that would be covered by the short-term-rental merchant's insurance less a deductible
2. (1a.) additional wear and tear on your home and appliances, furniture. which would probably not be covered by the merchant's insurance, although you could buy extended warranties on some stuff
3. You could potentially pay a premium for purchasing in an area with high short-term rental (STR I'll call it) demand outside of the regular premium you would pay for living near a beach, etc.
4. Your local government could ban STRs, as has been attempted and probably accomplished (off the top of my head I know parts of San Diego were trying this)",2021-07-05,10,21

o0eeku_ABNB,ABNB,$ABNB DD - Waiting to explode over the next few months,"Hey Apes, Long time lurker of the sub, recently just made a reddit account as I think I have some solid DD! Not financial advice, just giving my opinion. Here's some reasons why I think Airbnb ($ABNB) is ready to 🚀🚀🚀 over the next few months:

* As first-world countries (where $ABNB generates most profits) have started effectively rolling out their vaccinations programs, ""staycations"" to different cities/regions within countries will go up as a lot of countries have international travel restrictions. 
* In addition to this, many large companies have are beginning to accept work from home policies, with employees getting tired of staying at home, and having no real reason to be in a specific location, staying in Airbnbs will become increasingly popular. 
* The stock started trading on IPO at around $140, and exploded to highs of $220, this is a popular stock that people can get behind. It is currently trading at $150, its a good deal right now - people seem to have forgotten about it.
* Over the closure of Airbnb in many regions, I imagine the company is silently waiting for the world to open up more and have a ton of marketing campaigns ready, furthermore they have 100+ new features ([https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/](https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/)) ready to go. They still even managed to attain $3.4bn in revenue during the pandemic, when the world opens up, I see exponential growth on this.
* I truly believe in the future, people will get bored of staying in hotels, as Airbnbs offer a more affordable and authentic experience. I not only believe the stock will explode in the next few months, but continue to grow in the next 5 years, it's a good company to hold.

I have only recently started investing over the last 2 years (I only have around $1500), but this is my first DD i'd like to share with you guys, tell me what you think! 

**TL;DR -** $ABNB is at a good price, they have been laying dormant over the pandemic and I expect them to explode with the world slowly opening up more for travel and their new features they have been working on; they continue to innovate in the space and I think they are a good long term hold.",2021-06-15,6,8

npzbz9_ABNB,ABNB,Is AirBnb ($ABNB) Ready to Moon Post Covid?,"Wanted to share some thoughts on AirBnB, as we just talked about this on our latest Podcast.

$ABNB is going to be turning into a juggernaut post-Covid and be the service type of company people thought UBER was going to be. Not only does $ABNB want to be the leader in vacation stays but also be the company to take care of you during your whole vacation from flights/Rail, ridesharing, drinks/food/goods with delivery.

Did you forget your toothpaste? $ABNB has someone deliver it to our door within an hour. Want some wine and dinner waiting for you at your Airbnb stay the moment you arrive? Boom done… If Airbnb got into the airline's space they would do a thing called wet-leasing which If Airbnb decided to wet-lease aircraft, they would not necessarily see the same startup costs a traditional airline would see and it would allow for them to ‘proof’ their concept before buying planes for themselves. $ABNB has the cash to make all this happen with 3.5B cash on hand to potentially create a vacation/outlet super app that is only just going to keep growing post-Covid. They even have the cash to buy YELP for 3.5B with YELP market cap at 3B so $ABNB can get into the reviews space and make it better by putting it on the Airbnb app while running ads creating a new revenue stream and cornering the review market forcing people to go into the Airbnb app where they could end up booking dinner even near home using the app while seeing Airbnb ads making them think they could use a vacation and book it while they are having dinner.

The thing they can work on is the Airbnb experiences and scale this up to be a big part of the revenue. Try the Amazon prime model with a membership to get “discounts” on food/stays and also these experiences to entice users to try it out. Flat discounts on products, probably additional bundled discounts for multiple services. Perks can be things like discounted ridesharing and goods delivered anywhere in the world as ABNB potentially partners with the major players in ridesharing/delivery as well as airline space. The reward program is easy; you can already establish a hotel-style reward program and layer in other benefits as you expand into other industries. Many companies will still be paying for employees to travel in the future.

Locking in big corporations with a membership that gives them prime pricing on flights, hospitality, etc. will yield big, consistent revenues - and make Travel & Expenses (T&E) much better. Also speaking of hospitality, ABNB could partner with some hotels and retrofit some better rooms and charge a high price than have the hotel take care of the cleaning and collect the cleaning fee so both parties win in this and hotels know ABNB can kill their business long term so join forces and not get wiped out.

Overall I think YELP acquisition would be the smartest move they can make in the short term and forget about wet-leasing planes for a few years until the balance sheet gets healthier post-Covid and fully recover but the acquisition of YELP with the cash wouldn't add debt and would increase user base numbers while providing extra revenue streams. One key stat to pay attention to is the average stay on Airbnb is now 28 days so it is not just weekend getaways/vacations but for living as well. Now that the lockup period expired and those who wanted to get out shares have done so, now the selling pressure should dry up in the mid 100s and we go back to the 200s.

npjq8q_CRWD,CRWD,"Cleanest Options Flow from Last Week - Setups going into Next Week - QQQ, CRWD, ARKK, PAGS, ZM, ABNB","I built a bot a couple of weeks ago  that looks at the live options flow all day and finds heavy repeated  flow where a lot of money is being spent. This type of flow can predict  future price activity especially if the contracts are out of the money.  Based on this principle, here are some great plays with cleanest options  flow from this week.

All of these are potential plays that I'll be playing in the next few weeks. Hope folks will find these beneficial both for day trading and swing trading. 

Let's start with **$ZM.**  There were a bunch of puts bought towards 330 and a put bought above  ask for 250 all expiring in the next few months.  There was some  interesting call flow towards 400 but very little.  Play here is 330  puts for July/August.

&#x200B;

**$PAGS** this was my favorite flow that we caught last week. There were tons of 50 calls and a lot of money was being spent on them.  The stock has already gone from 45 to 49 based on the flow we caught. But there seems to be more upside.  Plays is 52.5 September Calls.

&#x200B;

**$ABNB** another excellent setup here. There are a few puts here but quite a lot of calls towards 140-150. Clean flow!  The play here is 140-150 calls for August/September.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iraf5tlagk271.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=957850c17a84c0beb5f553b75e4c226980d13b4a

**$CRWD** I believe we have earnings here this week. Risk setup but there's abundant flow towards 230-235 calls.  Play here is to just follow smart money. June 235 calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4c1dg24bgk271.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7ced6e73c42114770e42f796bba8e363a1ba56

**$ARKK** some heavy puts here + reveral after touching the 50 moving average. We are still in a downtrend so this can also be an excellent hedge play if you are into growth stocks.  Play here is 90-100 puts 2 months out.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zc5zxpbgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&s=89a75abac961d937daeee3d0fe4c6d7fa0e20d0a

**$QQQ** this is a lotto play but there are tons of heavy puts on QQQ last week. I'd buy a few puts far out of the money both as a hedge and as a lotto.  Play here 315 puts for July 16.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oyohc7cgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&s=f966f2f5d24580c962389f5b54edc6982b6a0e91

**$UBER** final one here. Heavy calls towards 55 strike + clean flow.   Play here is 55 strikes for August 20. Follow the expiration here! Don't go short term.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p0ozdducgk271.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e9c24ef143ff0f505574901d56c0df621e31b93

That's it. Please always do your own DD along with these plays for the best results. Options flow should always be coupled with price action analysis to find the best plays. Also, let me know if this is something the community likes. I can post these every week.

Cheers! Good luck with your trading this week.",2021-06-01,37,12

n91i30_ABNB,ABNB,Interesting Week For $PLTR $BABA $COIN $ABNB $DIS,"Big names to look out for this week includes $PLTR $BABA $COIN $ABNB $DIS, it could be very lucrative if you make the right option plays this week.

Be careful for the IV Crush, please trade with caution! Anyway the two big names I’m looking out for is $PLTR and $COIN. 


Palantir has seen its stock fall from $45 to $19 this year, after a disappointing Q4 Results. Although Palantir’s quarterly revenues came in stronger than expected, it posted a quarterly loss. Palantir’s revenue guidance for the full year 2021 was also lower than expected. Do you expect $PLTR to beat Wall Street estimates and surge after their Q1 earnings reports? The safest strategy for me, might be to play Iron Condor. 


Coinbase, the disruptive tech company. $COIN has trended lower since it went public on April 14, falling from levels of about $328 per share on listing day to about $281 per share. Some analyst  believe $COIN is very reliant on Bitcoin, 
which has also declined by almost 15% since Coinbase went public. I believe $COIN will have a very good Q1 Report, but I also do believe the cryptocurrency trading platform competition is building up. Coinbase are known for their expensive fees which account for over 80% of its revenues, with many other crypto competitors are offering lower fees. I wonder if we will see a uptrend from $COIN this week.

These expected moves can help with strike selection, as well as a gut check on any positions going into the event (for instance if you have an OTM call way beyond the expected move). Stocks tend to stay within their expected moves around 65-70% of the time, but often those surprise moves beyond expected can be big ones, obviously. But when long options, and not getting a move beyond the expected move you are faced with an overnight vol collapse. Conversely, when short options via credit spreads, you're essentially rooting for the stock to no move beyond the expected move.

n69r2t_ABNB,ABNB,ABNB earnings coming up. Buy ABNB (w/ positions),"https://preview.redd.it/5ksb7wu5pix61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7078b8199c807dc72f18a9bf66930c6483c509

Thesis/TLDR:  Buy ABNB.

AirBNB (ABNB) is undervalued and will bounce leading up to and beyond it's earnings date on 5/13/21.

Current Price: $153/shareMy Target Price: $185 by end of May

It is my intention to purchase additional calls if the price continues to drop leading up to earnings date.  I may also accumulate additional shares.

&#x200B;

ABNB and IPO'ed in December, hit a low of $122 shortly thereafter before finding a high of $219 on Feb 11th. It has trended downward since.

This is a heavily shorted stock with 22% short interest reported. Detractors believe the stock to be overpriced and will argue that the pandemic will continue to weigh on revenues and that the stock will see outsized competition from hotel groups other travel sites like VRBO. Regional legal challenges also remain a significant factor.

These issues noted, I believe this is a growth stock with it's best days ahead of it and the recent drop in price to be overdone. The whole thing reeks of manipulation to me. This is the ""go to"" vacation rental stock for so many areas and generally has a better reputation and much more momentum than it's competition. Larger trends and the pro/cons of airbnb aside, I believe that the earnings and guidance presented next week will set into motion what will be a relatively quick rise to $185 and beyond in weeks to follow.",2021-05-06,22,26

m307et_ABNB,ABNB,Why $ABNB is going vertical,"...Because I know none of you peasants book hotels anymore... and why would you? Airbnb is the only way apes travel. The upside potential on this stock is huge. 

I don’t do fundamental analysis. The only rule I have when investing is to buy companies that still have a visionary Founder or CEO who manages their business for growth instead of boomer metrics like quarterly earnings. $ABNB still has their founder at the helm and the guy is obviously a cold blooded killer. You don’t build a company like $ABNB otherwise. That said... If I were to do some kind of “analysis” I would say... 

1. $ABNB just crushed earnings.
2. They handled the pandemic extremely well, like as good as any company really could. They basically did everything right. Got a $1billion loan, cut cost (they even cut exec pay across the board) and at the same time protected customers. I’m sure you had an Airbnb booked when the pandemic hit and got a full refund... just think about how shitty your experience was with canceling your airline tickets. They also launched a fund to reimburse hosts for cancelled stays and opened a fund to help hosts pay mortgages. Point is they handled a major crisis extremely well, which goes back to my point about capable leaders managing for growth.
3. Travel is going to explode this summer. I know every single one of you has a wedding or some kind of event booked every weekend from July 2021 to Dec 2022. Where are you going to stay... Marriott?

This stock reminds me of $TSLA. $ABNB is positioned to be the single largest travel company in the world and actually provide a great service. They will start turning a profit within the next 12 months and the stock will make a major move up. Eventually it is going to get into the S&P and then 🚀🚀🚀🚀

after l checked on the date and can't find a definitive answer - the rest of the info is correct including all prices/strikes/dates/vol 

It did gain 30ish percent so I closed it - sorry if you felt misled

$ABNB 2/12 $200c is 10x normal vol. ahead of earnings (???)

Trade details: Feb calls are getting tons of action, I will add to position based on end of day and earnings. The 2/5 $190c was flagged as unusual and there is a bunch of calls behind it.

The strategy: pretty straightforward earnings play - target $200 and exit

I chose it for a number of reasons, ABNB is still new and no one really has a handle on the true value of the stock - the went public and then had to deal with a pandemic. Also, as a reopen play, and finally as pure spec.

I own this call.

kpy4sr_SNOW,SNOW,IPO Price Predictions [DASH - ABNB - SNOW - PLTR],"Hey day traders,

In my most recent YT video, I took a quick look into DASH, ABNB, SNOW, and PLTR, using support & resistance, fibonacci retracements, trend lines, and parallel channels to help predict the next major move in each.

If you want to watch, you can check it out here! [https://youtu.be/ALGJG28DTQY](https://youtu.be/ALGJG28DTQY)

And of course, if you have any feedback, comments, or questions, I'd love to hear them!

**TLDR VERSION**

**DASH**: Currently in a declining wedge, and a break-out above it (and above \~147), would be an excellent long signal to play towards all time highs

**ABNB**: I'm looking for a long entry some time very soon on ABNB, ideally around $140. My first price target would be upwards of $190

**SNOW**: I'm looking for just a little bit more downside of SNOW, to around $270-276, before an awesome long entry may show up

**PLTR**: I'm looking for a bit more downside on PLTR as well, ideally to about $18. Once we get there, I'd have an extremely bullish stance on PLTR to upside targets of potentially $58.",2021-01-04,0,0

I am normally a buy and hold investor.

So that sucks.

Full text of the email below. 

Thank you for participating in Airbnb’s Directed Share Program.

Should you have any account maintenance questions, or if you would like to sell shares, please contact your existing Financial Advisor. If this is a new relationship with Morgan Stanley, you can contact your new Financial Advisor team at (Redacted)

You can monitor your account online at Morgan Stanley Online going forward. Please use the Username and Password you established on the Directed Share Program website to access your account online. If you need to reset your password please click here.

You may only sell your shares by contacting your Financial Advisor team as noted above; you cannot sell shares on Morgan Stanley Online at this time.

The shares that you purchased in the Program will show in your new Morgan Stanley account within 24 hours of the IPO date.

**EDIT 2** I had to call and sit on hold for 20 minutes, but I ended up setting a sell Limit Order of $150, which was exercised almost immediately. So I made my initial investment back plus a small amount and have 18 free shares to let ride and see where it goes. 

For those who gave me grief for not going all in, all I can say is that everything I read in /r/stocks and /r/investing over the last week was fairly negative about ABNB as an investment and the IPO, including when I asked about doing this. I guess I wish all of the naysayers (about my paltry $2500 investment here) had something to say then.

**Dallas, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - December 1, 2020) - World Series of Golf, Inc. (OTC Pink: WSGF) (""WSGF""), in conjunction with its new sharing economy technology business focus serving the short-term rental market through its subsidiary, Vaycaychella, has engaged Goldman Small Cap Research to conduct ongoing analyst coverage. Goldman expects to issue an initial research report next week, on Tuesday, December 8th, 2020.**  


**Barron's reported today, ""Airbnb is scheduled to price its initial public offering on Dec. 9 and trade Dec. 10, three people familiar with the situation said. The start-up is expected to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker ABNB. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are lead underwriters on the deal, according to Airbnb's prospectus.""**  


**Over the last three years, Vaycaychella has built a business serving short-term vacation rental operators with financing to acquire and renovate real-estate properties as vacation destinations. Vaycaychella's current customer base currently spans Caribbean vacation destination clients from Mexico to Puerto Rico. Vaycaychella has provided over $1 million in acquisition and renovation financing secured by 10 premium beachfront houses with a combined estimated value of approximately $10 million. Vaycaychella last week announced adding a boutique hotel to its portfolio of vacation properties.**  


**Now Vaycaychella is scaling its business operations to serve vacation property entrepreneurs (""rentrepreneurs"") globally by introducing a sharing economy, peer to peer application (P2P App) to connect rentrepreneurs with investors. The P2P App has been built and is currently being tested. Vaycaychella management anticipates soon initiating beta user testing.**  


**Vaycaychella management believes the Company's initiative to scale operations with the introduction of its sharing economy P2P App to empower rentrepreneurs is ideally timed in conjunction with Airbnb's IPO. Airbnb has initiated a roadshow in anticipation of an IPO later this month valuing its business at $33 billion.**  


**Vaycaychella management anticipates the Airbnb IPO will be a watershed event bringing to light the full potential of the sharing economy to entirely transform global capital markets. Airbnb has more rooms to rent (7 million) than the five largest hotel operators combined (4.3 million) - Marriott, Hilton, Intercontinental Wyndham and Hyatt,**  


**In short, the advent of sharing economy technology like Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash and we believe, Vaycaychella apps, empowers everyday individuals around the world to combine their personal resources (homes, cars, savings and talent for example) under a single organized business, that can compete with if not dominate any traditional Fortune 500 competitor.**

&#x200B;

December is set to be the busiest year-end on record for initial public offerings in the U.S., with DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc. ready to start trading this week in long-awaited listings.

The two startups, which are aiming to raise a combined US$6.2 billion at the top-end of their price ranges, will propel the month’s IPO volume to all-time high, surpassing the US$8.3 billion mark set in December of both 2001 and 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IPOs on U.S. exchanges have already raised a record US$156 billion this year, the data show.

Both listings got an additional boost as the companies headed into the final stretch of marketing their shares. DoorDash upped the price range for its stock in a Friday filing, while Airbnb is planning to follow suit and increase its price range ahead of its IPO, people familiar with the matter said Sunday. The companies are now each expected to raise as much as US$3.1 billion, putting them among the top five biggest U.S. IPOs of 2020.

Private companies that sat out the market chaos in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic -- and were awaiting a final outcome in the U.S. election -- are now rushing to go public. Airbnb and DoorDash will quickly be followed by three other mega-listings that could add billions of dollars to the IPO tally.

Also on deck to go public this month are Affirm Holdings Inc., which lets online shoppers pay for purchases such as Peloton bikes in installments, online video-game company Roblox Corp. and ContextLogic Inc., the parent of discount online retailer Wish. Each is likely to attain a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in its listing.

“This group of companies that you have coming out now maybe weren’t thought of initially as benefiting, but they’ve been able to show very strong results despite the coronavirus,” said Karen Snow, head of East Coast listings at Nasdaq Inc.

Airbnb is aiming to be valued at as much as US$42 billion in its IPO, while DoorDash could hit a valuation of about US$35 billion, based on their updated price ranges. For DoorDash, that’s more than double the private valuation it hit in a June fundraising round, after it seized on the pandemic-fueled boom in demand for meals brought to your door. Airbnb had been valued at US$18 billion in April after raising additional debt to shore up its finances. The company, which was initially hit hard by global travel restrictions, has more recently seen a boom in customers seeking longer-term, domestic rentals.

Airbnb’s IPO will also be a lucrative event for many of its employees. The company has offered billions of dollars worth of stock compensation to staff, similar to Uber Technologies Inc. and other large venture-backed companies that have gone public. The IPO will make some of its longtime employees millionaires on paper.

**Time and Cash**

Earlier this year, technology IPOs were dominated by enterprise software companies such as Snowflake Inc., which has soared more than 200 per cent since its listing to a US$110 billion public market valuation. This month’s cluster of soon-to-be public entities -- all based in the San Francisco Bay Area -- cater to consumers stuck at home with extra time and cash on their hands.

Should the listings go well, it could signal investors are optimistic about an economic rebound after the dark days of the pandemic.

“There’s a lot of support and interest from institutional investors for companies that are impacted by COVID because the feeling is that they will recover,” said Neil Kell, Bank of America Corp.’s vice chairman of global equity capital markets.

“The mindset is not that we’re in December of 2020,” he said. “The mindset is how is it going to look a year from now.”

One enterprise software listing is also planned for this week. C3.ai Inc., founded by former Oracle Corp. executive Tom Siebel, is expected to raise as much as US$527 million in its IPO.

**Gauging Demand**

Bankers are using new methods to execute these large share sales, incorporating technology under development for years that was well-timed for use during the pandemic, when potential buyers can’t meet the company executives and advisers in person.

Airbnb, DoorDash and Roblox have asked prospective IPO investors to fill in their deal orders via an online portal, indicating their level of interest at any desired price, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.

The new process is aimed at helping issuers and their advisers gauge demand, especially for high-growth companies subject to wide differences in valuation among investors, the people said. The final price and share allocation are still determined by the seller.

Representatives for the companies declined to comment.

Unity Software Inc., used the same system in its September IPO. Unity sold its shares for $52 each and ended its first day of trading at US$68.35. The shares closed Friday at US$150.94 apiece.",2020-12-07,96,50
k87gbo_SNOW,SNOW,Airbnb Boosts IPO Price Range to Between $56 and $60 a Share,"Airbnb Inc. plans to boost the proposed price range of its initial public offering, the latest sign that the red-hot IPO market is ending the year on a high note.

Airbnb is boosting the range to between $56 and $60 a share, from $44 to $50, people familiar with the matter said. The new range would give the home-rental company a valuation of as much as $42 billion on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.

DoorDash Inc., the food-delivery company that is expected to debut Wednesday, the day before Airbnb, plans to price its shares at the high end of or above its range of $90 to $95 a share—already raised from between $75 and $85, people familiar with the offering said. That would give the San Francisco company, the largest among its peers, a valuation of as much as $36 billion or more, on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.

Taken together, the developments are the latest sign that the market for new issues, already at a record in terms of money raised in the U.S., is set for a climactic ending to the year. The market has been buoyed by soaring stocks, including those that have recently made their own debuts.

So far this year, more than $140 billion has been raised in initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record high set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that dates back to 1995.

Valuations of both Airbnb and DoorDash have been boosted after roughly a week of investor meetings known as roadshows.

December is typically a quiet time in the IPO market. This year there will instead be a flurry of offerings. In addition to Airbnb and DoorDash, videogame company Roblox Corp. and the parent of online retailer Wish, ContextLogic Inc., are expected to debut before the year is through.

For companies now, including Airbnb and DoorDash, roadshows have been conducted differently than they would have in the pre-Covid-19 world. Executives have been marketing their offerings to mutual funds and hedge funds in Zoom meetings rather than in the typical whirlwind tour across the country.

Both Airbnb and DoorDash and their respective underwriters will set their final IPO prices in the coming days. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are leading Airbnb’s IPO, while Goldman and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading DoorDash’s.

ABNB

Airbnb (ABNB) is a hospitality company focused on disrupting the hotel and travel industry with apartment and house rentals with(out) a host. ABNB has grown since its inception in 2007, “We have experienced rapid growth since our founding. In 2019, we generated Gross Booking Value (“GBV”) of $38.0 billion, representing growth of 29% from $29.4 billion in 2018, and revenue of $4.8 billion, representing growth of 32% from $3.7 billion in 2018.”. Now despite taking losses with COVID-19 affecting the two industries they are focused in, they show great prospect with “Experiences”, financial statements from prior fiscal years, and an expansive market when quarantine restrictions loosen.

\- ABNB has great growth internationally, allowing them to prosper in other countries when the U.S. may not be doing well economically or otherwise. “As of September 30, 2020, we had over 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of the United States.” Having 14% of hosts inside the U.S. allows for a possible increase in the U.S. Market, but also shows ABNB’s resilience with having the majority of hosts international and available when certain countries may experience political issues or economic crises.

ABNB may seem questionable from an American view, but their structure of maintaining security and building trust with guests and hosts is a centerpoint to ABNB’s success. “Our host protections include property damage protection and liability coverage. In addition, our trust and safety initiatives include risk scoring, watchlist and background checks, fraud and scam prevention, secure messaging, secure payments, and minimum age requirements.” ABNB must be able to maintain this trust, which can easily shift with the media and lawsuits they are battling at the moment as mentioned further in their IPO under Risk Factors. The risk that actions taken by the hosts, guests, or a third-party involving crime or vice can undermine the reputation of ABNB should be a reminder that ABNB can be fragile and is built around trust, not results.

ABNB addresses their possible market, saying, “We have a substantial market opportunity in the growing travel market and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for short-term stays and $239 billion for experiences. We estimate our total addressable market (“TAM”) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences.” This is a large market for long-term growth that they can capitalize on once a vaccine for COVID-19 is approved and distributed, catalyzing travel and hospitality.

Acknowledgement of competition is very thorough, noting not only ABNB’s competitors in the travel industry, but the hospitality industry as well. Various competing agencies along with their properties can significantly impact the success of Airbnb, depending on who attracts more guests in the long term.“Online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands [Booking.com](https://booking.com/), KAYAK, [Priceline.com](https://priceline.com/), and [Agoda.com](https://agoda.com/)); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/), Orbitz, and Travelocity); [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) Group (including the brands [Ctrip.com](https://ctrip.com/), [Trip.com](https://trip.com/), Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba) Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs;” The Chinese market is also noted as major competition. Despite the majority of revenue and earnings from EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), the Chinese market is one that could have positive benefits for ABNB’s reach on the global scale. More competition includes the hospitality sector with “Hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels; Chinese short-term rental competitors, such as Tujia, Meituan B&B, and Xiaozhu; and Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, and KKDay.” ABNB is battling two different fronts and it can be important to consider their role and presence in both. Hurting the hospitality sector and negatively impact their travel sector as well.

Another significant risk factor noted was natural disasters. Homes that are affected by natural disasters can decrease the supply of hosts available in various countries. This decrease in supply can leave ABNB struggling to retain guests and can negatively affect revenue.

In conjunction with ABNB’s international reach, they noted that their revenues could be negatively affected by foreign exchange rates. “For the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 60% and 50% of our revenue, respectively, was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated.” The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar can harm their profits and could create financial difficulties in the future.

Supply and Demand are both important when considering a company’s product. Looking at consumer demand, we see an increase even during the pandemic with “Approximately 76% of active listings had been booked in the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and 90% had been booked in the 24-month period ended September 30, 2020.” ABNB has a growing niche for hosting and we can expect this demand to grow after the pandemic as well as more people begin to travel abroad again and may not consider a public hotel.

Experiences were briefly mentioned, ABNB hosting experiences including cooking lessons, virtual activities, and virtual animal visits. There is minimal data and research on Experiences’ growth and valuation, but could be seen as a giant gap to purchase another company or grow.

Financial Summary:

Key Takeaways:

We have seen aggressive growth in product development over the past three years and then averaging around $690 million. Sales and marketing have also increased with over $1 billion, increasing their range of guests and hosts. Although we did see a dropoff in this expense, part of the decrease can be accounted for by the effects of COVID-19. Looking at Total Cost and Expenses, the largest sum was in 2019. ABNB’s filing for 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30 shows a decrease in these expenses. This can be because of a decrease in demand so a decrease in spending, but also shows that they are able to handle debt and can cut down on these expenses if necessary.

Key Takeaways:

Total assets are greater than total liabilities. However, we have seen a spike in liabilities in the last column, an increase of about $1 billion. Working capital is hovering between $1 and $2 billion. Cash and other equivalents are stronger from prior years, increasing cash in the final column, showing budget cuts ABNB has made to survive the pandemic.

The increase in Bookings year over year shows the growth of the industry and the potential it has to offer, increasing dramatically since 2015 and maintaining this solid growth.

The increase in free cash flow also supports this growing company. We do see a sharp decline in cash flow during 2019, but note that expenses also increased that year in the financial statement.

Despite the decrease in both domestic and international travel, domestic travel has rebounded significantly, showing the flexibility ABNB offers even during difficult housing times.

Most bookings are under 1 month; however, there are consistent bookings of more than 1 month stays, asking the question, is there a more viable option to rent long-term in a different area?",2020-12-07,50,12

* **The U.S. home rental firm had on Tuesday set a price range for its IPO to sell shares at $44 and $50 apiece.**

 

Airbnb now expects to offer shares for its initial public offering at a range between $56 and $60 per share, underscoring demand for new U.S. stocks, according to an [S-1/A filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520311265/d81668ds1a.htm) Monday.

The U.S. home rental firm had on Tuesday set a price range for its IPO to sell shares at $44 and $50 apiece.

At the upper end of the new range, Airbnb would sell $3.1 billion in stock and have a fully diluted valuation, which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units, of $41.8 billion.

This is well above the $18 billion Airbnb was worth in an April private fundraising round in the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, and above the $31 billion in its last pre-Covid-19 fundraising in 2017.

Airbnb’s stock market debut, slated for Dec. 10 on Nasdaq, will be one of the largest and most anticipated U.S. IPOs of 2020, which has already been a bumper year for flotations.

Record label [Warner Music](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMG), data analytics firm [Palantir Technologies](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=PLTR) and data warehouse company [Snowflake](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SNOW) have all gone public in the past few months.

Food delivery startup DoorDash on Friday also raised its IPO target price range.

I've been looking at Waiter Holdings for a few weeks, and I think the company is undervalued as is.   The company operates in 10 states,  It has an EV of approx. $320MM for a EV/FCF of about 7.  I believe a more sector appropriate ratio would be around 15, which would require the stock price to double.  Moreover, the company is currently profitable and seems to be designed for long term profitability.   Even more, as of late, there has been insider buying of shares, which I think is a bullish indicator.

&#x200B;

KEY POINTS:

* Airbnb filed an updated S-1 on Tuesday ahead of its expected IPO later this month.
* The company said it expects to price between $44 and $50 per share.
* That would give Airbnb a valuation of up to $35 billion, a rise from its peak private valuation of $31 billion.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

Airbnb plans to price at $44 to $50 per share in its IPO, giving it a valuation of up to $35 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to a new filing it submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. The company aims to raise about $2.5 billion in the initial public offering. Existing investors seek to sell $96 million worth of stock in the IPO.

Airbnb’s last private valuation was $18 billion, [after it raised $2 billion in debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/airbnb-raises-another-1-billion-in-debt.html) earlier this year as the company struggled in the early months of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/coronavirus-live-updates.html). That was nearly half its peak private valuation ($31 billion) from 2017.

The company will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker “ABNB.” It’s expected to hold its IPO later this month. Airbnb’s roadshow, where it makes its pitch to investors, will start Tuesday.

Airbnb released its first S-1 last month, reporting net income of $219 million on $1.34 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, down about 19% from the year before. Like most travel companies, Airbnb has seen a drop in business due to the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/).

But after cutting about 25% of its staff, or about 1,900 employees, in May, Airbnb saw its business quickly bounce back later in the year. That was thanks to a surge in rentals in rural areas as people looked for safe escapes amid the pandemic. The company was originally expected to go public in the first half of the year, but the crisis upended those plans.

But with markets ripping higher on positive vaccine news and President-elect Joe Biden’s election win last month, it’s a good environment for companies to go public now.

In addition to Airbnb, DoorDash, the maker of the popular food delivery app, is also expected to hold an IPO this month. [DoorDash released its updated S-1 filing Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/doordash-ipo-seeks-valuation-of-up-to-30-billion.html), and is seeking a valuation of up to $32 billion in its debut.

k3okkw_ABNB,ABNB,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

k3e4rs_ABNB,ABNB,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox," December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

 They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy.

k247uh_ABNB,ABNB,Is Airbnb a stock you should invest in ?,"Bullish

In this article I will explain why this is a good investment through my own eyes. All the information I express is what I was able to gather from Airbnb’s submission to the SEC. The truth is I was waiting for this IPO for a long time, and it is surely the most important IPO of 2020. The IPO is going to take place in December without a clear date being published and will be listed as (NASDAQ:ABNB). I will be covering the following matters:
• Company’s Overview
• The impact of the coronavirus – Financials
• Competitors – WHAT DISTINGUISH Airbnb from them
• Risk factors to consider
• Safeguards to consider
Company’s overview
Airbnb is a vacation rental online business, that allows people worldwide to find places to stay either for travelling purposes, or business purposes. It is used for short-term stays meaning a temporary accommodation. It was founded in 2008 and has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, United States. It has more than 7 million homes listed, and it operates in 100,000 cities. Does Airbnb own the properties listed? No, it doesn’t own any of them, in fact people like you and me that have a residential home can list it on Airbnb after successfully complying with its rules. This helps the homeowners to achieve higher occupancy rates since it gives them “automatic advertising” when they appear on the searches without them having to spend money on advertising. Of course, Airbnb doesn’t do that for free! It charges them a 14 - 16% whereas in some other cases 20% to those who offer experiences and this fee is deducted from the hosts payout. This fee can vary from country to country. 
Impressive how such a “simple” idea – two friends renting their house to help them pay their rent, twelve years later turned into a business worth $18 billion. Before the coronavirus pandemic Airbnb was worth $38 billion.
Coronavirus pandemic impact on Airbnb - Financials
I believe that from now on the Covid-19 impact on any business is very important to be mention for a thoroughly comparison of what it used to be and what may be again. According to Airbnb’s reports, in 2019 there was an increase of 32% $4.8 billion in its revenue and a 29% increase in the bookings to $29.4 billion. However, 2020 didn’t seem to be a good year considering the virus, revenues faced a decline of 32% to $2.5 billion and its bookings fell by 39% to $18 billion.
Needless to say, that the net losses from 2018 to 2019 have seen a huge rise from $17 million in 2018 to $674 million by the end of 2019. Pandemic widened these losses even more for 2020 accumulating at $697 million losses until September 2020. The total deficit was $2.1 billion as of September 30,2020.
These numbers are surely causing you to reconsider your investment in Airbnb so to spread your hopes up again Reuters estimates a valuation raise to $30 billion. Not to forget that Airbnb was valued $31 million in 2017 which is nothing to what it is valued now after the pandemic. In general, This IPO hopes to reverse this decline.
Competitors
Since Airbnb falls under the booking market, I need to highlight the many rivals it has since this is a small barrier business to entry.
1.Unlike Airbnb, Expedia group (EXPE) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) have both reported a steady earning report that shows operating profits increasing year by year.
2.HomeAway (AWAY) does not charge a fee for each booking like Airbnb does, and its only asking for an annually $350 to advertise the property. Meaning leaving the hosts with much more profits than Airbnb.
3. Trip Advisor (TRIP) which is a rival, reported a much smaller revenue compared to Airbnb accumulating $156 million in 2019.

What distinguish it from its competitors?
The company’s advantage over its competitors is surely visible for the following reasons:
1. Airbnb is 3 times bigger than Trip Advisor
Trip Advisor might be a competitor, but Airbnb has an advantage over it if you compare the sizes which means Airbnb does not have to worry about it, at least for now.
2. Airbnb has a rapid growth
Comparing the percentage changes, Airbnb has proved to be growing almost 10 times faster than Booking Holdings and 5 times fast than Expedia Group.
3. Airbnb is very liquid
The term liquidity means that a company holds available funds in the bank. According to Bloomberg it holds $2 billion cash in the bank which means it can help it overcome the losses and the negative events that bother their way.

Risk factors to consider:
Before the vaccine I would have definitely say third wave of Coronavirus, but after the vaccine news I am personally very positive that all this will be a history soon, but this is a different article.
1. The regulations for short-term rentals are becoming stricter.
Airbnb grew because of the non-existing regulations of short-term rentals, but after this rapidly growing business things became more apparent. There have been some incidences from hosts discriminating guests, blaming guests for damages, misleading them from the pictures, even some parties going on causing police engagement. But like Uber, Airbnb it’s just a technology platform connecting hosts with guests. Bottom line, it can be very difficult to come up with regulations in all cities and regions which give Airbnb space to breath.
2. The competition becomes bigger.
Other online booking services like, Booking Holdings (BNKG) that provides the same service. In addition, Expedia (EXPE) bought Home Away (AWAY) few years ago and raised competition. Likewise, a French hospitality Accor bought short-term rental One Fine Stay and Marriot International (MAR) partnered with home rental platform Hostmaker to provide short-term rentals. As it seems Airbnb changed the game for hotels and pushed them to pursue other strategies which points how strong of a player is.
3. Airbnb does not have a clear path of profitability.
In fact, Airbnb has not ever generated profit, and this is something big to consider. All this together seem to shadow Airbnb’s future. But, with the IPO going on, and the available cash in the bank there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.
Safeguards to consider:
1. The hotel sector has proved to be far more “destroyed” from Covid-19 than Airbnb which keeps it in a strong IPO position. Did you know that as of December 31, 2019 72% of 327 million Airbnb nights were booked by individual hosts? In other words, 92 million nights were listed under professional hosts by Airbnb. Moreover, Marriot International had 1.38 million rooms meaning almost 67 nights of full occupancy. Would these guests stayed there and keep Marriott’s properties full if it wasn’t for Airbnb? I don’t think so.
2. Recently, Bill Gates expressed his opinion on how the business travel will drop 50%. This can be very bad for hotels, but what about Airbnb? Because of the way everyone travels today, using online bookings and seeking to pay less for the maximum luxury, it makes it harder for hotels to beat the industry and especially Airbnb.
My Opinion
Investors need to consider all possible factors to form their decision. There is not a final price for the stock going IPO. At the end of the day is all a belief and since people will “value” it on the market I believe they will give it quite a high value at least in the long term. It is on my personal portfolio list, since the world is on track for a coronavirus free world.

k1qvku_TM,TM,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

>*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

>*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

>\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

>*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

jvic4y_ABNB,ABNB,AirBNB files to go public,"After long periods of speculation and anticipation, Airbnb, the online rentals marketplace, has formally submitted a public filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. Airbnb is looking to go public 12 years after its founding and with $6.4 billion in equity and debt funding raised over the years as a private company. Particularly, Airbnb is said to be targeting an IPO before the year runs out.

Airbnb's S-1 filing shows $4.8 billion in 2019 revenue and a net loss of $674 million in the same year. In the year before that, the company had $3.65 billion in revenue and a net loss of only $16.9 million.

In the first nine months of this year, however, Airbnb saw its revenue go down by a wide margin as the early months of the coronavirus pandemic brought about global travel restrictions that widely affected its business. The company posted $2.5 billion in revenue in the nine months leading up to September, compared to $3.7 billion in the same period of the previous year. The company's losses also more than doubled within that period from $323 million to $697 million.

As of the end of September this year, Airbnb reported having $4.5 billion in available cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. A significant part of that amount comes from the $2 billion in fresh debt and equity funding that the company raised in April this year when the coronavirus pandemic largely affected its business. The funding came from a group of private equity firms including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.

Notably, Airbnb actually turned a profit in its most recent quarter, reporting $219 million in net income on revenues of $1.34 billion. It comes after the company laid off one-quarter of its workforce in May this year.

Airbnb intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ABNB”. The company's public offering is being managed by a party of investment banks including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup, Jefferies, and Allen & Company.",2020-11-16,99,80
