1kflhsr_WBD,WBD,Popcorn Poppin $AMC Earnings,"https://reddit.com/link/1kflhsr/video/l9p5uvals0ze1/player

The Minecraft movie was an experience and is gonna rally AMC this earnings. People would scream and clap whenever Steve said ""Flint and Steel"" among other phrases.

The Minecraft movie grossed about 400M so far in the United States.  
The average ticket price is about $11. This comes out to around 36,000,000 people watching the movie. AMC operates 543 theaters across 43 states, representing approximately 27.5% of all 1,972 movie theater businesses in the United States. That's about 9,900,000 movie patrons.

All this is somewhat priced, what isn't priced in, is the popcorn. People and kids tossing this shit and making a mess is highly profitable for AMC. They have around 90% margins on popcorn. AMC's PPP (Popcorn Purchase Rate) is typically 36%. I think it's closer between 50% and 60% for the Minecraft movie. The price of Popcorn is about $9. Using the conservative end of 50% that's 5,000,000 buckets of popcorn at $9.

Analysts think AMC is going to totally shit the bed, but the Minecraft movie is here to save the day. All the kids throwing popcorn have to get it from somewhere. If everyone is throwing rotten tomatoes at the village idiot, buy the tomato stands not the village idiot.

You can buy WBD if you want, but popcorn has higher margins than movies.

1io18ih_AMC,AMC,AMC: At Rock Bottom and Ready to Rocket? Here’s Why I’m Bullish,"I’ve been following AMC for a while, and at this point, it looks like we’re approaching a perfect storm for a major price move. The stock has been beaten down to all-time lows, trading around $3.30-$3.50, and the volume has been consistently low. But history has shown that stocks trading at extreme lows with minimal volume often experience sharp reversals when the right catalysts appear. And I think those catalysts are lining up right now.

1. AMC Is Hugging the Bottom – and That’s Not a Bad Thing

Right now, AMC is trading at levels we haven’t seen since before the 2021 short squeeze. It’s sitting at a critical technical level where past reversals have occurred. If it holds this range and doesn’t break lower, we could see a major bounce, especially if volume starts picking up. Remember, when a stock stays suppressed for too long with low volume, it only takes a slight uptick in buying pressure to cause a violent move upward.

2. Goldman Sachs Just Took a 6.5% Stake – That’s HUGE

Goldman Sachs doesn’t throw money around for fun. Their recent 6.5% stake in AMC signals institutional confidence in the stock. Big players don’t buy into dying companies; they buy when they see asymmetric risk-reward potential. The last time we saw major institutional purchases in AMC, it led to strong upward moves.

3. Earnings Are Coming Up – Expect a Big Reaction

AMC is set to release earnings soon, and given how beaten-down expectations are, even a slight improvement in revenue or cost control could send the stock flying. Keep in mind that earnings reactions aren’t just about raw numbers – they’re about market expectations. If AMC’s results are better than feared, shorts could start covering, and the stock could spike.

4. The Short Interest Factor – A Squeeze Waiting to Happen?

While AMC’s short interest has come down from its peak, there are still millions of shares being shorted. More importantly, the stock’s borrow fee rate has been rising, which means shorting is getting more expensive. If we get a sudden spike in price, it could trigger panic covering, leading to a fast and aggressive move up.

5. Theaters Are Thriving Again – But the Market Hasn’t Priced It In

The movie industry is seeing a resurgence with massive box office numbers from recent blockbusters like Dune: Part Two, Deadpool & Wolverine, and Inside Out 2. People are returning to theaters, and AMC has positioned itself well to capitalize on this rebound. Revenue from premium formats (IMAX, Dolby) is higher than ever, yet the stock price doesn’t reflect these improvements.

6. AMC Has Been Quiet – Too Quiet…

AMC has a history of pulling unexpected moves when people least expect it. Whether it’s strategic debt restructuring, asset sales, or even crypto and gold-backed popcorn plays (yeah, we all remember that one), Adam Aron has shown he’s not afraid to shake things up. If AMC announces something major – like a profitable quarter, a new business venture, or a stock buyback – the stock could go parabolic.

The Bottom Line:

AMC is trading at rock-bottom prices, has big money (Goldman Sachs) stepping in, a potential short squeeze setup, and upcoming earnings that could be a game-changer. This is the kind of setup that has led to major moves in the past.

I’m not saying it’s guaranteed to explode, but I’m definitely watching closely. What do you guys think?

Description

American holding company, which engages in the entertainment industry. It was founded in 2011 (as a successor to the Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC) and is headquartered in NY. It operates the eponymous cable channel and various other PPV channels and streaming platforms (amc+ and others).

Market Cap: $383.21 million  
Total Cash: $802.55 million   
Total Debt: $2.49 billion  
Enterprise Value (EV): $2,070.66 billion

OCF: $‪‪424.72 million  
FCF: $395.00 million  
Net income (TTM): ‪‪$58.18 million  
EBITDA: $1.44 billion

Debt decreased slightly over the last four years, the company pays no dividends.

Historical net income data:  
2020: $239.98 million  
2021: $250.60 million  
2022: $7.59 million (dent caused by one time restructuring charge)  
2023: $215.46 million

Nominal PE (Market Cap/TTM NI) is 6.6x  
EV/TTM EBITDA is 2070,66/1440 = 1,44x

Shareholders equity is ‪‪$1.05 billion so P/B (Market Cap/Shareholders equity) is 383,21/1050 = 0,36x

Cashflow from operating activities has steadily recovered after a drop from 2020 to 2021 (-80.84%) and has doubled TTM ($203.58 in 2023 to $424.72 million TTM). ROE is 5.54% which is low and stems from a low net profit margin of 2.3%.

Risks:

\*ROE of 5.54% is constrained by high interest expenses because of substantial debt ($2.49 billion) and unusual items (the industry’s average is significantly lower, but competitors like Netflix come in at \~31%)  
\* net profit margin at 2.3% due to non-operating costs  
\* the degrowth hypothesis seems more likely at the moment, as revenue forecasts show a declining revenue  
\* general sentiment is negative and might drive the price further down, as its short interest already sits at \~24%

Summary:  
low valuation at 6.6x P/E; good FCF; low P/B ratio of 0.36x; profitable; mixed financial strength situation

Catalysts:  
debt isn’t increasing but stagnating and the recent rate cut from the Federal Reserve can improve cashflow and debt management (D/E ratio of 2.37); there is still an ongoing transition from cable to streaming from which AMC might profit; AMC and Netflix closed streaming deal in July 2024; the worst case scenario seems to be priced in already;",2024-10-17,0,4
1fbzhl7_GME,GME,AMC has a TERRIBLE business model ,"AMC has a terrible buisness model.

In my honest opinion I see AMC as a parasite with a horrible business model. Every AMC I’ve been to across the states is nothing more than a parasite.

Not only are actual AMC theaters deteriorating in quality due to shitty management, but they are in horrible areas 9/10 times. 

How has this happened?

The death of brick and mortar stores and SPECIFICALLY American malls has left AMC theaters the only building left standing in some of the most horribly maintained abandoned mall lots possible.

Not to mention the shitty environment only breed shittier management. They’re constantly tucked away, like I said, in abandoned lots, behind a series of stroad mazes.

The only reason they are hanging by a thread is publicity from their promotional items, and their absorption of small theaters.

However they are spreading themselves EXTREMELY thin, nearly every well performing LOCAL theater in a 20-40 mile radius of me has been absorbed by AMC. They’ve completely ruined cinemas, rather than just deciding to purchase the cinemas under the AMC brand or as a subsidiary, allowing these locations to function under their wings. They’ve completely rebranded every theater as a fully AMC theater, changing staff, entire menus, signs, etc. I mean spending easily hundreds of thousands just to renovate. Not to mention renovating modern theaters which didn’t need renovation. 

My most local theater was a hub for the community, when I was a teen I chose to work there because of how genius some of their business model was, I felt like the environment and progressive adoption and implementation of technology was ingenious.


A few months ago AMC bought the building they literally put the menu monitors roughly 10+ ft up on a wall, much higher than they were before, despite the theater having already had LCD monitors. Brand new digital signage for theater rooms were removed for no reason. Etc etc. and this goes for nearly every location they have purchased.

I’ve seen 5 or so of my favorite local theaters become completely ruined due to AMC’s purchases.

They’re literally burning money as they destroy local cinemas, disrupting each individual location’s business model and aesthetic design and even their own ticket sales by making the theaters they purchase and own even more miserable to be in.  

Now it might seem like I’m just a disgruntled theater worker, but this couldn’t affect me less. I see so much hype of AMC conflated other value investments like $GME. But I genuinely believe that AMC is on a death spiral and is being utterly mismanaged to hell. If you value your local theaters, it’s time to start hating AMC.",2024-09-08,43,73

1es0t8p_AMC,AMC,Entertainment Sector Watchlist + Comparison ($LVO + $GNUS+ $AMC),"Since I’ve been doing a fair amount of research on $LVO, I figured I’d do a little bit of research on their entertainment sector competitors. Here’s what I came up with…

**LiveOne Inc. ($LVO: NASDAQ) - $1.58/share.**

LiveOne is an entertainment company with a platform that offers a wide variety of live entertainment consisting of podcasts, live streams, concerts, and more.

**Highlights:**

* ---> Recently signed an exclusive multi-year deal with celebrity medium Johnathan Mark to launch a top of the line podcast with PodcastOne, a newly acquired partnership of LiveOne. This is just the tip of their celebrity collaboration iceberg.
* ---> 18% Revenue Increase YOY
* ---> Library of franchises between music and podcasts continues to grow.
* ---> Livestream demand is constantly growing

**Genius Brands International, Inc. ($GNUS: NASDAQ) - $2.45/share**

Genius Brands International is a global children's media company that creates animated entertainment content for children. The company is positioned to capitalize on the demand for quality children’s content.

**Highlights:**

* ---> Genius Brands’ flagship property, “Kartoon Channel!,” is a rapidly growing digital platform offering a wide variety of content for kids, including original series and educational programming.
* ---> The company has secured partnerships with major media outlets and streaming platforms, expanding its content distribution and visibility worldwide.
* ---> Strong portfolio of intellectual properties, including “Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten,” Genius Brands is strategically positioned to capitalize on the demand for quality children’s content.

**AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ($AMC: NYSE) - $4.85**

Although considered a meme stock, AMC Entertainment is the world’s largest movie theater chain, with a significant presence in the United States and internationally. The company operates in the theatrical exhibition industry, offering a wide range of entertainment experiences to moviegoers.

**Highlights:**

* ---> AMC has implemented some initiatives to enhance the theater-going experience, including the introduction of premium large-format screens and expanded food and beverage offerings in all forms of theaters.
* ---> The company has leveraged its size and scale to negotiate favorable terms with film studios, ensuring a solid lineup of films for distribution.
* ---> AMC is exploring a variety of content offerings, such as live events and esports screenings, to introduce new revenue streams and attract a fresh audience.

That’s about all I got for now. Hope you all got something valuable here and I’d be grateful to hear an introduction to any other entertainment sector stocks.

1eanzit_AMC,AMC,How much AMC stock do I buy? Does 1 share give me double points on the app?,"I just found out that if I am an AMC stock holder I get double points when using their app as an A List Member…and I thought it would be funny to get one share considering it’s only trading at around $5. 

However now I’ve gone down a rabbit hole and I’m wondering if I should pick up a few shares just in case or if anyone should. Not a bunch just a few grand. 

I think movie theaters serve a function and having an air conditioned space where you can go has always made sense to me. It’s a relatively safe family environment and it’s good for people with kids. families spend money on their kids like single people spend money on their dogs or cats. 

But I think I’m bias and AMC is doomed but I want to believe it’s not. My question is more about how people here feel about AMC and the debate of will movie theaters always exist. Are there any futurists that have a prediction and what is that prediction. No wrong answers. Ultimately, if theatres will in fact exist then will AMC stock be worth anything. ",2024-07-24,0,26

I also wanted to point out for those that saw my last swing watchlist, $GLDG has already had a 10% move to the upside and nearly hit $1. Be ready to take your profits! Okay, now to the new stocks that are on my watchlist. 

*The Non-Meme Watchlist*

1. **$CRDL**

* Trend and Pattern: The chart shows an ascending channel pattern, characterized by upward-sloping parallel trendlines. The stock has been respecting this channel since November 2023, consistently making **higher highs and higher lows**.
* Recent Price Action: The stock broke out of the channel last Friday, but pulled back to the top of the channel. 
* MACD: Remains bullish on the daily chart
* The Set Up - $3 is not out of the question Looking for a bounce around this area and for this stock to continue it’s rise. However, I would have a stop loss below the channel just in case this pulls back even more. 

1. **$RNXT** - The Swing into July

* Trend and Pattern: The chart exhibits a descending triangle pattern, typically a bearish continuation pattern. The stock has been making lower highs, indicating sustained selling pressure.
* Support Area: There is a strong support area around 1.07, where the price is currently testing. $1 will also act as support. 
* Recent Price Action: Had a bad day on Monday, down 7%.
* The Set Up: Looking for $1 to hold and for the price to get back $1.20. Will be watching the volume and looking to deploy if it gets closer to $1. T**he closer it gets, the better risk to reward you will have**. (if you implement a stop loss)

*The Meme Watchlist* 

1. **$HOLO** - Currently being heavily shorted with what seems to be a strong community trying to create a short squeeze. We shall see if this happens.
2. **$AMC** - Very little price action right now outside of its recent pump in mid may, but was once a meme stock for a little bit, so you never know. 
3. **$NVOS** - Maybe not necessarily a meme stock, but whenever $NVOS pumps, it has similar price action to them. This one recently shot up over 150% so be careful with this one please.

1b0xmfj_AMC,AMC,WKHS buy button turned off during GME & AMC move.,"Nothing new with RH capping buys. Sounds like RH, as they did WKHs in dirty by pulling the buy option during GME. Yes, that’s right! Many probably forget or weren’t around when 48 additional companies had the buy option turned off during GME and AMC. 


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html


Workhorse was among those stocks and it killed the buying pressure. Hedgfunds have had three years to cover at lower prices and never did, shorted shares have only increased and/or all the short data is being falsified. I’ve seen chart-exchange completely stop reporting short data during the last 100% cost to borrow pop just over a month ago. Weird stuff happens weekly on this stock, so my advice to new holders, as a long term holder myself since 2019, get used to it!  

Stock holders authorized 250m shares during Q3 that could be used (roughly) at $0.40 or higher. After this announcement the stock nose dived below the price target, thus cutting WKHs knees out from under them. I believe (could be wrong) this is why workhorse chose to sell, then rent their own plant out from a land lord. This helped extend cash run until stock got back above the price target to raise additional funds. 

Stock is now back off the lows ($0.21), reaching a price target of $0.40 last week, followed by a nice 10-15% bounce again today.  Pending news releases based off prior managements comments include FAA certification via UPS flight forward partnership, updates on the expansion of stable and stalls to California with FedEx and possible POs for drones. Previous news includes confirmed truck sales in California, 15 going to mission linen and 5 W56 step vans going out to big-box (companies unknown at this time) for testing. 

So, do I anticipate the buy button getting turned off again on a large move, you bet, but will you hold unlike GME?  Yep!

AMC Entertainment's stock soared over 8% in premarket trading following the successful completion of its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering. The movie theater giant managed to rake in $325.5 million by offloading 40 million shares at an average price of $8.14 each. This financial shot in the arm comes at a crucial time for AMC, which has been grappling with liquidity concerns. The capital infusion also aligns with a 39% annual uptick in the industry's box office and AMC's monetization of the blockbuster 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' film.  
  
However, the fundraising move hasn't been without its share of controversy. AMC's financial strategy has been under scrutiny ever since it became a 'meme stock' in 2021. Retail investors fueled a frenetic price surge, prompting AMC to issue new equity at the height of the frenzy, raising $587 million. Subsequent legal battles over a proposed conversion of AMC Preferred Equity units (APEs) and a reverse stock split complicated the company's efforts to stabilize its share price. This latest share offering follows a year in which AMC's stock price plummeted, erasing nearly 90% of its value. In spite of the past volatility and the risks flagged by AMC itself, the successful ATM equity offering suggests that investor enthusiasm for the company remains resilient.",2023-09-14,165,105

16cs732_AMC,AMC,AMC shares slide more than 30% after theater chain announces plan to sell additional stock - CNBC.com,"Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/06/amc-shares-fall-as-it-announces-plan-to-sell-additional-stock.html

Shares of AMC Entertainment fell sharply on Wednesday after the theater chain said in a filing that it plans to sell up to 40 million new shares to raise cash.

The stock dropped 36.8%, bringing it to $8.62 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, that is AMC’s lowest close on record, according to FactSet.

AMC was widely expected to sell additional shares after the successful conversion of the preferred APE shares into AMC common stock in August. It followed the settlement of a lawsuit objecting to the move.

The theater chain sold millions of shares of common stock in recent years after becoming one of the so-called meme stocks popular with retail traders. The sales helped AMC stabilize itself after the Covid pandemic effectively halted the theatrical movie business.

However, AMC used up its allotment of stock and needed shareholder approval to issue more. The company issued the preferred APE shares as part of a strategy to change its corporate voting structure and get shareholder approval to sell additional common stock.

AMC said in the filing Wednesday that it will sell the new shares through “at-the-market” offerings, without a specific time frame. Citigroup, Barclays, B. Riley Securities and Goldman Sachs are listed as sales agents in the filing.

The U.S. movie business remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the ongoing strikes in Hollywood have clouded the release slate for the rest of 2023 and 2024. AMC and pop star Taylor Swift announced last week that the theater chain is serving as the distributor for a concert movie of The Eras Tour to be released in October.",2023-09-07,566,380

15yy6ue_AMC,AMC,AMC shares plummet as investors prepare for stock conversion.," 

AMC Entertainment's shares experienced a significant drop of over 20%, reaching a new 52-week low of $2.46 per share. This decline was attributed to investor anticipation of a stock conversion set to occur later in the week. The company's preferred equity units, known as APE shares, are being converted into common stock after just one year of trading on the NYSE. These preferred equity units were introduced as a workaround to allow AMC to sell additional stock, circumventing concerns about dilution that arose when the company attempted to issue more stock last year. This stock issuance helped AMC raise funds during the COVID-19 pandemic when movie theaters were facing closures and limited content.

Additionally, AMC is planning a 10-to-1 reverse stock split of its common stock, which will result in an increased authorized share count of 550 million shares, up from the previous count of 52.5 million shares. This move allows AMC to issue more than 390 million shares. This increase in shares is aimed at addressing the company's debt balance.

AMC's recent share fluctuations were the result of legal disputes surrounding a shareholder vote to convert preferred stock to common stock and issue new shares. A revised settlement was approved by a Delaware judge in response to these legal challenges.

AMC Entertainment's shares plummeted due to investor concerns over a stock conversion and related issues. The company is taking measures to address its debt balance and financial stability, but analysts hold varying opinions on its future performance.

So several scenarios are possible tomorrow. AMC rebound to 2.90 and close in red. Again, the split AMC rebound to 2.90, and somehow it gains traction, and AMC squeeze. Shorts allow this to run up to 5 minutes (of course, longs will think this is the beginning of the moass). And when it opens at 50 on Thursday morning, they can short it down into the single digits again and make even more money. Thoughts?",2023-08-23,7,12

15btru0_AMC,AMC,"What's better, AMC or TUP?"," 

Both AMC and Tupperware have been in the news for different reasons for the past week. 

AMC, a cinema chain, experienced significant attention from retail investors and social media, resulting in a surge in its stock price due to speculative trading and a short squeeze.

Positive news about movie attendance (Barbie and Oppenheimer) and Friday's court ruling blocked their plan to convert preferred stock to common stock and issue millions of new shares contributed to the stock's recent increase.

Tupperware has seen a significant surge in its stock price, rising more than threefold in the last week. The shares rose by 56% on Thursday alone, contributing to a total gain of almost 350% in the past five trading sessions.

Tupperware, a 77-year-old company, had warned of potential bankruptcy in April if it couldn't secure new financing. The company has been trying to reposition itself to appeal to younger shoppers but has struggled to reverse its declining sales.

While AMC's recent stock surge was driven by movie attendance (Barbie and Oppenheimer) and on Friday's court ruling blocked their plan to convert preferred stock to common stock and issue millions of new shares, the reasons behind Tupperware's significant increase are unclear, and some investors may be cautious given its ongoing financial difficulties.

So I am looking forward to AMC as it is more profitable throughout the year than TUP, and TUP can soon enter bankruptcy. I also think its surge will not last so long and will come down.

So what are your thoughts about it? Is this the appropriate road for me, or am I taking a risky one? Please notify me.

155zisu_SNOW,SNOW,THE COURTS HAVE BLOCKED AMC FROM CONCERTING $APE INTO $AMC SHARES. A MOVE WHICH WOULD HAVE MASSIVELY DILUTED $AMC....LETS GO BOYS 💹,"AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) vaulted 61% after hours Friday, and as much as 100% -- and AMC Preferred Equity units (APE) nosedived 42% -- on word that a settlement paving the way for a share conversion was rejected by a Delaware court.

That marks a surprising win for the company's ""Ape army"" of meme-stock holders.

Delaware law provides that its Court of Chancery review all class-action settlements.

""Citing AMC’s financial situation, the parties have sought to present their settlement for approval on a compressed timeframe,"" Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn wrote in her opinion. ""Even moving quickly, the Court must ensure that the proposed settlement is fair and fulfills the principles of due process. To cut to the chase, the settlement cannot be approved as submitted.""

The settlement purported to release not only claims tied to the common stock, but also claims associated with preferred interests that common stockholders might also hold, and ""the release cannot properly extend to those latter claims."" It also purports to release claims that don't arise from the same factual predicate, she ruled.

The plaintiffs being common stockholders, they can't release claims appurtenant to the preferred units, she added. ""Awarding more shares to common stockholders necessarily comes at the expense of preferred units; the settlement consideration harms preferred unitholders.""

AMC had pursued a plan to convert APEs into AMC common stock; execute a reverse stock split; and issue shares to raise new capital.

That resulted in litigation to stop the plan, and then a quick class-action settlement that would allow its progress. The Court of Chancery applied the brakes so it could review the settlement, and has now rejected it.",2023-07-21,1359,597

If my assumption is true and AMC ends up below $1, I'll take $1.7 plus the calls expire worthless

If my assumption is true and AMC is above $1 I'll arbitrage $1.7 per share.

In any case I'll close the position a bit after the conversion, once the dilution has pushed the stock below $1 ($10 after the reverse split)

[Source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/3f3ec8db-88e0-4c69-8bfb-11ee45ab6932.pdf)

I was going to stay out of this whole mess, but what Adam Aron is doing here is absolutely disgusting and I need to piece out whats going on here. 

So to preface, AMC is in dire straits: 

* Its bonds are trading at 60 cents on the dollar. This basically means the markets don't believe AMC will be able to pay out its debt 
* The company has roughly $1B cash vs roughly $5B in debt and $5B in lease liabilities
* They lost money this quarter despite travel and service oriented companies just killing it. 
* Additionally all signs point to a weaker Q3 and Q4 going forward so it is likely Q2 will be their strongest quarter
* And to top it all off, they are unable to issue any shares because retail investors have blocked off any common stock dilution

**So how does a company get out of this without declaring bankruptcy?** They don't. Unless you're Adam Aron.

Well here is Adam's master plan. [The $0.01/share special dividend.](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx) 

The Preferred Equity Unit. 

Here are its important takeaways:

* Each Preferred Equity Unit can be exchanged for 1 common share, but only if **the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock**
* Each Preferred Equity Unit represents one hundredth of a share in the company's Preferred Stock (Note: Preferred Equity Unit =/= Preferred Stock!)
* Each Preferred Stock is in turn potentially convertible into 100 shares of Common Stock

Well retail will never vote for dilution... lets move onto the filings. 

* Holders of the Preferred Stock will initially be entitled to one hundred (100) votes per share and will vote together with the holders of common stock [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/1AnTszC.png)
* We may offer and sell, from time to time in one or more offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 (the “common stock”), **preferred stock**, subscription rights, depositary shares, warrants
and units, in amounts, at prices and on terms determined at the time of offering [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/DFe2WwM.png)
* Authorized capital stock of 50M shares of Preferred Stock (45M after the ~500M Preferred Equity Units are delivered) [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/JDTyXjV.png)

Here is where things get dicey. The company is going to issue up to 50M of these preferred shares that have 100 votes per share versus the current 510M common shares outstanding. What this means is owning 5.1 million preferred shares gives you the same amount of votes as all 510M common shares. Additionally, you the shareholder, will receive **Preferred Equity Units**, **not** **Preferred Stock**. **They can issue Preferred Stock, but are only giving you Preferred Equity Units.**

Circling back to the beginning, why does Adam Aron care about these votes so much? Its because AMC needs cash bad. AMC really, really wants to issue more shares, but retail traders understand that dilution = bad and is not willing to allow AMC to screw them over. Well here comes their fix. With these preferred shares, retail traders will not have a choice in the matter when share issuance comes up for a vote the next time around. 

Adam Aron is selling you this whole special dividend as a good thing, something to hurt the short sellers, when in reality its anything but. The Preferred Equity Unit will result in massive dilution for common stock owners. **This is not a good thing.** If you are buying in the hopes of a short squeeze, AMC's actions today directly work against that happening.",2022-08-04,3137,892

tvgb6i_GM,GM,"""bUT AMc iS CHeapEr ThAN GmE !!!"" Proven Wrong With Data","# Intro

Recently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of ""POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME"" or ""Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?"" or my personal favorite ""if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!"".

All of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.

Here are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a ""DD"" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886

https://preview.redd.it/zcg55iz2zcr81.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad8385b7a0c05247784da5d62ce52bf253744a3

There are others, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.

Here is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:

If company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.

If this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.

This ""trick"" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.

The psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a ""deal"" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.

&#x200B;

# The Proof

I took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54

The X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.

&#x200B;

# Let's do a hypothetical.

If you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.

(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)

I'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.

Now, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.

In this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.

In the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.

https://preview.redd.it/nztqxpt8zcr81.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc5f575d1bd9eb74ae0d7f4b598f4de2935c853

But price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want. NFA.

That was easy! I was like damn, I’ll take a 30% win every few days lol, for sure.

rh88ev_AMC,AMC,Thoughts on AMC? (NOT as a m3me),"Would love to hear opinions on AMC as a real investment, not as a m3me stock.

I bought into AMC because of two reasons:

1. I believe (and still do) that movie theaters will continue to recover in attendance over time as we normalize into whatever COVID is going to normalize into. The recent dip in the stock tells me it’s not baked into the price anymore at least. Still, I am optimistic about movie magic combined with the antsy-ness of a population stuck at home for further gains on attendance. Here’s a quick graph showing why I believe this so strongly: [https://www.the-numbers.com/market/](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/). Even if it never recovers to pre-pandemic levels, which I feel it will, there's still plenty of growth left.
2. I really loved the A-List program. Many people I know have started to adopt it, observed over the last several years. When I had free time, I’d go see multiple movies per month and felt it was a great deal. Now that I don’t, I still keep the sub around because I feel that I might. Classic subscription benefit for the company. Also being able to book for my friends without having to do the Venmo runaround is great, esp for sell out MCU premieres.
3. I see AMC as a medium term play. Is it a sustainable business over the long term and will movie going see long term growth over the next 5-10 years? Maybe, but I'm not willing to bet on that. I am willing to bet that there will be a stock bump from an attendance resurgence as we recover from COVID, so something more like a bet of 1-3 years.

Elon Musk posted a Twitter poll over the weekend asking whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. He followed with a tweet saying he would abide by the poll. “Yes” won. It’s unclear what would happen next, as Twitter polls are generally not considered legally binding. Tesla options are pricing about a 6% move for the upcoming week and about 12% for the remainder of November:

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.7% (or $7) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY about **$468**, that corresponds to just above **$473** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.50, up slightly from the week before and up a bit to end the week from lows it saw under 15 mid week. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **2.0%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $463 and $472 to see Max Gain:

The FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We’ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we’ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that’s not to say that there isn’t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we’ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who’ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There’s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that’s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we’re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-31,120,37

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:

## In the News

The FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We’ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we’ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that’s not to say that there isn’t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We’ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we’ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that’s not to say that there isn’t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we’ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who’ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There’s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that’s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we’re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me!

3. Short interest is 800K.
4. Therefore shares to the long side should be approx 2.73M public float + 800K shorted that longs bought. (legal) = 3.53M
5. We need the to show case an extended hold in excess of 3.53M to confirm on going naked shorting.

p1fylf_AMC,AMC,AMC says it will accept bitcoin as payment for movie tickets by year-end,"AMC Entertainment mentioned Monday it will begin accepting bitcoin as payment for movie tickets and concessions if bought on-line in any respect of its U.S. theaters. 

CEO Adam Aron mentioned throughout an earnings name Monday that the movie theater chain will have the IT methods in place to take the cryptocurrency as payment by the tip of 2021.

The transfer marks a wedding of two extremely speculative property — bitcoin, identified for its wild volatility, and AMC, which turned a meme inventory star favored by retail merchants on Reddit’s notorious WallStreetBets discussion board.

The value of bitcoin swung drastically in latest weeks, final buying and selling round $46,000 after falling under $30,000 final month. The latest rebound got here amid optimism {that a} cryptocurrency compromise will be included as a part of the bipartisan infrastructure bundle. The Senate finally didn’t advance the deal.

Tesla had introduced plans to allow bitcoin transactions, however it halted automotive purchases with the digital token in mid-Could as a consequence of considerations over how mining contributes to local weather change. CEO Elon Musk has since commented positively on bitcoin, saying he plans to carry the coin long run.

Shares of AMC climbed greater than 4% in prolonged buying and selling on Monday following a better-than-feared earnings report. The corporate posted a narrower-than-expected loss throughout the second quarter, together with income that topped analysts’ estimates.

The inventory has rallied practically 1,500% this 12 months as a band of retail merchants who coordinated trades on social media platforms managed to create a large brief squeeze within the shares. The struggling movie theater was a preferred brief goal amongst hedge funds and different gamers.",2021-08-10,4419,747

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! We’ve got meme week this week, so expect extra volatility alongside some absolutely stupid price action. I hope you all managed to close some profits last week during the chop. **$FSLY strangles returned 60% while binary options would’ve done around 300%. $ROKU strangles more or less broke even. $UBER and $LYFT both moved in tandem resulting in solid returns for most collateral plays.** I personally played $NKLA (even though I said not to) and lost 19$, while also getting punished by $SMG and losing a small chunk of premium. Managed to close out the week at roughly breakeven, which is honestly a blessing.  Will need to re-evaluate my plan going into this week! That being said, I want you all to be careful. Meme week is often not worth trading, and it may be wise to play the sell side if you’re really looking to scratch the itch. Similar to last week, if you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **$APPS has very expensive options.** Options are pricing in a 14% move, yet Digital Turbine only moves 8% historically. We can abuse this by selling a straddle or strangle and raking in those juicy premiums! The same holds true for $BIDU. Options are pricing in nearly 6%, while historically we get a move of around 2%. In this case, I would be a little more conservative when playing $BIDU, since it’s a Chinese stock, and we all saw how those fared earlier this month. Regardless, the premiums are there should we choose to play.

&nbsp;

- **Sample sizes are small this week. This is both a blessing and a curse.** Many companies who report have only recently gone public, meaning we don’t have our standard 20+ data points to draw conclusions from. For companies with less than a year of ERs under their belts, I wouldn’t look to the historical moves as a reliable metric. That being said, this leads to opportunity. Because some of these companies are so young, it’s going to be extremely hard for market makers to price their options efficiently and put a price tag on each companies potential “growth”. What is a good metric of growth and guidance for Coinbase? What about AirBnB? Literally nobody knows, meaning there’s the potential to make some money due to pricing inefficiencies.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see insane moves. We even got a sneak preview of this last week with $CLNE where we literally closed flat post earnings. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you go long. The best way to trade these tickers would be on the sell side, with OTM credit spreads or strangles. The premiums are extremely nice, and the moves will likely be weak. Keep in mind, this is just a guess, so there’s a chance I’m entirely wrong and get blown out, but I really feel like meme season is over, at least for now. MMs are going to be laughing all the way to the bank with these ones.

&nbsp;

All that being said, this week is shaping up to be awkward, so I’ll likely look to pull the trigger on some plays at the very last minute. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

Meme week up ahead! It’s probably best to sit this week out as it’s extremely difficult to trade with such a limited set of data and such a volatile pool of companies. If you really need to make some plays, look to prioritize the sell side, as those will give us the best risk to reward on our trades. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-08-08,367,113

Good afternoon. As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.

The biggest news of the day was NOK. A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit.

Other then that just a normal day. AMC(-7.65%), GME(-4.86%), and SPCE(-7.20%) were the biggest losers today. Everyone else kind of just slid around.

Below are the statistics for today.

As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most popular stocks on WSB. Everything is red today; $CLNE was the only one who pulled a meager +2.86%.

Total - 1,191,400,000 Short Volume over those two weeks with a strong majority of them never being in the money.

The only day that closed over the current share price ($56.26) out of the dates listed above was on 6/2/21 when we closed at $62.55 meaning that the rest of those shorts listed were/are out of the money for the entirety of their short life - pun intended. This is over a billion shorts that were either covered for a loss or were never in the money.

Here is where things get interesting in regards to dates:

T+35 is the time that shorts have to cover their position on the Fails-to-Deliver. While it is no longer in effect, I believe that the T+35 ruling would still apply to shorts that were purchased prior to the rule change.

On 8/1, when the Fails-to-Deliver come out on Fintel ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc)) - I am very much expecting the FTD number to be quite significant for the dates above + 35 days meaning anyone who shorted on those dates will now be forced to covering 35 days later or be an FTD. The reason for this is that the current share price has never dropped below where all of these shorts occurred meaning they either have closed their position and taken a significant loss or... they are about to.

5/25/21 + 35 Days = 6/29/21

6/11/21 + 35 Days = 7/16/21

Based on the numbers that I am seeing, we should expect an uptick in traffic/price starting next Tuesday, 6/29/21 and continue trough 7/16/21, ALONG WITH THE NORMAL TRAFFIC AND FOMO BUYERS!!!!

I personally believe that 6/29 through 7/2 will be a very good traffic/price increase and consolidation will start after that but time will tell.

This is not saying that the squeeze will occur in this time frame - Just that we should see a nice little jump that could potentially get us that catalyst that all the individual retail buyers have been chasing since January.

o3oskb_GME,GME,$CLOV- Serious Discussion: Is this stock the actual dark horse.. AMC & GME prepared us for???,"Is CLOV the true Dark Horse???

The technical setup:

It is rumored that over 50% of the available float is current shorted. However there is evidence 95% of the available float is in shorted-interests positions. The reason for the in discrepancy is because of they way they are counting Greenoaks capital’s holdings.

Greenoak’s shares are being counted and listed as a part of the available 155m float, however it has been uncovered that Greenoaks holds 93m in Class B shares that are convertible to class A. None of the shares have been converted, the paper work to covert the shares has not been filed and the shares are not currently available. At the same time these facts have surfaced,  there has been a big and coordinated push to suppress CLOV from trending. FUD has ran rampant this 1.5 weeks… it raised eyebrows when BoA coincidentally downgraded the stock.. as momentum began to spike up…. It should be noted that BoA has a decent short-interest position… 

Connecting the dots…

In recent weeks as institutions have been under the radar adding and accumulating short positions in growth sectors  on a separate but related trending topic “inflation” we have been witness to wall-street has been sounding the dog-whistle about inflation and how it’s not transitory. Those of you who know the markets and understand cyclicals know that these institutions and HF managers have been  in collusion on convincing the FED to raise rates….They know that would cause a market cool down to promote a rotation out of growth sectors. This is an efforts to drive the sector down so they can successfully close positions and make money on the pullback. The fed didn’t raise rates and those institutions and funds that prematurely took positions are nervous that they could be the next Melvin Capital if they get over leveraged in short-interest positions… 

Digging into the #’s

CLOV short interest is speculated to be above 90%.. but even at reported levels of +50% the stock is way over shorted,  if/when that  information gets out it will warrant a feeding aka buying frenzy.. 

I challenge everyone to take a little time and do your own DD.. 

Here is the Link to the 13G SEC filing that show Greenoaks Capital Partners shares as class b:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001801170/000090266421001020/p21-0536sc13g.htm

Giving further validity to this, it is rumored that CLOV was left off the 2021 Russell 2000 rebalance list due to not having enough voting shares available among its current common stock float 

Nasdaq List 184 institutional holders:

156,065,359 total shares held 
96,331,338 shares held by Greenoaks capital 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/institutional-holdings

If DD is correct that means only: 59,734,021 available float

Short interest on 5/28 was reported at 41,274,556

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/short-interest

That equates to 69.09 % it is rumored that short interest has increased 5-15% over the first 2 weeks of June.. those numbers should be out Monday. 

More of the numbers:

⁠CLOV

48.45% Short Interest with 100% utilization and super high costs to borrow according to ORTEX (6/19)

•	⁠100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)

•	⁠$700,000,000 in cash, no debt

•	⁠No threat of stock dilutions 

•	⁠Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is &gt;$30 for 90 days

•	⁠Citadel owns 7x more AMC than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.

•	⁠Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)

•	⁠Shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely), released “timely” information 🙄 about a DOJ investigation from months ago that didn’t go anywhere

•	⁠Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Post 6/8 run up there has been a desperate and frenzied efforts to spread FUD. Then another sub (to remain nameless) started removing all CLOV post and DD to control the narrative additionally in the “moderated” post we only saw propaganda downplaying CLOV as an attempt by HFs to distract attention away from GME and AMC and accusing this sub of being a HF’s (note the sub is only growing strong because of the FUD and unfair policing of CLOV post on other SUBs)

To continue: Since the $28 mini-pop on 6/8 

All these subsequent actions!!!!

 It makes me think that we have only seen a FRACTION of what is really hidden behind the reported numbers. 

There is a huge coordinated effort to suppress this information… I challenge all of you in this sub to follow the links and do your own DD… then come back with your findings and add to the discussion. It looking more and more like CLOV is the dark horse in this race.

Remember:

We buy the rumor and sell the news…  

Clover Health is a fundamentally sound business using machine learning and AI to help docs make smart decisions with patient care. The technology both increases the quality of care and reduces cost of care, something our country desperately needs.

The stock market is a wealth transfer device for moving money from the impatient to the patient.

 ***‘It is extremely tempting to short these stocks, but unless you have huge liquid resources, please try to resist the temptation because these prices can go to unimaginable highs before they settle down to a reasonable valuation, and you may have to cover on the high point.’*** 

Trying to bet against stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings [**AMC,** **23.34%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMC?mod=MW_story_quote) and GameStop Corp. [**GME,** **12.78%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GME?mod=MW_story_quote), may be a fool’s errand and particularly dangerous in a climate of a meme-stock revolution that has helped to propel the value of socially driven assets into the stratosphere.

Thomas Peterffy, the founder of Interactive Brokers on Monday, during an interview on CNBC’s [“Squawk Box”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)said that while it might be extremely tempting to short shares of AMC and others, he would recommend avoiding those stocks altogether.

Shares of AMC were up more than 19% early Monday and have gained 120% so far in June. GameStop shares are up 9.8% on the session and have enjoyed a 22% climb in the month to date.

The investments in AMC and GameStop originally started out as organized short-squeezes by a clutch of individual investors who had identified that a number of companies were heavily shorted by hedge funds and surmised, correctly, that those stocks could be pressured higher if enough buyers collectively swooped in.

The momentum for those assets has continued at an unprecedented level. In the year to date, AMC shares are up 2,555% and those for GameStop have climbed over 1,300% over the period.

By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.42%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) is up over 13% far this year, the S&P 500 [**SPX,** **-0.29%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has climbed more than 12%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained more than 7%.

On Friday, Peterffy warned investors, [in an interview with MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-brokers-founder-says-problem-with-amc-entertainment-memes-peoplewill-lose-a-very-substantial-amount-of-money-11622836260), that investors could lose considerable money betting on meme assets.

Traditional investing, even trading tenets, have been tossed out the window amid the hype over meme stocks, leaving many veterans and strategists to caution that a liquid market, supported by  the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policies, may be helping to inflate bubbles in parts of the market and promote FOMO, or fear of missing out.

That atmosphere is representative of a quote often attributed to financier J.P. Morgan. “Nothing so undermines your financial judgment as the sight of your neighbor getting rich.”",2021-06-07,264,45

nu5uji_AMC,AMC,The question isn't if AMC will crash it's when will it crash.,"Contrarian plays can be very profitable and an extremely satisfying way to trade or invest. I want to make this post on r/options because I will certainly get banned on Wall Street bets. The hype feels good, people feel they are a part of something bigger. but I want to rain on that parade because I can, after the squeeze the stock will most likely fall, here's my logic, AMC is discounting years of potential earnings into its current stock price, It has negative book value, but that is up for debate because they've sold more stock and can increase their business lifespan, regardless there isnt much that justify this price except short term hype, hence a good short, provided you can stick it out.

If deep ITM puts start getting some more volume, I am seriously considering buying, I don't want to get IV crushed so I'd prefer extrinsic be a very small part of price, I guess I could also sell calls 45 days out, and buy the shares since the calls offset a big chunk of the cost, I can't personally sell naked calls but that is a good option, especially if you have enough cash to roll out incase price sticks around these levels for more time than expected.

&#x200B;

One more thing, people think they are sticking it to the establishment by buying AMC and bankrupting the ""evil"" hedge funds who they perceive as the ones causing manipulation and overall unfair activity. I would say this is not true at all, while bankrupting hedge funds sounds cool, alot of them blow up on their own, and are just sophisticated versions of traders. If anyone is the enemy it is the major investment banks, they are incentivized to take on great risk for great profits while any major losses are paid by the tax payers. when hedge funds fail the economy doesnt tank (with the exception of LTCM, but they were involved with the investment banks) but when investment banks take major losses the financial web tears apart, since everyone is indebted to each other, those guys are the moral hazards, not some 100 employee fund with like 10 billion in AUM, Investment banks sometimes have trillions of dollars In AUM like Goldman. So please understand that a person isnt a crusader for justice by buying AMC, although the hype would make you feel otherwise. This subreddit is pretty sophisticated compared to wall st bets, so I doubt I won't get much hate here, but I welcome those who want to refute these points.",2021-06-07,9,31

Started [this series about 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/npjj9c/cleanest_options_flow_from_last_week_great_setups/) in another subreddit and many of the plays have been working extremely well e.g $ZM puts, $ARKK puts, $PAGS calls, $ABNB calls, and a lot more. You can check the previous plays by going to my profile.

Many of these plays are quite short term which is why I'm posting this in this subreddit.

# What is ""Clean + Repeated Flow""?

Any stock where the options flow has a single out of the money contract that dominates the overall flow has what I call ""clean + repeated"" options flow. The flow has to be all ""buys"" with large amounts of premiums being spent on it.

The reason for having this criteria is to find plays where other smart people are expecting the price to increase or decrease significantly, hence the OTM plays only.

Let's go.

# AMC

Let's start with the most famous stock last week with billions of dollars spent on it.  Although this is extremely high risk, there are tons of contracts towards 60-80 strikes for the next 1-2 weeks.  High risk but a lot of possible reward as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ur9lid7ngq371.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3137d3c7796a2a9f43001c28f0a553faf9c4f62

# CLNE

Clean flow here, no puts at all on Friday. Expecting the price to increase by a few dollars by the next few weeks.  Play here is September 17, 13 strike calls.

https://preview.redd.it/te1ouznngq371.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b68bfc3f545df91ba12f12744113ee7b5f7d37

# FUBO

Again, clean flow here towards 28 strike with one trade for the 40 strike.  I like the fact that the sold call was for 28 strike which means that might be the minimum we go next week.  **Play here are 40 calls for 11 November 2021.**

https://preview.redd.it/6hf1za6ogq371.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&s=597dbdd0666f585b85ccf76df784e2ab5b06b249

# ARKK

Plenty of puts flow keeps on coming. Growth stocks are making good moves, so these might be hedged positions, but the flow remains bearish on ARKK. Not super high confidence, but it can act as a hedge if it doesn't work out. **Play here is 107 puts for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/sxmofaoogq371.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c2ec8dc9fe45cb5f41e4761ff0b844cfe094e93

Heavy short term bullish flow here. I'd expect the price to keep increasing throughout the week.  **Play here is 345 calls for July 16th.**

# FUTU

Lots of call buying going on here for the 155 strike. We caught this on Friday, and it has already panned out a bit, but there might still be money to be made here.  **Play  here would be 155 calls for July.**

https://preview.redd.it/iwdns6ppgq371.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fe38aa71bbfce5b6f07879aefeba8f151f7ac61

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment surged another 38% in early deals on Wednesday and were set to open at a record high as individual traders on social media forums were unfazed by a hedge fund flipping its stake in AMC, calling it overvalued.

Hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management sold 8.5 million freshly issued AMC shares at a profit on Tuesday, a source said, immediately after buying them. AMC had earlier said it was prepared to make acquisitions with the new issuance, worth about $230.5 million.

Extending a red hot rally, the cinema operator's stock traded at $41.90 on Wednesday, leading gains among the group of ""meme stocks"" including video game retailer GameStop Corp and BlackBerry Ltd that have attracted the attention of small-time traders on online platforms such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.

""It's not rational, but do not bet against it,"" said a Berlin-based trader.

AMC's stock has surged more than 1,400% this year and, at nearly $42, is trading at more than 10 times the median analyst price target.

The number of messages related to AMC on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits rose more than 7% on Wednesday, with most of them reflecting a positive sentiment.

AMC daily stock trading volumes in the past week have reached their highest since January, according to Refinitiv Eikon, while data from Fidelity showed it continued being the brokerage platform's most traded scrip.

GameStop was up 4.5% in premarket trading, while Koss Corp jumped 13%. BlackBerry's U.S.-listed shares were last up 18.6%, bringing their total yearly gains to more than 75%.

I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar. I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. So when there were then 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).

This third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week (on the spike up to $36) ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so that then made me think I was going to be missing out on all the continued price drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise if I didn't cover then.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to see it go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing my current losses in a few steps for nothing.

So now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and the couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now. My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out.

My reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short positions and they're not always available... and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through, rejected for market unavailability. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees the stock as being in a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now.

No I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify.

IDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses.

I do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary, and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COVID concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and deserves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option.

Anyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting.",2021-06-01,6,85

nogja2_GS,GS,A backtested algorithm for trading meme stocks – 366% on AMC in just under 2 months and 16 trades,"**Introduction**

I recently started working as a contributor on sentimentinvestor’s open source software and I decided to start building algorithms using the data. Given the recent AMC mania I’ll share one that spun a huge return in just under a couple of months. 

For non-devs, I’ll explain conceptually how you can do something like this. For developers, I will also show how to implement this, but (for obvious reasons) I won’t share the codebase, if you want to know please message me (I just don’t want to disseminate it publicly as I want to continue trading with it).

**Also as there is confusion: the model obviously was tested on data that was not used to make it.**

**The Concept** 

I used social media activity (i.e. number of posts, comments etc) from various places to input the data. I suspected (and now confirmed) that activity to some extent preempts price changes for meme stocks. 

While the platform has some better (more precise metrics) for volume, I decided to go for RHI, which is essentially in their words “how much as stock is being talked about compared to usual”. Its calculated by taking the total activity in the past day and dividing by the average daily activity of the past week. 

I chose this metric because it is very clean, although it loses information. 

I compared the graphs of RHI and stock price for various meme stocks and I saw a clear pattern which I decided to build a strategy around. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x59w0atlqa271.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81dc81d3b21a3830ebb2f4c61b4fb96073879729

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4k34hpkmqa271.png?width=868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26bbb7d889edc9880c915b892b924e2db7a5a98

Here the first graph is RHI and the second is price. Notice the surges around May 13 and of course May 23, the dip around the start of may, peak a couple of days ago and so on

Step 0 (for algotraders only) – clean your data: I used the Sentipy Python module to download historical RHI data. I then cleaned it. I used a simple method of converting RHI datapoints into deltas. RHI comes with an hour on hour granularity so I compared the RHI to what it was a couple of hours ago and saw if it went up, this was stored as a 1, if it decreased it was stored as a 0. 

This gives you a chain of 1s and 0s. This looks something like 00000010000011111111010011111111. Here you can see 2 distinct chains of 0s and 1s with some noise. You need to remove this noise. 

Honestly, how you clean your data is not that important, the above method is primitivebut effective. 

**Step 1: Identify stationary points in RHI**

While the stationary points are consistent we can do better by indentifying points of inflection – as this will give us even more warning. You do this by seeing when the direction of the graph is changing. Sometimes this will be obvious like in the above RHI graph you see around May 23/24 there is a clear inflection point. Of course you would only know this a few hours later in case it is noise. You can set your tolerance for noise as quite low because RHI is very clean. In fact I set mine for only 5 hours as you would have cleaned all the noise. 

**Step 2: Buy or sell**

Now all that’s left is buying and selling when you have set your stationary points. This gave me 16 trades over around 2 months. Of these 15 have been successful yielding about 183% on just buy/sell and double that on margin. 

**End notes**

I have tested this on other meme stocks and while yields have not been as high (the last AMC trade I made yielded 88%) they have been great. I have not tested this on stuff like $AAPL or $GS and I doubt it would be as effective. 

Algotraders take note! - you can make more accurate decisions with less noise tolerance although conversely you get fewer trades in. I tried with a few different scales and they all yielding nearly the same thing. Having said this, the fact that this works macrocopically and at a greater granularity is exciting. 

**Challenges**

Making this work better- since we use RHI which is fairly abstracted we lose information so to speak. Using AHI or raw platform breakdowns have the potential to be even more profitable. If anyone plans on making something like these please hmu as I am interested to see where that could go.",2021-05-30,302,83

nnxpec_AMC,AMC,"Plays on high IV, Memes & AMC","Fair warning, this post is meant to be heavy to digest and some mental fatigue is expected in order to follow along.

The setup: meme stocks are once again pumped (AMC, GME, BB, PLTR, ..). I can't time the peak, but I'd like to make some money on the trip down. Except IV is now through the roof, and when it will inevitably crash, whatever options you bought will loose out on value. It's tricky to find the right play. So let's go through all the different plays we could make and how they compare.

# Assumption

Let's stick with AMC. I'm looking at June 18 expiration options, expecting AMC to be in the $10-$20 range by then. Rally might continue next week, or crash and burn, but I am optimistic 3 weeks from now things should have normalized. Let's build a strategy around that.

# 1) Short stocks

This is the easiest if you time the peak well. An absolute nightmare if next week the rally reignites. It is a) heavy on margin requirements b) has no cap on losses -> **HUGE NONO. Always have a cap on your losses.**

(For those who can't short stocks but can still buy options: replace shorting the stock with synthetic shorts. Tastes just the same.)

# 2) Short stocks + long protective call

AMC closed at \~$26. A $30 strike call costs \~$6.50. So we could go short on 100 shares, long on one $30 strike call. Max loss potential of 100\*$10.5. Expected win, in the very lucky scenario AMC goes to $10, is  100\*$9.5. That's very slim returns on a relatively big potential loss.

Problem of course is the expensive protective call. IV is too high, remember? **We should avoid going long on calls.**

# 3) Long puts

So how about buying puts instead for that sweet, sweet leverage?

(OTM) $20 put goes for $3.65, so breakeven below $16.35 by June 18. Max loss 100\*$3.65. We won't score big, even if AMC trades at 15$ (and that's a 42% drop that can't exactly be guaranteed). But it still offers better odds and better max loss than the previous considerations.

(OTM) $15 put goes for $1.38, so breakeven below $13.62 by June 18. Max loss 100\*$1.38. This would require exceptionally great likelihood for AMC to trade below $13.62 to make it worth the risk. With the assumption of AMC trading between $10 and $20, the $20 put is clearly a better choice.

**So the problem here is the high extrinsic value of the option we need to pony up for the trade. Again, high IV - ruins everything.** Maybe deep ITM options do better?

(ITM) $40 put trades at $18.85, breakeven below $21.15 - pretty good pick for our $10-$20 target. Max loss however is also much bigger now: 100\*$18.85 per contract. The extrinsic value on the contract is $4.85 - still crazy high. The delta on these puts is -0.53. For something that is supposed to be deep ITM, that is extremely problematic.

If AMC hits $15, we make $6.15/share, so an ROI of 32%. But it's quite capital heavy, and max loss is also significantly higher. Once again, problem is the high IV and having to pay huge extrinsic costs -> **going long on puts is so-so.**

# 4) Theta/Vega plays

Going long on calls or puts have huge extrinsic costs - so why not take the other side of the deal and short them? With time passing, the option contract will loose value (theta play). Same if the IV drops (vega play).

Selling naked calls is clearly dangerous, so how about bear call spreads.

A $25 (short)-$30(long) Call spread gives us net credit of 100\*$1.20, max loss of 100\*$3.8. Anything below $25 and we keep the credit.

A $30 (short)-$35(long) Call spread gives us net credit of 100\*$0.87, max loss of 100\*$4.13. Anything below $30 and we keep the credit. That is some excellent looking return for an OTM spread.

Odds are, with IV dropping, these credit spreads will become worthless extremely fast and we can close the deal out.

Similarly, we could play put spreads, but returns are pretty bad. A $10 (short)-$5(long) Put spread gives us net credit of 100\*$0.23, max loss 100\*$4.77. Given that AMC was trading below $10 for most of the year, that seems disproportionately risky.

**Credit spreads. The best play in high IV meme stock situations.**

# 5) Theta/Vega play + Iron Condor

Pretty much as before, just combining credit spreads with put spreads to get an iron condor. If one of your spreads goes under, the other one is at least 'safe', reducing your max loss. However, in this case both Put and Call spreads should net similar credits - otherwise the risk is disproportionate towards one side or the other. Sometimes, this is ok. But with the expectation of a $10-$20 price target, put spreads are really not worth it, making this majestic metal bird unpractical here. **Pass, this time.**

# 6) Modeling probabilities & doing the math

We covered a lot of ground, and some of these plays are pretty decent. Normal people would probably stop here. But not us ;)

When IV is so high, options are priced as if anything could happen. The $40 strike call has a \~0.5 delta: as in, there's a 50% chance AMC will trade above $40 by June 18. That seems terribly ill priced.

If you plot the [option-implied risk neutral distribution](https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-publication/2004/rf-v2004-n1-3925-pdf.ashx), you'll get a big, fat curve that sees AMC closing below $10 just as likely as it is to close above $30. In contrast, I am doubling down on my belief that the 'real' expected distribution should be between $10-$20, with about 90% probability. Or if you were to plot these things and slap numbers on it:

[Risk Neutral Distribution vs My prediction](https://preview.redd.it/k41f3294q4271.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee9252d6596dee5783560ec80bc78d2b7b5ddbb)

The cool thing about distributions is you can calculate exact expected returns and win probabilities, instead of eyeballing these values. **These expected values are based on my prediction of the distribution - if I am completely ducking wrong about it, so are these numbers.** In other words, the math is always correct, but the human behind the forecasting can be an idiot. Expected call returns (if going long; if big red negative number, go short for profit):

[AMC June 18 Calls expected returns \(if going long\)](https://preview.redd.it/2orl2y6hs4271.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea779065f644ccccc5499180145e418b076bd35)

Expected put returns (if going long; if big red negative number, go short for profit):

[AMC June 18 Puts expected returns \(if going long\)](https://preview.redd.it/8lgl1g70t4271.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=971dc651be1c81a8650d45c2dd1160e12dba749f)

.. which makes picking the best Put spread so much easier. Picking something green for long leg, something red for the short leg. This way, both legs have overall positive expected returns, but combined for better risk adjusted returns.

The $31 (long) $16 (short) put spread for example for a cost of \~100\*$9.56, expected return of 100\*$2.52, expected ROI 26% , with a 79% of the trade expiring in the positive. Decent trade.

# Conclusion

The main lesson to take away is, when IV is meme-level high, about the only thing certain is that it will come back to normal eventually. Smart money is in trying to take advantage of it. So at the very least, avoid going long during high IV, or get exposure to the underlying via directly buying/shorting stocks if possible.

Common sense can help pick the right option strategy for the right moment, but it's a tedious mental exercise. But for best returns, you probably need to code up your own scripts/deep dive into statistical modeling. I don't think it's really necessary - what matters most is to get the price target and timeframe right. But it certainly helps.

When do you actually cash in your shares during the big POP to get the maximum return? That answer depends on how many shares you own.

GOOD ADVICE: don't sell on the way up, sell just after the peak.
The problem is, we have no idea what the actual real peak will be. 

There will be fake outs, over and over again, think of it as steps, but you don't know how many steps there are. We also don't know how many days or weeks this will take to unwind.

If you only own a few shares, your best bet is to wait for a high number you like and go for it. Possibly leaving 1 share to see how high it goes.

If you own a large number of shares your better off spacing out your cash in point over different price points. That way your chances of getting a good price is much higher.  Leave a few shares in just to see what happens.

THE BIG UNKNOWNS:
1) how long the process will last, days, week's?
2) how high the price will go.

Just to restate, this won't be resolved in a single day. Expect a long drawn out crap show.",2021-04-21,12,44

maip2o_AMC,AMC,AMC; Fundamentals and the Long Term play," Hi everybody and thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. This DD will be dedicated to the long term growth potential of AMC and why I believe it is undervalued. As I was writing this, a lot has happened as such I will going through the mathematics and speculative valuation as well as in my opinion suspicious price action, as relevant to the long term potential of AMC currently; as well as try to reassure investors by clearing up a lot of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) regarding the stock moving forward. All of this is my opinion, and my opinion alone of course, and not financial advice.

With that being stated; lets dive in:

This DD will be composed of the following sections:

i) Fundamentals

ii) Sentiment

iii) Momentum

iv) Consolidation

v) Future potential

vi) Bonus section: Connection to the Short Squeeze

\----FUNDAMENTALS----

So, let's begin with AMC's history:

AMC is a 100 year old company that is deeply embedded into American culture. Entertainment, movies and outings with friends and family has always been a top priority for people (globally). Making an investment into the nations largest theater chain is a bullish and potentially a highly profitable investment. Founded in the 1920s, out of Kansas, AMC offered its first IPO in the 80s which kick-started its growth to become Americas largest theater chain to this day. The price for AMC began to become undervalued in 2012, and as such sensing an opportunity Wanda ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Group)) bought a majority stake in AMC, making Wanda the largest theater chain in the world. As such, AMC became a very stable company with a natural bullish outlook with major blue chip investors having large stakes in the company. Furthermore in 2016, Adam Aron was appointed the CEO in January and by May made moves to successfully acquire AMC's largest competitor Carmike Cinemas, successfully integrating it into the company and thereby cementing it at America's largest theater chain. In September of 2018, Silver Lakes Investments made a 600 mill investment into AMC, buying back approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class B common stock. Wanda continues to this day to hold the majority on the board of directors though. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres))

In October of 2019 AMC began its streaming service to compete with Netflix and co by starting to rent out films and even offering digital purchases via AMC Theatres On Demand. Just shortly after the premiere rumors of a new virus began to circulate in Wuhan in late November. The plague then hit America during February with the first cases, and by March the country was shut down and AMC had 0 in income coming from all theaters. Despite their core business grinding to a halt AMC raised almost over 2.2 billion dollars to my knowledge to date to stave off bankruptcy, as confirmed by the CEO ([http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC)).

Additional sources, documenting cash raising throughout the year are given below:

([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html),

[https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/](https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/),

[https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/))

AMC has completely avoided bankruptcy which should conclude its all-time low share price phase. Furthermore, it must be noted the CEO Adam Aron, has been quite skilled at handling crisis after crisis for AMC, whether its keeping AMC relevant despite pressure from streaming services or surviving a pandemic. The current CEO is a big part of why I believe AMC has immense growth potential. In addition to that the potential revenue from postponed blockbuster like Top Gun Maverick or Marvel movie releases from the beginning of 2020 up until now offers great potential for a post-covid recovery play. Even now relatively small releases such as Tom and Jerry see theatres filled to the legal capacity.

Due to my findings, I believe AMC has rock solid fundamentals of being profitable in addition to a time tested historical track record of being at minimum self sustaining regardless of negative historical events. Like America, it can bounce back from multiple crises better than before.

\-------SENTIMENT--------

At the time of writing, AMC has become a favorite of the average retail investor and the wallstreetbets ""movement"", as such the buying pressure on AMC is quite high; this can be seen from AMCs buy to sell ratio, which sits right now at 92:8. It usually fluctuates from 98:2 to 90:10 at any given time, depending on the volatility of the stock ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)). Over the past two months, AMC shareholders refused to sell despite high volatility, which usually indicates strong belief in the fundamentals. Furthermore, institutional ownership has been skyrocketing with the quarterly inflow of this year being 98M compared to 1.51M in outflow ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)).

Current public sentiment is that AMC is a sure-fire hit, just waiting for launch on both retail and institutional side with Vanguard and BlackRock being the most prominent recent investors. As traditional long-term investors, both companies likely believe that the stock is undervalued, making it an excellent time to take a stake for long-term value increase. ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the\_institutional\_investors\_in\_both\_gme\_and\_amc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the_institutional_investors_in_both_gme_and_amc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).

The compounding effect of higher and higher prices contributes to the bullish sentiment supported by brokerages like fidelity which predict AMC could go up to 1.1k by September ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)). The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

\-----MOMENTUM-----

The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

Furthermore if we look at AMC's competition like Cinemark [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/)), and Marcus ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/)), both of which are smaller companies by both market cap and market share, have a higher share price even if you account for the total amount of outstanding shares; thus indicating higher growth potential for AMC increasing the bullish momentum we've already seen.

As such to end this section off, I believe have proven that AMC's current share price is undervalued and if the projections of fidelity are to believed and the predicted share price is 1.1k+ with the current momentum and buying power ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)), this stock is heavily undervalued, which has been reflected in the recent price action. I believe will continue to rise until the free market finds the correct price again, continuing the bullish momentum.

\-----CONSOLIDATION-----

I'd argue the most important part of a stocks price movement is consolidation. The price consolidation of a stock is defined by the share price effectively finding support at a price point, where in which the price of the stock doesn't easily fall under for a certain period of time. The longer the floor lasts, the stronger the consolidation is generally speaking. In contrast a quick consolidation may indicate a bull run with the price dropping back down afterwards. Quick is of course relative to the volatility of the stock in question, with AMC being one of the most volatile of stocks over the last couple of months a steady increase in share price over the last couple of months could be considered a slow consolidation.

As the definition for consolidation has been established now, lets apply it to the price action for AMC. Using the last 3 sections of fundamentals, momentum and sentiment we can establish that AMC is currently looking for it's ""fair value"" on the stock market. The more consolidation occurs at higher and higher prices, the quicker the share price will rise and find new floors, as the free market tries to find the price for the stock and in my personal opinion it's not stopping anytime soon.

Furthermore, as more retail investors buy the stock, price volatility and volume will increase. With higher volume comes price consolidation which in turn increases the stock price over time. This increasing level of support also directly affects options as more options will expire in the money with each new price consolidation floor. With this additional buying pressure comes volatility that drives the price up, causing more options to expire in the money, shooting the price to new heights. This process will repeat in a positive feedback loop, until the free market/shareholders determines the price of the stock to be fairly valued.

Several companies experienced the same phenomenon like Tesla, Volkswagen and now AMC is currently in the middle of a comparable aggressive price growth feedback cycle.

\-----FUTURE POTENTIAL-----

Now lets cover the rumors of AMC being acquired by either Amazon, or Netflix ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1), [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain)). Lets start with Netflix:

A Netflix acquisition would be different in my opinion from Amazon. Netflix would turn into an extension of its movie network. Netflix has several storylines in development such as ""The Witcher"", ""The dark crystal: Age of resistance"", and ""the The Queen’s Gambit"" have quite high expectations; a more exhaustive list can be seen here: [https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit).

Additionally, Netflix has multiple storylines in development such as Bombay Rose, Dealer, multiple Kdrama's, Get the Goat and other storylines ([https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix)) which will affect Netflix's market value in a positive manner.

Now, that the value of Netflix has been established, I'd like to run a thought experiment regarding the value of Netflix if it acquires AMC, and how the value of Netflix would increase and how if a retail investor (this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just a speculative case study) took a position in AMC currently at its undervalued state, how the retail investor could have the value of his/her position increase overtime in the event of a Netflix acquisition.

Netflix's valuation will increase if they had the largest American cinema chain on top of their entertainment production business. This provides a bigger platform for their entertainment to not only a larger audience, but also adding value to their existing customer base. This in turn, increases the position value of their shareholders. As such, in the case where AMC is acquired by Netflix, I believe the value of the positions in AMC/NFLX will increase. In the context of this thought experiment, as such the result of this thought experiment would be that AMC is currently undervalued in this hypothetical scenario. The value addition to AMC would handsomely reward AMC shareholders and thus would be a good investment (This is not financial advice).

Secondly, let's address the other scenario of acquisition, the Amazon deal. My understanding, many of Amazon's institutional buyers have bought into this; I'll post the source for verification: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/). As such rumors on an Amazon acquisition are not unfounded. I believe this deal will be similar to the deal with ""Whole Foods Market"" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html)), and AMC will become a part of the Amazon ecosystem, with Amazon Prime members having value added to their existing plans. As we've seen with Whole Foods, prior to the acquisition,

Whole Foods Market was receding in a bad market position, losing market share left and right to competitors. However, after the deal with Amazon, Whole Foods Market went through a mini-financial revolution where it was able to re-acquire its original market share. This was done by Whole Foods Market getting access to 2 things Amazon brought to the table: its internet infrastructure and its customer base, as well as immense liquidity of Amazon. This allowed Whole Foods Market to quickly gain back market share; as well as innovate their business. This was done by utilizing Amazon's platforms to increase cost effectiveness. In relation to their business model they increased profits, which allowed them to expand their business, and take back market share at the expense of their competitors. Furthermore, this allowed Whole Foods Market to go from a regional distributor of organic produce to a national grocery chain specializing in organic foods.

This was done, in my opinion, by utilizing Amazon's data-centric business model. Whole Foods Market was quickly able to identify market inefficiencies and use them to gain back market share, while increasing value provided to the customer. This was accomplished through innovation and new business practices, such as faster and more centralized delivery, data intensive business planning, etc. Lastly, Whole Foods Market was able to prove there was a market place for organic fresh foods within an extremely competitive market environment by effectively using the Amazon playbook in the grocery space. In doing so, they took back their market share at the expense of profit.

I believe if AMC were to be acquired by Amazon, it would be a comparable play from there on; i.e. the gaining of market share at the expense of their competitors. They would be introducing new business methods to add value to their customers and shareholders using big data. This can be done in several ways: Amazon may utilize the Netflix model as previously proposed. This can be done by simply substituting Netflix production, development and licensed storylines model with an Amazon Prime one. Amazon Prime has original shows like ""The Expanse"" as well, as well as licensed, developing content like ""Vinland Saga"", ""Attack on Titan"" and ""The Boys"". Sources for Prime video shows are as follows:

i) [https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon](https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon)

ii) [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked)

iii) [https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/](https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/)

Furthermore, as shown with Whole Foods Market, Amazon likes to integrate new acquisition into its ecosystem. In addition to the Netflix replacement deal, AMC customers will be offered further value that will enhance AMC's products such as family and friend bonding time as well as entertainment. This could be done in several ways, in addition to Amazon 5 star restaurants being set up within the cinemas, additional merchandizing rights, prime member discounts, centralization of merchandize and concession stands resulting in, I dare say, cheaper popcorn perhaps; the possibilities for growth are endless. As such, the Amazon scenario can, and I believe, have as much growth potential as the Netflix scenario.

The third scenario; is AMC rebuilding itself to compete with streaming services and offer a better service to its customers. This is also another profitable scenario. Right now AMC is the largest cinema chain in the country; with multiple accredited investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. Furthermore, they have 2.2 Billion cash as stated above; as such they have the ability to innovate without incurring debt. They also have a highly supportive shareholder and customer base, which means there will be strong and perpetual buying pressure. An increase in interest allows them to raise further capital as time progresses as the need arises for innovations. These innovations could be exploring Virtual Reality, or going with a hybrid formula similar to both Amazon's and Netflix's plan is completely up to AMC's shareholders and AMC's board of directors.

However, the purpose of this section was to show how AMC is not just a meme stock (it is, but it also in my opinion an undervalued stock, allowing potential buyers to generate value in their positions, at the current ask price); but an excellent long term hold. As such, I'd like to end this section by saying the following:

Throughout this section I explored the future growth potential of AMC; as such I believe whether it's acquired by a larger company, or forges its future itself, the stock is highly undervalued. The value of this stock will be not determined by any narratives; but by shareholders of AMC, as well as the business itself as it continues to generate revenue for its customers and shareholders.

\----Connection to the Short Squeeze----

This topic is unavoidable; as such I believe it should be addressed head on. As stated in the beginning of this article, this article has been dedicated to discussing the long-term growth prospects of AMC, and why I believe it has immense growth potential. This has been directly shown using mathematics, price and sentiment analysis, why this stock should grow naturally regardless of a short squeeze (to an extremely high price too according to fidelity). As such, this article is to help people who may be doubting their investment in AMC, due to all the fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the stock; as such this article presents a long-term outlook on the hypothetical price action of AMC regardless of the squeeze.

Thus, hopefully, allows people to sleep better at night if they are holding AMC.

Now, lets talk about the squeeze that I know many of you may have on your minds; I stand by my words written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the\_inevitability\_of\_amc\_2k\_based\_on\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the_inevitability_of_amc_2k_based_on_current/), I still believe the price floor for AMC being 2k, especially after the last 2 week's suspicious price actions. To say the least, we have cemented the floor more than ever (plus I said there will be massive FUD from AMC shorters and the Media going forward; one that comes to mind is Motley Fool for instance). However, I'm starting to lean towards the fact that the price floor must be much higher, due to this stock being manipulated at a higher rate (similar to synthetic CDO's back in 07/08 when the housing market exploded). This is still being researched, but I'll leave you guys with a couple sources in relation to GME;

Comments on GME trading halt and the hypothetical price if it wasn't halted:

Here's some proof that GME did almost hit 10k right before trading halts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc\_robinhood\_hodlers\_you\_must\_turn\_off\_instant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc_robinhood_hodlers_you_must_turn_off_instant/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short\_mr\_on\_amc\_200\_in\_questrade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short_mr_on_amc_200_in_questrade/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did\_we\_break\_gme\_9999\_on\_the\_ask\_and\_frozen\_on\_td/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did_we_break_gme_9999_on_the_ask_and_frozen_on_td/reddit)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme\_bidask\_hits\_limit\_in\_tda\_2509999/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme_bidask_hits_limit_in_tda_2509999/)

Now within those links it shows that the margin requirement to short AMC is 200%, and GME was only at 120%; just based on the math, AMC can match if not exceed GME's initial non-halted squeeze of roughly 10k. However, I'm still working out all the math if 10k AMC is viable (I'm leaning to a yes so far though, but I'll keep you guys posted). So I'll be conservative and put the floor at 5k for now upon initial observations. Now, there still must be a lot of math to be worked out guys, so don't take it as straight facts. This is just initial speculation, but I believe the floor may be much higher in the case of a short squeeze at $5k ish. In addition, Fidelity's charts agree long-term this could be a $1.1k+ stock. So it's more than mathematically viable, as I have demonstrated in this article.

\-----Summation----

So to wrap it all up in a pretty bow, I believe the fundamentals, sentiment, momentum, consolidation and future potential of AMC, make it a very strong buy in my opinion.

This has not only been reflected by recent price action and an increase in buy volume, but also accompanied by main street sentiment towards AMC.

I believe this will continue until shareholders determine the value of AMC; thus satisfying the free markets quest to find the true price.

Finally, as customary within my articles, I'd like to leave an appropriate quote or two to summarize the article. Since this article is dedicated to the long-term price action and value of AMC, let's take today's quotes from the ancient past:

""Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed""- Heraclitus of Ephesus.

""It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light"" - Aristotle.

As the wise men of the past have indicated, value is not created over night, it takes patient and protracted effort to create and reward value, however the fruit of the labor is usually sweet; so I believe whenever the price is found for AMC, the shareholders will be rewarded by their patience and effort with sweet profit.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on the price action of AMC, and its future prospects. I hope the rest of your day goes well and you are successful in your endeavors.

This of course is solely my opinion, and not financial advice.

\---TLDR---

For people who don't feel like reading, and apes; the article shows long-term you'll get profit/tendies of a price floor according to Fidelity of $1k+ minimum long-term, as such, if you continue to buy and hold; mathematically you will not only reach tendieland (high profit for those who don't speak wsb), but your tendies (profits) will be nice and crisp.",2021-03-22,50,34

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) ..

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:

**QQQ 2.9%**  
**IWM 3.3%**

The VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.

**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:

https://i.redd.it/scv0hs3hlol61.gif

Options are pricing about a $50 move in either direction for this week, and about a $90 move for the rest of March.

[ULTA](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -3%, +6%, +0%

A note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.

The expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.",2021-03-07,445,129
m019fn_AMC,AMC,Meme Stock or Future Potential? AMC Entertainment,"So like many of us, I've been following this movement with meme stocks very closely wondering if there is money to be made other than just some quick day/swing trades. I've done a ton of research, specifically on AMC because although many expect the ""squeeze"" for GME to be much more likely, the price it's at is very unrealistic and so IF it doesn't happen, then there's not much in terms of future value with a stock already prices that high. Basically it seems much more reliant on a squeeze than anything for your investment. 

AMC I'm looking at with a slightly different view.. yes it is a meme stock, yes it is overpriced at the moment, yes they have been bleeding money due to Covid..

But with all that said, apart from just the ""potential"" for a squeeze, this surge in price they were able to capitalize on and sell shares to raise funds last month to reduce their debt significantly. They also gained an extremely high amount of publicity and sentiment from the public, they have now discussed the option to issue even more shares (which will be kept basically in the war chest by the sounds of it) and I believe they have a very positive plan for them.

These shares can be used for many things, not just in a negative way by diluting shares to raise capital (which if they went this route, I'm sure they would have BIG plans for that money). Instead I think it may be used for positive things like dividends, a stock split or to protect themselves for after the squeeze and avoid a hostile takeover. 

Think about it, the company was in the dirt on the brink of bankruptcy and was/still is being heavily shorted.. why not make the big brain move and reward investors who saved them, and screw over the short sellers who tried to destroy them? Is this not what Tesla did? 

Of course, they are losing money, the Earnings report on Wednesday will show this. But that's not at all what I'm thinking about, investors these days aren't just buying things that make sense from a financial perspective. There is reports and facts backing that up.. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that they will release some big news with plans to grow and thrive long term. Is that a bit speculative? Sure, but they would be very smart to do this while everyone is riding the wave. 

They know they need to make change, thus my thinking of the current price actually a fairly reasonable price point. Not because of the current financials, but because of the sentiment behind what is currently happening and basically the value many are seeing just by holding and having faith that the company will improve its business model and come out with progressive growth ideas for the future. 

I'm NOT the typical meme stock investor relying on the potential squeeze. I am optimistic about the long term potential here, and think the downside risk is actually not as big as people think (unlike GME at its current price). When I say long term potential, I'm thinking maybe $12-15 over the next year or so? Do I hope it can be higher? Of course, but I think that's on the safe side, while my downside price point is around $6. So I definitely see a higher reward vs risk potential in AMC. 

There are plenty of other DD posts around if you are looking for some numbers to back this thought/theory up. I have read all of them, and have come up with this prediction on my own. 

Let me know your thoughts, I'm very open to reasons why this is NOT possible!

A bit ago when AMC was dirt cheap I bought a bunch of 1/21/22 calls $27 strike price.

So would you guys advice maybe selling some of the contracts ITM and holding onto my conviction and riding it out hoping it reopens strongly? Also seeing the CEO give himself a 3.75 MM bonus was awful to see when investors saved them from bankruptcy, so I’m skeptical on their leadership to keep the momentum going. Thanks for any help/input.

EDIT: Thanks for the help guys! And as pointed out, I incorrectly stated ITM which clearly the $27 strike isn’t near that lol I meant they were already profitable some days because the insane volatility and jump in price since I bought.

So I started questioning can AMC get back to 2017 or 2018 levels of stock prices ($14 to $20) or higher?  I am hoping the r/stocks crowd can provide some second opinions (or corrections) to my analysis here.


**Historical Prices**

Looking at AMC's price history in the past 5 years, it was a decline starting 2019 after their first quarter report where it started it's decline and ending the calendar year at around $7 where it started the year at $13.

Considering COVID as extraordinary circumstance, I excluded 2020 as I looked to this.  Pretend that if COVID did not happen what would it have done.

There are others on here where I saw comments that they have been in decline leading up to COVID (2020), so I wanted to see why.  Also I wanted to validate that statement that they were on the downward trend.


**2019 - a special year**

2019 was a special year for AMC's stock prices where it saw it's share price tumble after the first quarter.  Looking at the financials, it is easy to see why.  Looking at their annual balance sheet, you see that their Net Income from 2018 level of $110M went to 2019 level -$149M.  This is a big swing.&nbsp;

Their revenues stayed fairly close between the two years (if any, 2019 went up). So why the drop in Net Income?

*So did AMC end up costing more to operate its business by that much year on year?*

Their Rental and Landing Fees went up by $200M.  
Their Gain on Sale of Security went down by around $90M and their Special Income Charges went down $80M.

*That is a big jump.  What happened in 2019?*

One of the major changes is on how leases are represented in the balance sheet (from my limited understanding of accounting) called ASC 842 where operating leases (which probably represents a big chunk of AMC's balance sheet) will be shown as debt on the balance sheet.  In my limited understanding this means the change in net income if all things are given equal (revenue, actual operating expense etc), net income will be less and importantly EPS as well.  ASC 842 came into effect at beginning of 2019 and the first time it would have shown on the balance sheet would have been first quarter report of 2019 where the share started its steep downward trend on that year.


**So was AMC then making money?**
For this we look at EBITDA or their cash flow.  
Fourth Quarter/Full Year Financial Report from AMC site: Adjusted EBITDA of $269.1M up 11.6% after adjusting 2018 for ASC 842 impact.
So their earning actually went up year on year if we were to compare earnings apples to apples.

Free cash flow (2018 adjusted for ASC 842): 2019 - $303.1M.  2018 - $117.4

That is quite the increase year on year on earnings if reporting methodology was kept consistent.  However, spreadsheet technicality doesn't really give us the whole picture.


**Market growth**

2019 also saw an increase in international markets where it somewhat made up for the decrease in US markets.  However, overall decrease in attendance overall.  Looking at their cash flow statement (which is more a true comparison), their Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by $140M year over year, but their Net Cash used decreased overall hence increasing their cash flow.  While maintaining similar level of screens.  This may mean that their margins were getting better pre-Covid.

If they were to continue the trajectory of international growth (perhaps expansion) and with better margin, they could have done well.


**Comparison with Cinemark**

Picking a cinema operator that lists in North America comparing with Cinemark to see if AMC is better/worse at end of 2019.


Company|2019 No. Of Screens|2019 Theatres|2019 Adjusted EBITDA|Curr Enterprise Value|Curr Market Cap
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
Cinemark|6,132|554|$178M|$5.5B|$2.43B
AMC|11,041|1,004|$269M|$11.72B|$1.9B

You could argue that EBITDA (or earnings) should be proportional to number of screens for a theatre company (and it does seem that EBITDA to screen ratio is similar between the two).  So more screens would mean more earnings as long as the screens are operational.

We however see AMC has twice the EV of Cinemark (with less market cap).  EV being market cap + debt - cash, this would indicate that AMC has a lot more debt.

**Outlook**  

Then the question comes down to has 2020 caused irreparable damage to the business that even if things go back to ""normal"" that they cannot reach the level of earnings?

Currently AMC has Impairment of Capital Asset of $2B in 2020 (compare that to $84M).  This is most likely due to the deprecation of the value of their assets (I mean how much are theatres worth as an asset these days).  If things open back up, the value of said assets should increase hence lessening their expense. Along with it revenue will rise as they open up.

However, to weather the storm, AMC had to take on debt and in turn sale of securities which shows as another hit on their expenses this year.  They will need to make ground on this once things are normal.

Overall, AMC looks like a gamble on if/when things will return to normal.  It would be interesting to see how their partial openings of theatres affect their overall cash flow situation.  Their next earnings call most likely would not contain a lot of good news I would imagine, so at least a quarter after where there is enough data on partial opening (along side what movies are offered) would give a better sense of where it is all headed.

For the next earnings call if there is any data on revenue for partially opened theatre I would look to their attendance to number of screens compared to revenue generated.  Then see if the trend from 2019 onwards has any positive trajectory going towards 2019 levels.  Then once they are fully opened, you can have better confidence their revenue/cash flow to recover.  However, this needs to be balanced with what kind of debt they have and whether that can be reduced.

My current thought is to hold at least until their earnings call to see where this is all heading and re-evaluate my position.  There are other opportunities to throw my money away.

I am also going to look at their 2020 financials more in depth to see if there are any useful nuggets that I can understand better what their plan post-Covid may look like.

*Disclaimer 1:* Lot of the money I put in to stocks are money I essentially are ok losing (gamble of sorts).  Yes, it was foolish of me to get swept up and do a shallow DD before purchasing.  I don't want this to come off as some sort of self validation of holding the stock.  I actually would like feedback on whether there are aspects of the thought process that I need more education on.  My current position with AMC is 200 @ $11

*Disclaimer 2:* My understanding of accounting and its principles are very limited.  I am hoping that there is a subject matter expert on this subreddit to point more things out.

**Edit 1:** As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don’t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float

**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.

**Edit 5:** I’ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC. I’m holding both. The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know. To the moon 🚀🌒",2021-02-10,7611,2307

“
On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.
 
The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.
 
The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:
 
Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.
 
Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  
 
Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.”

ldn0j6_AMC,AMC,"AMC: An imploding time bomb, and put spreads to capitalize","Hi Everyone,

For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how ""big finance"" has already dumped on retail investors, and are about to celebrate big plays for round 2.

Facts-to-date:

1. In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already quietly extracted almost **$1 billion** dollars from retail investors. See [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E) and [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week). These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the Hamptons right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every single AMC share combined was **$500M** two weeks ago
2. Many here have said ""well I don't care, AMC share price is 'only' \~20% above pre-COVID times"" have it completely wrong and are forgetting how many shares AMC have been issued - there are currently \~3X as many outstanding shares, and the current market cap is **400%** of what it was pre-COVID. See [here](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap). Adding to the pain, the moves above added even more shares to dilute the value (though elimination of debt does have some positive EV offset)
3. Unlike GME, there aren't the same conditions for a widespread short squeeze. Short interest between 15-30% depending on how you [count](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) it, multiple funds involved, and plenty of days and liquidity to cover.

**The kicker:** There are BIG incentives to keep prices elevated in the short term. AMC has already stated they're in the midst of considering whether to [issue more shares again and dilute you further](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive/exclusive-amc-entertainment-explores-new-capital-raise-amid-stock-surge-sources-idUSKBN29Y03C), which would be the mother of short squeeze killers.

**The insider conundrum:** What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at Koss who were happy to unload their entire portfolio. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:

1. Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution (e.g., buyback, content plays)
2. Keep the prices inflated and wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them and dump on retail

**The imploding landmine:** Both of these moves would kill both the value of the shares and the potential for a short squeeze simultaneously, and ensure share prices go back to normalized values at $2-$4 depending on the level of optimism for AMC's future

**The play:** Puts on AMC were prohibitively expensive due to IV since last week, but IV has been creeping down drastically as the price flattens. If AMC prices remain stable through Monday - put spreads post earnings should be the way to go, conservative with buying a 6P and selling a 3P

tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where the winners aren't who you think they are

Edit: Getting a lot of PMs... to be clear this isn't an endorsement for/against GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month. It also doesn't depend on others joining the cause or holding the line. Not a financial adviser and will be putting my money where my mouth is.

I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven't shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.

But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.

Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.

Put value: Trading pre-GME sub-3$. While bankruptcy is out of the question, additional stock sales are not. I see this as the major AMC downside argument. 

Call value: While AMC is unlikely to reach peak-GME levels again (20$+), a push to 12-14$ is well within the realm of possibility. AMC is also now set up with a 6$ floor, I see big upside here. 

*Additional Play* Buy AMC sub-6$, sell weekly far-out-of-the-money calls. 

Summary, AMC options are incredibly undervalued right now. Great upside play with limited risk.

Edit: Additional comments. 1. 5% underlying asset move is just my general rule of thumb. It can vary depending on situation. 2. Straddles are a good strategy when the contracts are bargain-priced. If you tried a straddle on AMC when it was trading at 15+ it would be 10x harder to exit because of the volatility premium you paid.",2021-02-02,44,67

Here is the science behind why AMC is guaranteed to AT LEAST hit $300 in the upcoming week(s). Today was only the first day for the hedge funds to cover their shorts. They are going to keep driving down the price using market manipulation techniques; such as the dolphin-dive method, or the ladder strategy. The price will readjust and begin to skyrocket in the upcoming days. Buy more AMC at the dips and hold, hold, hold. Today (Feb.1) , there were more than 10 options called in afterhours from top-tier investors that surpassed $1Million each, that were betting $AMC would hit $100 by the end of this week. These wealthy investors obviously have an inside look of what's going on in Wall Street, and have put their bets on US--the people! There are millions of WSBers and Twitter users who are gearing up to head to the moon and cash out above $300 per share. You do not want to be one of the few people that end up missing out on this historic pay day.",2021-02-02,73,41
lav4vg_AMC,AMC,Current situation with AMC?,"Let me start by saying r/stocks seems a lot more civilized than WSB - I feel like i'll get an informed answer here.

I'll be honest and admit yesterday i got rather excited around the AMC hype and bought 50 shares at 13.50.

Pre-market is looking fairly bleak however with the constant talk of 'ladder attacks' and the short squeeze, should i be feeling fairly confident? As well as this people keep saying that the shorts have to cover by Thursday, is there any actual documentation that proves this, or this is just speculation?

I knew that the investment wasn't an overnight thing and was always happy to play the long-term game.

Again I have to admit that I am a novice and would love an informed insight into the current climate of AMC, is this just the beginning, or has the ship already sailed?

TIA x

lancov_GME,GME,I’m completely sick of seeing GME and AMC posts,"I’m more interested in basically every other stock available on the market at this point. So I really hope to start seeing some DD posts about new companies or existing ones with potentially bright futures. 

I was in amc at 2.41 a week before they took off fully having researched and believing theatres will make a comeback and that that share price was an absolute steal. I was rewarded for this but only by luck, not by AMC themselves. Luckily I’m able to distinguish that and not consider this pure luck as me being some expert investor in my first week of investing

Right now I’m in sundial. It’s a penny, high risk high reward stock. The ceo is making headway toward profitability and that’s really all we can ask for, a ceo who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed= good odds of success in my eyes. All anyone can do is try, sundial is up today in a good way. Hoping to see more good results tomorrow

Just saying though, like the people constantly bombarding with GME posts are seeing a lot of fucking new income, getting high off it and are now just as fucking greedy as wallstreet folks.. like lol.

l9olth_AMC,AMC,AMC Leaps- Any ideas on fundamentals?,"I believe there's a fairly sound case for AMC to bounce back in a significant way beyond the current short squeeze or meme bump. I'm very interested in getting some Leaps on AMC if the IV comes down a bit. Here's my thoughts:

1) Upside: Vaccine rollout. We are probably 3-6 months from normalcy and full reopening. Many studios have been holding back releases from covid-19, and plan to release them after reopening. This could be a recipe for a huge summer box office take, especially considering the desire of my folks to get out and get back to normal.

2) Streaming replacing theaters may not happen as quickly as anticipated. Take a look at the box office of wonder woman 1984. Although it drove a huge bump in subscriptions for hbo, it only grossed $150 million in box office take. The original grossed over $800 million. This seems like a huge incentive for studios to continue to work with theaters. Hard to imagine even Disney doing a streaming only release for a marvel movie and leaving money on the table. Perhaps the studios will raise the value of theaters and form strategic partnerships.

3) Finance: Amc has been able to convert is stock price into a real financial lifeline. They've already raised $300 million and closed out over $600 million in existing debt by selling equity. Considering they had less than $700 million in assets in q2 2020, this is a huge cash infusion and should definitely help them weather the storm door the next few months until business picks back up.

4) Negatives : Real estate value. Theatres are purpose built and hard to offload to raise cash. With few alternative land uses, the value of underperforming theaters in malls, etc could be a liability. Minimum wage is also a big potential threat in the next year, but could be offset with automation.

Any other thoughts? I think calls dated at least 6-12 months out could be a solid play after this squeeze cools off.",2021-01-31,17,24
l97y2y_AMC,AMC,Questions: Why is AMC not rising as much as GME,"Hello,

I have been watching WSB, it's like watching a battlefield, interesting.  But I see that they are stating to hold both GME and AMC stocks.  What confuses me is I don't see AMC rising as much as GME.  I assumed both were being bought in a frenzy.  So I was looking if anyone cn explain to me why AMC is not increasing as much as GME.",2021-01-31,38,43
l918bp_AMC,AMC,AMC next phase:,"Hey all! Copying the text from poster since I cant post images here. 

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30Jan2021): AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target on 1/29 was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.39! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday) 

So Monday when they're forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. Their are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (Wed) 3.2 days (Thurs) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover. 

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short  at $13. The percentage is significantly higher and there's a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

I am just an ape and you do what you want with your money, I am not a financial advisor. I hope this helped some of you understand what's going on.",2021-01-31,1,1

l9ep3q_AMC,AMC,An inside track on why WSB holding on GME and AMC is a good thing.,"*\*\*As a techie working for an investment firm these are my views and opinions*

# Three things all investment firms must do to calculate the exposure & associated with their portfolios.

**HOW IT'S PRICED**

Financial instruments are priced using standard sets of formula ( you can find these anywhere online. )  These formula require in puts like interest rates, FX rates and bond yields as inputs.  To price on any day you use the rate as taken from the market data on that day.  The past is fixed, going back into the historical data will give you the old price.  The present is in motion so your accuracy depends on how quickly you can get the most up to date variables to put into your pricer.  


**SEEING THE FUTURE**

Because the future has not happened, the pricers need predicted trends of data as inputs in order to price future dates.  Whatever the key variables are for your pricer ( rates, yields etc. ) they must be forecast using a predictive model.  Executing the model and generating a future trend allows you to input the future rates of interest into your model.  But one predictive trend of rates is not enough.  You need to run the same prediction thousands of times over and take an average price.

**THE COST OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE.**

Each time a set of future rates are predicted they differ slightly from the previous run.  Each time you predict a set of rates the average on any predicted date changes slightly or a lot.  The amount each prediction differs from the average is called the deviation.  You should stop simulating when you reach a point where the average is only affected by a tiny amount ( for eg. .003% ) .  This is your convergence point.  If you multiply the time it takes to simulate each trend by the number of trend needed to converge you discover the cost of computing the future.  If you need 200K worth of AWS cloud power to predict the next 20 mins to only 70% accuracy then it may not be worth trying to see ahead.   Firms typically produce monthly capital and daily credit exposure reports.  In addition they may forecast PNL 5, 10, 30 years into the future.

# How WSB are scaring the funds and winning their war.

**THE MODEL IS BROKEN!**

The **models used by firms have been around for decades** and the method of forecasting ( Monte-carlo sims or Jump to fusion ) are also decades old.  It's stale.  Hedge fund Chads don't understand the math and they usually employee maths/tech geeks to do the dirty work while the chads cream the largest bonuses in the firms.

**Thanks to WSB these models no longer serve their purpose!!! They cannot factor in a HOLD of epic proportions!**

**THE HUNTERS ARE BECOMING THE HUNTED.**

Fund traders are under pressure to perform, the market has not been generating enough volatility or wealth for their greed.  The current bull run is a product of Trump allowing major corps huge tax breaks, which in turn fuel huge stock buy backs, which in turn fuels the market.  Massive repo lending is rampant to keep the books in the black.  And after seeing indexes rise to unprecedented levels everyone is now poised for the fire-sale!

WSB, particularly on GME, completely turned the strategy on the hunter.  No one can predict what the ""MOB"" will do next.  One wrong step could bankrupt a firm!

**THE FUTURE IS UNWRITTEN NOW.**

The models cannot cope.  Chads cannot produce accurate forecasts because any ticker could be the beneficiary of a unforseen buy frenzy.  WSB is getting between the bully and the victim.  **Diamond fists are landing heavy blows.**  Imagine a 1890s prize fighter standing ""orthodox"", fists out, chin back, *""according to the book""*.  This privileged and arrogant bully has stepped into the ring Roy Jones Junior at his prime! The funds are being made fools of

**THE FUNDS RUNNING TO THE REGULATOR!**

The funds now want the little guy taken out of the game because it isn't fair that the firms don't know how to factor that behavior into their dated business models.  It was OK for the funds to benefit from misery because there was no rule obstructing them from doing that.  But it's not OK for the little guy to simply buy and hold, because that hurts the fund's game.  Shorting is risky with potentially unlimited loss!  But despite that being a known fact, the firms should be allowed to exit the squeeze because ""We didn't mean to lose money shorting!""

In one word HOLD!",2021-01-31,1,1

l8efqp_AMC,AMC,Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,"As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",2021-01-30,8448,1001

l8tr88_AMC,AMC,Practical and actionable ideas for next week -- AMC," Woah. This week was awesome. This post is not about the implications of what the movement might mean. This post centers around my 2 cents for existing, available trading options for someone that wants to get their beak wet or have skin in the game (""I think he's mixing up metaphors""). I'll be focusing on AMC although the principles still apply to GME. I'll try to keep it short.

Quick background: I'm an engineer/quant developer. I like relying on statistics, probabilities, and juicy risk-to-reward trades. I normally sit out of these huge moves, but when i see opportunities that are overlooked, i'll take them. It also helps that I strongly believe in the continuing power shift from the hedge funds to the collective masses, and I would like to part of it.

I'll start with my conclusion: **2/5 AMC Call Debit Spreads** is one of the better available trades this week.

I trade options, I like having a set risk limit for each of my trades. However, when AMC is having 20-70% daily moves, the reward profile becomes less attractive for me. I think most people here are either buying naked options or shares. I think the risk profile for shares is more or less understood, so let's focus on naked calls.

Let's look at this example for a $13 ITM Weekly Call: [https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9](https://imgur.com/a/j5OdIe9)

Because the volatility is so high, AMC would have to move 35% by end of week, just for this contract to break even. One could argue that that is a strong case to be selling premium, and they could be right, but it doesn't fit my personal criteria for having a set risk limit for each trade. The downside for selling AMC premium this week is potentially high and, also, how dare you.

Let's compare this to the $12/$13 Call Debit Spread i took on Friday (and there will most likely be similar trades available this upcoming week): [https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq](https://imgur.com/a/WoIWbxq)

As we can see, the opposite is true. We actually gain value every day that the price holds. I edited the values for the entry because i was able to get filled at $0.20 on Friday, so i'm looking at a 400% gain if AMC closes above 13. Furthermore, my risk is capped at the debit I paid for these spreads.

One of the other benefits is that a naked ITM $13 call will run you > $500 a contract, while the spread was $20 bucks a pop.

Again, this isn't financial advice, just my 2 cents. I'm normally an algo trader with a quant bias, and its hard to model what might happen this week, but I wanted to be on the side of the community while also potentially making a good trade. All this to say, I'm proud of you all. Hope we can hold the line. Cheers.",2021-01-30,44,31

l7hnpf_AMC,AMC,"Actual Reason You can't buy GME, AMC and etc.","Hello Everyone, so first of all, I just listened to the interview that was done by the Webull CEO, which provided a much better explanation on why the stocks are temporarily unable to trade. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM)

The regular trading process:

1. A customer buys a stock/option from a brokerage (which is the platform/customer side of the market)
2. The brokerage sends the information to DTC (basically the custodian and the clearinghouse) DTCC usually requires a collateral of 1-3% of the transaction. This means that if you buy a stock worth $100, your brokerage buys the stock from DTCC for $3 (as a long), since it takes about 1-3 days for the cash to settle.
3. Once the transacation is completed you obtain your shares instantly, but the brokerage will have to send the remaining money 97-99% within 2 business days.

What happened to GME, AMC, and etc.

1. The trade volume skyrocketed and volatility skyrocketed.
2. DTCC became scared and raised the collateral requirement to 100%, basically 33x the capital to DTCC.
3. Assuming the trade volume as of 1/28/2021, 177.8 million shares, that means that the brokerage must now send hundreds of billions of dollars to DTCC every single large trades. DTCC does not have the capital to support it. Melvin Capital does not have the capital to support this.
4. What happens when Melvin Capital goes bankrupt and can't pay for the shorts? Answer: DTCC is obligated to pay for it. Basically making DTCC go bankrupt. What happens when DTCC goes bankrupt, that means the entire US stock market trading goes to a standstill. DTCC has a monopoly of 95% of total US stock trading (according to Webull CEO).
5. That doesn't even take into account the options.

What does this mean: the current market system does not allow such a large number of financial transactions to occur in such a short period and time. In addition, there is a conflict of interest, since DTCC does not want Melvin Capital to go completely bankrupt, since then DTCC might go bankrupt.

1st question you might have: Why does DTCC exist? Answer: when you buy a stock, you buy the street price and not the person quoted price. Otherwise, we could see volatility in the 50%+ forever with the transactions of stocks, since buying would raise the price and selling would lower the price even with a small transactions.

2nd question: What would happen if they don't raise collateral cost? In 2008, Lehman Brothers was like DTCC, they did not raise it fast enough. Basically, the hedge funds that used Lehman Brothers could not sell/buy, since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. This causes a complete market breakdown.

3rd question: Why was Robinhood only allowing selling and not buying? Selling does not require collateral, so that would have been fine. Problem is that it only benefits the shirt-sellers, so they probably should have followed Webull and just halted trading completely.

4th question: What is the worst case scenario? GME keeps rising and it takes a hedge fund completely down, say Melvin Capital. Clearing House DTC will now liquidate the backstop, which is an insurance policy Melvin Capital must buy from another bank or investor firm. If the investment firm goes bankrupt, DTC is expected to pay. If DTC also goes bankrupt, most likely it's taxpayers to prevent trading halt.

**TDLR:** WSB + social media + other hedge funds (definitely some players got into this) almost caused the entire US stock market to halt ALL trading, so the clearinghouse basically changed the rules to prevent that from happening. Basically, they sided with the ""suits""/""wallstreet"", since they could have caused a financial meltdown..........LMAO",2021-01-29,134,125

l7p8z2_AMC,AMC,"GME, AMC: mindless gambling? How does everyone continue when it´s over?","Hey there,

I am new here, so if I do things wrong, please let me know.

Now, I am sure we are all very aware of what is going on with amc and gme. I have some stock market experience and as much as I enjoy the memes, the investing into gme and amc is a bit confusing to me. There is seemingly no fundamental financial background to these companies, meaning imo their financial statements do not look to great. (Financial statements can be viewed here: [https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings))

As far as I can tell, they have been pretty down for some time now and the only reason why they are going up is because people dislike the way Melvin and others were betting on gme´s demise via shorting.

It seems to me as though people are kind of just jumping on it without doing their own research, DD or any other form of ""intelligence gathering"" before they invest. So, aren´t we really just chucking money around here?

Wouldn´t it be more interesting if people managed to find companies that are ""proper"" investment-options? As in, companies that have working assets, healthy financial statements etc... and then invest some money into these companies? I mean, I get it... obviously for the memes is funny, and the prospect of imminent riches through a stock-surge like with gme is appealing, but it just feels a lot more like gambling to me than (predictable) investing. Would it not be more interesting to participate in more sustainable ways of investing into companies?

So instead of finding the next GME or AMC or whatever, how about we unite around actual investing ideas the next time instead of mindless anti-wallstreet gambling? (Please don´t get me wrong, I understand why people are angry). 

Nonetheless it looks like people are busy praying for a positive outcome of their investments, sometimes gaining a lot more and sometimes loosing a lot of their hard earned money. Would it not be nicer to be sure about the positive outcome of your investments rather than producing a ton of uncertainty for one´s money? Obviously it would take a little longer than the explosive stuff that´s currently going on... but I think it would be worth it and much more sustainable.

But that was the case for GME where you really have shortage of stock.

So why the hell did they also restrict AMC, NOK and BB when there was no shortage of those stocks and there was no issue of buying them in any way? It only created rigged market playground where you could not buy the stock only sell, which resulted in massive drop in price. Because what else could happen if you can only sell.

There are about 100 million shares of AMC float. Today, 600 million AMC shares traded. Yesterday, another 600 million, the day before 1.2 billion. Over just the last 3 days, the 100 million shares outstanding changed hands 24 times. And that is if 23 out of 24 holders of each share flipped their shares over the last 3 days alone. What am I missing? And my logic would imply that nobody held their shares for more than a few hours. If they did, that reduces the float which means the shares trade hands even faster.

The idea of settling 2.4 billion shares of AMC in 3 days is staggering to begin with.",2021-01-29,91,83

l5xots_AMC,AMC,AMC Short Squeeze?,"Was thinking of getting balls deep into AMC. Missed the $4 entry (rip I was hesitant af) and planning to get in premarket at $8+. 

I know AMC has a relatively high SI % float, but with the unfolding of a certain stock ,

1. Can large hedge funds/shorters /MMs somehow take a certain course of action to ensure a suppressed squeeze? Is there any possibility ?

2. Also, what are the potential downsides of going into AMC? 

I read the DDs on a certain subreddit about their consistent revenue growth etc. , but they plummeted abit before COVID started and went all the way down during COVID. I can only think of AMC declining if WANDA decides to bail out but given 20% ownership I don’t think so...

l4pidq_AMC,AMC,Good news from AMC,"As I'm sure most of you have heard, AMC stocks soared today, based on news that AMC has acquired enough funds to stay afloat ""deep into 2021"" according to an article. They've acquired ""917 million in debt and equity financing."" During the short interval that the market has been open, I've seen AMC fluctuate from 4.60-something to 4.13. Last time it got this high, it ended up hemorrhaging. That was based on the news of a vaccine, if I recall. But perhaps this rise isn't quite as much a mirage, as it's actually on the strength not merely of expectations and hopes, but an actual, tangible financial development.

So, what do you all think? Is AMC stock going to soar or at least make a steady turn around? One thing I'll say is, they need to actually start putting out movies that bring people to the theaters. And hopefully hammer out exclusive deals that don't involve sharing with streaming platforms. Godzilla vs Kong is on the horizon and perhaps that can rake in some old-fashioned blockbuster numbers.

One of the main things AMC needs to do is raise capitol which it has been doing and will continue to do that. The CEO says the company needs to raise about $750 million to survive covid. Although they haven’t done that yet they still have raised over $200 million within the first two weeks of initially announcing they needed the $750 million. Additionally, AMC is issuing $100 million in notes due 2026. AMC is valued at around $700 million dollars which is reasonable due to the pandemic and lack of revenue. However the most recent earnings report shows that the company produced $119 million in revenue compared to $18 million from the previous quarter which is substantially better. Don’t forget this was a company making around $1.5 billion in revenue per quarter before the pandemic. More theaters are opening as soon as today so it looks brighter for AMC. The vaccine is being delivered to people all over the nation so that will help ease investors nerves as well. If the company can raise enough capitol, open theaters, and get back to making more money gradually of course I don’t see why AMC cant reach $10. Will movie theaters go out of business forever? I don’t think so. What are your thoughts?",2021-01-22,30,21

Tasty? Absurd? Both? 

There’s just no way they go tits up. The pandemic is temporary, people are going to go back to theaters in droves when this shit is over. The industry was profitable for years and absolutely have a path back to that. The major producers are all delaying their feature films because they know they’ll never earn back the production and marketing costs by putting it on some streaming platform that charges $10 a month. Warner Bros is only dropping their 2021 slate on HBO Max and have already said their larger blockbuster films will go back to theater only in 2022.

With a majority of the US expected to be vaccinated by Q3 this year, I’ve got to expect that people are going to start doing the things they were used to doing in 2019. It only goes up from here.

Universal Studios is owned by NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. AMC has 1,000 theaters across the globe.

g3wkxd_AMC,AMC,AMC will be bought out by someone,"**TL;DR** AMC will be bought out by a bigger company or saved somehow. Going to the theaters is too American for the company to fail. AMC is like Boeing or McDonalds or like Hot Dogs. Plus without AMC Disney or Comcast or Universal can no longer hit their Billion dollar revenue mark for their movie releases.

Basically AMC going, maybe, bankrupt will be a no gamer for a bigger company to step in and buy it flat out or at least a huge controlling stake in it

Think about what movies do for Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, DC, Pixar, etc

These are BILLIONS of dollar movie categories.

You think Disney or Universal or Comcast will let AMC hit the shitter? Absolutely not.

Not only do these big companies rely on AMC for marketing, exposure and revenue they provide a place where millions upon millions of people stay up to date and relevant on these themes.

You REALLY think Disney will let AMC go bankrupt instead of buy them out? They need AMC to be relevant and make Billion dollar movies like Infinity War and Endgame.

I’m not saying DISNEY specifically will buy them out but theirs a big chance someone will. Also, Bob Iger, Disney’s former CEO is back on the Disney table for a reason, and my gut is saying to purchase AMC.

If DISNEY buys AMC they would have full control of anything and everything theatrical in the US. More locations to sell merchandise and to create a more “Disney” experience at the movies.

Just my two cents.

Also I bought AMC at $2 and sold Friday on the rally up. Will buy more again this week or if/when it ever does come down again.",2020-04-18,0,23

fo83rh_SQ,SQ,Square (SQ) 3/24/2020 AMC - Need to be Patient,"Stock: **Square (SQ) - 48.30$**

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **50$**

**Type: Short Put**

**Fundamental:** Nothing in Square’s formula has changed since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak. **There is a note that due to the closure of many SMBs, Square’s transaction count will be significantly affected.** Square’s price fell from about 85$ to about 49$ in the span of the first Coronavirus slide, bottoming out at 32$, which was quickly brought up to about the 40$ average. Since then, it has grown alongside the rest of the market. Square will face very little growth for the foreseeable future, but can be a great candidate for covered calls.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD slight shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and Bearish open interest. Implied movement is a whopping 12.1% or about 5.85$ Short interest is at 7.83%, with 5.2 days to cover. Support at \~41$, with 52w high being 87.25$.

**Sentimental**: Square is a company that will not die. While the valuation was rich, Square was primely in the growth category, with its consistent revenue and EPS increases. The current coronavirus selloff has affected every stock on the market and Square was no exception. In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. 

Typically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event’s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays.

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **125$**

**Type: Call Credit spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** OKTA has been a cloud darling since 2017, with the stock exploding in 2018. Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA’s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. 

**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. 

**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK’s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140’s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop.

fahpbb_SQ,SQ,"Autodesk (ADSK) 2/27/2020 AMC - Beats like SQ, but whats next?","Stock: **Autodesk (ADSK) - 185.02$**

Direction: **Neutral**

**Price Target:** **180$**

**Type: Call credit spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Autodesk is the leader of its industry for 3D product design. While it encompasses many sectors, Automotive and Construction are two of its largest product service segments. Homebuilding experienced a boom late last year, as shown by performances of Zillow, Redfin, HD, Lennar, KBH and more. It’s currently trading off a 210$ high just a few weeks past, skewing its technical data. ADSK has strong free cash flow, which lessens the risk of burnout.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50day moving average, and above 200D moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, oversold. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.2% or about 13.34$ Short interest is very low.

**Sentimental**: Autodesk is a product category leader with a consistent track record of growing revenue and improving efficiency. This is a deadly combo, as lack of competition is similar to a product moat. I believe Autodesk has a very strong mid to long term case, but short term positive sentiments can be heavily affected by current macro negatives. Looking at SQ’s performance yesterday, ADSK may beat, but will be negatively affected by the market. ADKS’s guidance will be the make or break factor for this earnings.

**ROI : 15.1%, 30%**

**Risk Level - 4 of 5, Risky, 5 of 5 Manage it.**

The idea is that if ADSK pops, macro will push it down. If it dumps, the bottom might be much lower due to current macro conditions. This one is close, similar to Etsy and SQ. Careful.

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **80$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread** 

**Fundamental:** Square has been growing very quickly and maintains its growth velocity through new product innovation and more market share capturing. SQ also lowballed EPS and Revenue guidance last quarter, making this quarter much easier to beat. However, with the global slowdown due to coronavirus, forward guidance will become very important. Square cannot sandbag guidance this quarter as any weakness shown will be exposed. 

**Technical**: Priced above 50 and 200 day moving averages, below 20D average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, neutral. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 8.6% or about 6.64$

**Sentimental**: Square is looking to massively beat EPS and Revenue, and is set up to guide even higher in 2020. The key concern here is the public perception and intense macro fear. **This large negative macro will affect positive earnings negatively, as it prevents a lot of buyers from jumping due to macro fear.** All things aside, square should come out of the earnings on top, but we don’t know how the market will react to a win. 

**ROI : 20%**

**Risk Level - 3 of 5, Risky**

**Close fast if profitable. Square has a very consistent tendency to go lower regardless of earnings the week after.  Sell call credit spreads a week further out if you know how.**

f9eoif_AMC,AMC,Virgin Galactic (SPCE) 2/25/2020 AMC - FEELS > REALS,"Stock: **Virgin Galactic (SPCE)**

Direction: **Mixed Bullish**

**Price Target:** **40$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread, Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** lol

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, no 200D average yet.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 72, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bullish open interest. **Implied movement of about 23% or 8.05$. Short interest rate is 19%, about 1.15 days to cover, and about 37% of total available float is shorted.** SPCE is currently considered “hard to borrow”, putting pressure and fees on short sellers. **19% institutional ownership = much more sentiment and retail driven.**

**Sentimental**: There are several key factors at play for SPCE’s earnings this quarter. The first factor is the updated timetable regarding commercial flights. Previously, SPCE stated that first commercial flights will begin Q1/Q2 2020. **If the flight timetable is reinforced or even confirmed, it can be a very strong catalyst to keep the stock up.** Second factor at play is the revenue accrued from reservation deposits. **In September 2019, SPCE annouced they have 600 tickets sold, amounting to about 80M in revenue. As of 2/24/2020, SPCE’s website noted that all tickets have been sold out.** While a 750k revenue on 7.3B market cap seems dumb, the accrued revenue from reservations would be the biggest factor in the operational performance area. The last factor at play is the **potential for SPCE to announce an equity raise given the stock’s current high price.** **Depending on the price and shares released, it can materially affect the stock’s price downwards**. A 4th issue was concluded merely yesterday, as **SPCE finally registered its warrants.** This prevents a cashless exercise scenario, which would hurt the stock price due to a brief, but massive influx of shares. While total dilution would be smaller by 12 million or about 60%, a cashless exercise will wreck the short-term float. 31 million shares over the course of 5 years is much more manageable. One last factor is the current macro psychology**. Because we are near the tail end of the longest bull run in American history, traders are looking for even more aggressive trades to pull even higher returns.**

The question for this earnings is entirely a retail fueled sentiment show. If SPCE can keep up the retail hype through news and announcements, it can lead retail to stay stubborn with price action. In addition, since most of the price is driven by retail purchases, price action will reflect much more of the sentiments, rather than anything logical. Chance of a sustained short squeeze is almost nothing due to 1.15 SI Ratio.

**ROI : 31%, 98%**

**Risk Level - 5 of 5, Educated Gambling.**

f6xhl7_ZS,ZS,Zscaler 2/20/2020 AMC - Guidance matters most.," 

Stock: ZScaler **(ZS)**

Direction: **mildly bullish** 

**Price Target:** **65$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** This stock is a great example of a growth stock. Fundamental ratios such as PE, sales to earnings, cashflow etc are all way out of reasonable ranges. However, we’re also looking at 35% revenue growth year over year, and the industry is extremely bullish due to the shift into cloud and digital. Looking at comparable peers using Price to sales, we can still say ZS is relatively overpriced even amongst its peers. This is primarily a bet on further growth potential of the company, hence the growth categorization.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 68, nearing overbought, but turning downwards. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 10.1% or 6.31$.

**Sentimental**: Zscaler is the best-in-class for cyber security and has superior product selection and features vs competitors like palo alto networks. It has accrued a decent short interest of about 9% float and 6 days to cover approximately. While ZS has beaten earnings since its IPO, the stock price tends to hang over on guidance due to the growth nature of this stock. Given the short interest, if the stock trends flat or upwards, we should see some minor short covering. 

**ROI: 20%**

**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**

4i5fpc_AMC,AMC,AMC vs CKEC,"I have owned AMC for around a month and am looking to hold long. I don't have a price target, but I like their prospects with increasing concessions sales and more movies with huge draws slated for the near future (namely the Marvel universe, Star Wars, and hopefully more Jurassic Park). I am very interested in Carmike Cinemas as well. I think they are undervalued, but it's always harder to tell with those that aren't turning profit.

For background, Carmike had been trading at around $25 a share until the news of a potential AMC merger at $30/share came out, which immediately boosted the stock to around 30. The current climate at CKEC is one of discontent. Most shareholders want between $33 and low 40s for their shares. I see this as a potential risk for AMC (the $30/share deal will cost approx. $1.1b, most of which is debt-financed, so a raise will be costly).

Basically at this point I am trying to weigh whether the buyout, which will make AMC the largest cinema chain in the world and thus give it better leverage for revenue splits, while unlocking monster southeast potential from CKEC and eliminating most of the support services of Carmike and rolling it under the AMC roof will be worth the potentially higher price of the merger. If the Justice Department clears the merger, AMC would likely have to close between 8 and 15 cinemas, which is a pretty negligible number. Anyone have any advice on how to gauge this? (I'm a noob)

EDIT: My options are as follows:

1. Hold AMC, which is probably what I should do if I think the merger will go through at $30/share or the deal falls through altogether.

2. Hold AMC, buy CKEC, which may be an awful plan, I'm sort of new to this. I would probably do this if I think Carmike shareholders will get paid $35 or better, netting me a 16.67% return over what would probably be about the rest of the year (per both boards' timelines)

3. Dispose of AMC at an ordinary, but negligible gain, buy CKEC. This would likely be if I thought CKEC shares will be paid $35+ and I think the cost of the merger will outweigh the benefit for AMC over the duration of my holding or to the point that I can rebuy for cheaper than I have now after a Carmike payout.",2016-05-06,3,2

1skfao_AMC,AMC,Thoughts on AMC IPO?,"I know there was a thread about this but I just did a little research and wanted to share what I found.. I also wanted to hear any other opinions and advice. Thanks!


I will most likely stay away for a week from IPO to let things calm down.. but I think the Wanda Group merger makes it clear that the IPO is to raise money to move into the Chinese market! They already have 2 theatres in Hong Kong and have indicated that they are distributing $182.2 million in growth projects. This would be huge for AMC and although streaming is big, cinemas will most likely remain very popular. They are even beginning to come up with unconventional ways to bring in customers (ie. airing full seasons of BB and Walking Dead)..  


I dug through some of their IPO filings..

/r/investing is constantly bombarded with things such as  
""Sim City/Diablo 3/PS4/GTA V/Etc is coming out, should I invest in X company? I think its going to be very successful, and the stock will pop""
