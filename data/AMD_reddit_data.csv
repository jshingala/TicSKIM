1kxb4mg_AMD,AMD,Why isn‚Äôt AMD getting any love for AI stocks when it‚Äôs basically the only real rival to NVIDIA?,"Hey y‚Äôall,

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwhen it comes to AI-ready GPUs, it‚Äôs just NVIDIA and AMD. No one else even comes close. Yet every time someone talks AI stocks, it‚Äôs always NVIDIA this, NVIDIA that, and AMD barely gets a mention. Meanwhile, AMD‚Äôs Instinct MI300/MI350 cards are delivering solid benchmarks, ROCm support is finally shaping up, and plenty of datacenters are kicking the tires on AMD hardware.

Is the CUDA lock-in so massive that devs and investors just can‚Äôt look past it?

Or are we sleeping on AMD‚Äôs software maturity, marketing reach, or even analyst coverage?

At this point, is AMD actually close enough to steal some of NVIDIA‚Äôs thunder?


What am I missing here‚Äîwhy isn‚Äôt AMD a bigger AI stock play? Appreciate your thoughts!

1krh3sj_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk¬†said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants¬†Nvidia¬†and¬†AMD, and possibly others.

Musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the¬†Tesla¬†CEO told CNBC‚Äôs David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said.¬†

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

‚ÄúA few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,‚Äù he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of¬†Tesla.

At his autos business,¬†Musk said Tesla‚Äôs Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI‚Äôs Colossus is the ‚Äúmost powerful training cluster in the world right now‚Äù with ‚Äúover 200,000 GPUs training coherently.‚Äù Musk‚Äôs choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as¬†transforming¬†the region¬†into a ‚Äúhigh-tech manufacturing hub.‚Äù

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously¬†reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely ‚Äúviolated the Clean Air Act‚Äù and local permitting requirements for ‚Äúmajor sources of air pollution‚Äù with its use of the turbines.

I also understand a several billion dollar buy back project is ongoing which got announced this morning. But does it really merit a 20% run-up on a multi-billion dollar company? I understand people believe AMD is undervalued compared to NVDA. But don‚Äôt you think the undervaluation is somewhat merited due to NVDA dominating the current AI space? Are investors really banking on NVDA not being able to keep up the AI dominance and having AMD slowly chip away at the market share/piece of the pie? Is AMD really banking on increasing their 2nd place spot by hoping and praying the 1st place spot lags or falls behind? 9/10 smart investors should take NVDA over AMD simply because of their numbers. Their business is better, the numbers are better, hello? AMD investors are hoping and wishing that they can keep this whale in its fishing rod, but it‚Äôs dragging the whole boat. From a rational standpoint, AMD is way too close to NVDA on the podium. NVDA should be #1 by 10x. AMD can‚Äôt keep up. And if investors acted with their rational mind, they would pick the clear winner-picker choice - and not a choice based off a prayer or hope.

1kgb77y_META,META,AMD Bull Thesis Heading into Q1 Earnings,"Hey everyone, heading into earnings, I wanted to share a full thesis I‚Äôve been working on for AMD. I know some have been burned, but I believe a real turn around is due, and there is really good value at these levels. It‚Äôs a detailed look at how the company is positioned structurally in 2025 and why I believe the market is still mispricing the depth of its data center strategy.

From Q4:

* **Data Center revenue**: $3.86B, up 30 percent year over year
* **Client revenue**: $2.31B, up 58 percent year over year
* **Gross margin**: 54 percent non-GAAP
* **Free cash flow**: $1.09B
* **MI300 expected to generate over $3.5B in 2025**
* **Demand visibility already extends into 2026**

The Meta partnership is a key signal here. AMD's MI300X accelerators are being deployed to run Llama 3.1 405B entirely in a single server using 192GB of HBM3 memory. That kind of footprint matters for inference efficiency, cost optimization, and system complexity. It is also the kind of deployment that validates the MI300X design in a real-world, high-scale environment.

Inference is often underappreciated in these conversations. AMD is not just aiming for training wins. The MI300X architecture was built for high-throughput inference, and paired with ROCm 6, they are closing key performance gaps. Benchmarks already show major latency improvements on models like Llama 2 compared to prior gen Instinct accelerators.

This is where the structural argument starts to take shape. MI300 is rolling out across training, inference, and high-density memory workloads. EPYC CPUs are still gaining traction across HPC and cloud compute. And the embedded segment, while cooling off, remains steady across aerospace and networking.

This is not about catching Nvidia. It is about building a diversified base that generates leverage across the full stack of data center infrastructure.

I believe inference will allow AMD to grow massively with the capex spend on AI in GPUs, and also stands to significantly grow its CPU business, as customers seek a one partner solution.

1kgc2e3_NVDA,NVDA,Everything about AMD's earnings tonight,"Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump‚Äôs tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA) earnings later this month.

For those who have been paying attention, AMD‚Äôs announcement follows rival Intel‚Äôs (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the ‚Äúcurrent macro environment‚Äù for creating ‚Äúelevated uncertainty across the industry.‚Äù

PC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump‚Äôs tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department‚Äôs Section 232 investigation.

For the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.

In April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD‚Äôs ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company‚Äôs Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek‚Äôs January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions.

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD‚Äôs Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There‚Äôs the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD‚Äôs gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft‚Äôs (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren‚Äôt exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it‚Äôs raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

1kgfkpa_AMD,AMD,AMD earnings beat as overall sales surge 36%,"Advanced Micro Devices¬†reported¬†first fiscal-quarter earnings¬†on Tuesday that topped expectations, and provided a strong forecast for current-quarter revenue.

Shares of AMD rose more than 4% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended March 29:

* **Earnings per share**: 96 cents adjusted vs. 94 cents expected
* **Revenue**: $7.44 billion vs. $7.13 billion expected

For the current quarter, AMD expects about $7.4 billion in sales with a gross margin of 43%, versus Wall Street estimates for earnings of 86 cents adjusted on $7.25 billion in sales.

AMD‚Äôs forecast also included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S.¬†limited the export of some of the company‚Äôs artificial intelligence chips¬†during the quarter.

The company reported net income of $709 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, versus net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 36% on an annual basis.

AMD is the second-place server central processing unit vendor, behind¬†Intel, but its Epyc line of processors has been taking market share in recent years.

The company is also¬†the closest competitor¬†to¬†Nvidia¬†for ‚Äúbig GPUs,‚Äù or graphics processing units. Those are the kind of chips that are deployed in data centers by the thousands for building generative AI. It did $5 billion in AI GPU sales in the company‚Äôs fiscal 2024.

Both are reported in the company‚Äôs data center segment, which came in at $3.7 billion in sales, topping a StreetAccount estimate. Data center sales were up 57% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.

The company‚Äôs other major segment, Client and Gaming, includes chips for consumer devices such as laptops, gaming PCs and game consoles. The overall segment rose 28% on an annual basis to $2.9 billion. AMD said sales for its laptop and PC chips, which it calls client revenue, surged 68% year over year because of strong demand for chips called Zen 5 that the company released last summer.

Gaming sales, however, declined 30% on an annual basis, which the company attributed to a decrease in console chip revenue.

AMD‚Äôs embedded segment, which is mostly sales from the company‚Äôs 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, declined 3% on an annual basis to $823 million.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek‚Äôs January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions.

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD‚Äôs Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There‚Äôs the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD‚Äôs gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft‚Äôs (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren‚Äôt exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it‚Äôs raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

One of the most interesting will come from AMD, Advanced Micro Devices. Personally, I am bullish on this one but with all the uncertainty plaguing US and global markets, there is an easy case to be made for movement in either direction.

The being said, for all you bulls out there, we like a target of 140 on the upside. This comes from multiple analysts at Piper Sandler, BOCOM, First Shanghai Securities, Fubon Securities, Roth Capital, and Raymond James.

Using this strike, the best trade we found is a 130/145 Call Spread, expiring in July.

1k637a3_AMD,AMD,AMD analysis,"I've been analyzing AMD's situation, integrating KPI data from Value Sense to provide a comprehensive view of the company's trajectory and future prospects.

AMD Stock Analysis: Is it Time to Move On?

I've been closely following AMD's trajectory since early 2024, and the current situation warrants a thorough assessment. Despite the continued AI acceleration boom, AMD's stock has declined nearly 30% this year and struggles to regain momentum even as demand for AI hardware remains robust.

KPIs (via [Value Sense](https://valuesense.io/ticker/amd/financials)):

* Revenue Growth Trajectory: Total revenue expanded from $5.5B (2014) to $22.7B (2023), peaking at $23.6B in 2022
* Data Center Revenue: Strong growth from $1.7B (2020) to $6.5B (2023), representing the fastest-growing segment
* Client Revenue: Declined from peak of $6.9B (2021) to $4.7B (2023), reflecting market saturation
* Gaming Revenue: Stabilized around $6.2B (2023) after reaching $6.8B in 2022
* Current Outlook: Q1 revenue projection of only $7.1B (compared to NVIDIA's $43B forecast)
* China Exposure: \~25% of revenue generated from China/Hong Kong, now threatened by export restrictions

Competitive assessment:

* NVIDIA Dominance: Continues to maintain leadership in AI accelerators with superior margins
* Emerging Competition: Major tech clients (Microsoft, Google, Meta) developing custom in-house chips
* Market Saturation: Growing signs of semiconductor overcapacity issues industry-wide
* Trade Restrictions: New export controls prevent selling MI308/MI309 chips to China without licenses ($800M revenue impact)

Recovery potential:

* Product Pipeline: MI350 series (H2 2025) and MI400 series (2026) could potentially boost performance
* Tariff Exemptions: Semiconductor industry largely exempt from recent trade actions
* Current Valuation: DCF analysis suggests fair value of $135.16 per share (well above current price)
* Wall Street Consensus: Average price targets align with fundamental undervaluation assessment

Investment considerations:

* Short-Term Outlook: Limited catalysts for immediate appreciation despite undervaluation
* Competitive Position: Ongoing struggle to establish meaningful market share against NVIDIA
* Macro Factors: Trade tensions and possible recession create additional downside risks
* Revenue Growth: Data center momentum potentially offset by client segment weakness

Despite AMD being fundamentally undervalued by DCF metrics, I remain cautious about short-term prospects. The Value Sense data shows impressive historical growth but recent segment performance suggests challenges ahead. While recovery is possible with successful MI350/MI400 launches and improved macro conditions, current competitive positioning and market sentiment suggest limited upside in the near term.",2025-04-23,0,9

1j9j16t_INTC,INTC,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

1iley0m_META,META,How does AMD project no real growth in the datacenter segment with all these investments?,Many posts have been made on the massive investments the mag7 and others are announcing in AI infrastructure. The total amount is literally in the hundreds of billions. NVIDIA has of course got a product (hardware + software) which according to most is better suited for most tasks but they cannot deliver everything for everyone all at once and have gotten quite big delays on the product as a result. Meta and Oracle already use AMD for their workloads and have also announced massive investmentprograms. Is AMD‚Äôs product so bad that they rather wait and pay more for NVIDIA eventhough they also use AMD? I have probably made many mistakes in my reasoning but I just don‚Äôt understand why AMD does not grow unless the product is utter shit. ,2025-02-09,80,43

1iiu7pz_IBM,IBM,Great Time to Scoop up Some AMD!,"I believe the market is overreacting to AMD Q4 earnings, representing a great time to add some shares. Let's get into it.

**Q4 Highlights -**

* Revenue of $7,658 billion, 24% increase YoY.
* Gross Profit of $3,882, 33% increase YoY.
* Increased Gross Margin of 51%.
* Operating Income of $871 million, 155% increase YoY.
* Data Center segment revenue of $3.9 billion, 69% increase YoY.

**Full Year Financial Highlights 2024 -**

* Revenue of $25,785 billion, 14% increase.
* Gross Profit of $12,725 billion, 22% increase.
* Net Income of $1,641, 92% increase.
* Data Center revenue of $12,6 billion, 94% increase.
* Client segment revenue of $7.1 billion, 52% increase.

**My Thoughts & Interpretation of Q4 -** Looking at these numbers, they all seem pretty great. AMD posted a record year in just about every category. They continue to secure deals like the ones made with IBM in November, and with Dell in January. They also continue to innovate with new product releases in order to stay competitive. Investors simply got spooked because of the revenue miss for data centers and lower than expected GPU sales. Is this enough cause for concern? I think not. I find it ridiculous that they experienced 69% growth YoY for Q4 data center revenue, and still got wrecked after earnings, with a 94% increase in the segment for the entire year! The way I see it, they are demonstrating their ability to capture market share. Not to mention they posted record revenue in the client segment. They gave strong guidance, expecting revenue for Q1 2025 of $7.1 billion, which would be 30% YoY growth. This is all bullish to me.

**Key Financial Metrics -** Gross profit as a percentage of sales has been trending upwards for years, now sitting at 53%. This signifies good management and increasing operational efficiency. They have a very low FWD PEG of .57 and FWD P/B ratio of 3.14 representing undervaluation. 

**Average 5-Year Growth Rates -** Revenue Growth = 33.91%. Net Income = 36.92%. EBITDA Growth = 65.27%. FCF Per Share = 68.86%. Working Capital = 44.21%.

**Conclusion -** I think this is a great company that is simply unloved by the market currently. They have done nothing but demonstrate their ability to innovate and compete over the years. This is a trend that I do not see slowing down. The most recent dip presents a great buy opportunity as the price will correct eventually. **At a price per share of $111, I think AMD trades at a bargain considering future growth and the overall potential of the company. $200+ is on the horizon.** \*Que Advanced Money Destroyer jokes\*

1ii0pm0_AMD,AMD,AMD Dumped. Pump NVDA?,"After seeing the earnings report of AMD and seeing that they miss out on revenue from data centers and barely scraped past expected earnings, could this be good news for NVDA. My logic is that after seeing AMD fall 8.84% (10.560$) post market, could this mean market sentiment could be in favor of NVDA. I think this because they are direct competitors, since AMD dumped, would this entice people to put money into NVDA due to the fact that their main competitor may not be able to keep up.
I hope this makes sense and my logic is somewhat on the right path. I‚Äôve only been trading for a little under 2 years with a lot to learn. If im wrong about anything, please let me know. I am on a journey to understand trading more and more each day.

1ihveoc_AMD,AMD,"AMD reports profit beat, but misses on data center revenue","Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.

Here‚Äôs how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected

Revenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion

AMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.

AMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company‚Äôs adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.

Su told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report ‚Äústrong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth‚Äù in 2025.

The company‚Äôs most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.

AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel‚Äôs processors.

However, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.

For the full year, AMD‚Äôs data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.

While AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it‚Äôs released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.

‚ÄúWe believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,‚Äù Su said on the earnings call with analysts.

AMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.

AMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company‚Äôs other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.

# Alphabet Slides After Cloud Sales Fall Short of Expectations

Alphabet just reminded investors that even tech giants can trip. The company‚Äôs fourth-quarter revenue landed at $96.5 billion‚Äîjust shy of expectations‚Äîbut the real disappointment came from Google Cloud. The division pulled in $12 billion, missing forecasts and raising concerns about whether AI-driven cloud growth is slowing down. Investors didn‚Äôt take it well. Shares tumbled over 9% in after-hours trading, wiping out much of this year‚Äôs gains.

**Big AI Bets, Bigger Bills**  
  
While cloud struggled, Alphabet is doubling down on AI. The company announced a jaw-dropping $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, blowing past Wall Street‚Äôs $58 billion estimate. That cash will fund data centers and infrastructure to power AI ambitions, giving a nice boost to chip supplier Broadcom, whose shares popped 6%. But with rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek proving they can build AI models for far less, Alphabet‚Äôs spending spree is raising eyebrows.

**Search Still Reigns, But Challenges Mount**  
  
Despite the cloud miss, Google‚Äôs core business held strong. Search advertising raked in $54 billion, edging past estimates, while YouTube brought in $10.5 billion‚Äîhelped by a surge in election-year podcast ads. Meanwhile, Waymo and other experimental projects in Alphabet‚Äôs ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù segment fell flat, reporting just $400 million in revenue, well below expectations. Investors are increasingly questioning whether these moonshot ventures are worth the money.

Beyond earnings, Alphabet is facing growing regulatory headaches. U.S. and Chinese regulators are circling, with lawsuits targeting its search dominance and ad practices. At the same time, AI challengers are nipping at Google‚Äôs heels, with OpenAI now embedding real-time search capabilities into ChatGPT. For now, Alphabet is stuck balancing massive AI investments, legal fights, and investor jitters. Whether all that spending translates into long-term dominance‚Äîor just thinner margins‚Äîremains the trillion-dollar question.

# Echelon Of Earnings From AMD, Chipotle, Snapchat

**AMD‚Äôs Data Center Miss Overshadows Strong Earnings**  
  
AMD delivered a solid earnings beat, but investors were fixated on a shortfall in its data center business. The chipmaker posted $7.66 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations, yet its crucial data center unit fell short, reporting $3.86 billion instead of the projected $4.14 billion. Despite a 69% year-over-year jump in data center sales‚Äîdriven by AI chip demand‚ÄîWall Street wanted more. Shares dropped 5% in extended trading. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, forecasting strong double-digit growth in 2025 as AMD scales its AI chip business, but for now, the market isn‚Äôt buying in.

**Chipotle‚Äôs Forecast Sours Otherwise Strong Earnings**  
  
Chipotle kept the burritos rolling with solid Q4 earnings, but its outlook left investors with indigestion. The company posted $2.85 billion in revenue, matching estimates, while earnings per share came in slightly ahead. Traffic remained strong, up 4% year over year, and the brand continued outpacing the broader restaurant industry. However, a lukewarm 2025 same-store sales forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth disappointed Wall Street, leading to a 3% drop in after-hours trading. Chipotle remains bullish on expansion, planning to open up to 345 new locations‚Äîmost featuring drive-thru ‚ÄúChipotlanes‚Äù‚Äîbut investors were hoping for a bigger growth story.

**Snap Pops on Earnings Beat, But Guidance Disappoints**  
  
Snap‚Äôs stock jumped after the social media company reported a rare earnings win, with revenue climbing 14% to $1.56 billion and daily active users hitting 453 million‚Äîboth ahead of expectations. The company even turned a profit, a major turnaround from last year‚Äôs loss. However, the celebration was short-lived as Snap‚Äôs Q1 guidance underwhelmed, with projected earnings below analyst expectations. The company cited increased investment spending, legal costs, and a seasonal marketing shift as key factors. While its Snapchat+ subscription service continues to gain traction, adding 2 million subscribers in Q4, Snap still faces regulatory scrutiny and heavy competition from Meta and TikTok.  


# Trump Signs Order to Create U.S. Sovereign-Wealth Fund

President Trump is making big moves again‚Äîthis time by signing an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The goal? Monetize America‚Äôs balance sheet, invest in national projects, and, according to Trump, maybe even play a role in securing a deal for TikTok.

At an Oval Office ceremony, Trump framed the fund as a game-changer for U.S. economic strategy, promising it would be ‚Äúone of the biggest.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed up the urgency, pledging to ‚Äústand this thing up within the next 12 months.‚Äù

**How Would It Work?**

Sovereign wealth funds aren‚Äôt new‚ÄîNorway, China, and Saudi Arabia have been running them for years, leveraging oil profits and trade surpluses to bankroll investments. The U.S., however, has a slight problem: no surplus.

The government‚Äôs balance sheet is heavy on real estate and student loans but light on liquid assets, making funding a massive investment vehicle tricky. Trump floated the idea of using tariff revenue to fund the venture‚Äîthough that assumes the recently delayed tariffs actually go into effect and generate enough cash.

**A New Player in Global Markets?**

If it gets off the ground, the fund would join a crowded field of government-backed investors influencing everything from infrastructure to AI. Trump‚Äôs team has hinted that it could be used to invest in manufacturing, defense, and critical supply chains, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggesting the U.S. should get equity stakes in companies it does business with‚Äîthink vaccine makers and defense contractors.

**TikTok‚Äôs Wild Card Role**

Trump also hinted that the fund could somehow facilitate TikTok‚Äôs U.S. future, though the details remain murky. The president has been pushing for an American-owned TikTok spin-off and previously suggested the government itself should take a 50% stake. Whether the fund plays a role in that deal‚Äîor if it‚Äôs just Trump thinking out loud‚Äîremains to be seen.

# Alphabet Slides After Cloud Sales Fall Short of Expectations

Alphabet just reminded investors that even tech giants can trip. The company‚Äôs fourth-quarter revenue landed at $96.5 billion‚Äîjust shy of expectations‚Äîbut the real disappointment came from Google Cloud. The division pulled in $12 billion, missing forecasts and raising concerns about whether AI-driven cloud growth is slowing down. Investors didn‚Äôt take it well. Shares tumbled over 9% in after-hours trading, wiping out much of this year‚Äôs gains.

**Big AI Bets, Bigger Bills**  
  
While cloud struggled, Alphabet is doubling down on AI. The company announced a jaw-dropping $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, blowing past Wall Street‚Äôs $58 billion estimate. That cash will fund data centers and infrastructure to power AI ambitions, giving a nice boost to chip supplier Broadcom, whose shares popped 6%. But with rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek proving they can build AI models for far less, Alphabet‚Äôs spending spree is raising eyebrows.

**Search Still Reigns, But Challenges Mount**  
  
Despite the cloud miss, Google‚Äôs core business held strong. Search advertising raked in $54 billion, edging past estimates, while YouTube brought in $10.5 billion‚Äîhelped by a surge in election-year podcast ads. Meanwhile, Waymo and other experimental projects in Alphabet‚Äôs ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù segment fell flat, reporting just $400 million in revenue, well below expectations. Investors are increasingly questioning whether these moonshot ventures are worth the money.

Beyond earnings, Alphabet is facing growing regulatory headaches. U.S. and Chinese regulators are circling, with lawsuits targeting its search dominance and ad practices. At the same time, AI challengers are nipping at Google‚Äôs heels, with OpenAI now embedding real-time search capabilities into ChatGPT. For now, Alphabet is stuck balancing massive AI investments, legal fights, and investor jitters. Whether all that spending translates into long-term dominance‚Äîor just thinner margins‚Äîremains the trillion-dollar question.

# Market Movements

* üìâ¬†**Tariff Uncertainty Puts the Fed in a Bind**: The Federal Reserve faces a dilemma as Trump's tariffs threaten to both raise inflation and slow GDP growth. Economists project tariffs could shave 1.2% off growth while adding 0.7% to core inflation, potentially forcing the Fed to delay rate cuts or pivot later in the year ($SPX).
* üìâ¬†**U.S. Job Openings Drop Sharply in December**: Job openings fell to 7.6 million, the lowest level since September and below expectations of 8 million.

# Echelon Of Earnings From AMD, Chipotle, Snapchat

**AMD‚Äôs Data Center Miss Overshadows Strong Earnings**  
  
AMD delivered a solid earnings beat, but investors were fixated on a shortfall in its data center business. The chipmaker posted $7.66 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations, yet its crucial data center unit fell short, reporting $3.86 billion instead of the projected $4.14 billion. Despite a 69% year-over-year jump in data center sales‚Äîdriven by AI chip demand‚ÄîWall Street wanted more. Shares dropped 5% in extended trading. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, forecasting strong double-digit growth in 2025 as AMD scales its AI chip business, but for now, the market isn‚Äôt buying in.

**Chipotle‚Äôs Forecast Sours Otherwise Strong Earnings**  
  
Chipotle kept the burritos rolling with solid Q4 earnings, but its outlook left investors with indigestion. The company posted $2.85 billion in revenue, matching estimates, while earnings per share came in slightly ahead. Traffic remained strong, up 4% year over year, and the brand continued outpacing the broader restaurant industry. However, a lukewarm 2025 same-store sales forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth disappointed Wall Street, leading to a 3% drop in after-hours trading. Chipotle remains bullish on expansion, planning to open up to 345 new locations‚Äîmost featuring drive-thru ‚ÄúChipotlanes‚Äù‚Äîbut investors were hoping for a bigger growth story.

**Snap Pops on Earnings Beat, But Guidance Disappoints**  
  
Snap‚Äôs stock jumped after the social media company reported a rare earnings win, with revenue climbing 14% to $1.56 billion and daily active users hitting 453 million‚Äîboth ahead of expectations. The company even turned a profit, a major turnaround from last year‚Äôs loss. However, the celebration was short-lived as Snap‚Äôs Q1 guidance underwhelmed, with projected earnings below analyst expectations. The company cited increased investment spending, legal costs, and a seasonal marketing shift as key factors. While its Snapchat+ subscription service continues to gain traction, adding 2 million subscribers in Q4, Snap still faces regulatory scrutiny and heavy competition from Meta and TikTok.  


# Trump Signs Order to Create U.S. Sovereign-Wealth Fund

President Trump is making big moves again‚Äîthis time by signing an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The goal? Monetize America‚Äôs balance sheet, invest in national projects, and, according to Trump, maybe even play a role in securing a deal for TikTok.

At an Oval Office ceremony, Trump framed the fund as a game-changer for U.S. economic strategy, promising it would be ‚Äúone of the biggest.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed up the urgency, pledging to ‚Äústand this thing up within the next 12 months.‚Äù

**How Would It Work?**

Sovereign wealth funds aren‚Äôt new‚ÄîNorway, China, and Saudi Arabia have been running them for years, leveraging oil profits and trade surpluses to bankroll investments. The U.S., however, has a slight problem: no surplus.

The government‚Äôs balance sheet is heavy on real estate and student loans but light on liquid assets, making funding a massive investment vehicle tricky. Trump floated the idea of using tariff revenue to fund the venture‚Äîthough that assumes the recently delayed tariffs actually go into effect and generate enough cash.

**A New Player in Global Markets?**

If it gets off the ground, the fund would join a crowded field of government-backed investors influencing everything from infrastructure to AI. Trump‚Äôs team has hinted that it could be used to invest in manufacturing, defense, and critical supply chains, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggesting the U.S. should get equity stakes in companies it does business with‚Äîthink vaccine makers and defense contractors.

**TikTok‚Äôs Wild Card Role**

The president has been pushing for an American-owned TikTok spin-off and previously suggested the government itself should take a 50% stake. Whether the fund plays a role in that deal‚Äîor if it‚Äôs just Trump thinking out loud‚Äîremains to be seen.

The executive order gives officials 90 days to draft a plan detailing investment strategies, governance, and legal considerations. But without a clear funding source, it‚Äôs unclear how this fund would compete with the trillion-dollar giants already dominating the space.

For 2024, the best overall and gaming CPU is likely the AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D (better value than Intel's Core Ultra 9 285k).

1ihveoc_META,META,"AMD reports profit beat, but misses on data center revenue","Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.

Here‚Äôs how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected

Revenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion

AMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.

AMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company‚Äôs adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.

Su told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report ‚Äústrong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth‚Äù in 2025.

The company‚Äôs most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.

AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel‚Äôs processors.

However, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.

For the full year, AMD‚Äôs data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.

While AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it‚Äôs released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.

‚ÄúWe believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,‚Äù Su said on the earnings call with analysts.

AMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.

AMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company‚Äôs other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.

1igo9wm_AMD,AMD,AMD - Short term pain (PUTS),"Short-term pain:

The market doesn't know how to grapple with efficiency gains associated with the DeepSeek-R1 release.

Will efficiency gains lead to a lowering of demand for AMD AI hardware?

* Long-term (unlikely): Commoditization of large language models will likely lead to quicker adoption of AI and increased capital expenditures. Efficiency gains will be superseded by high adoption rates.
* Short-term (uncertain): Positive indications from Microsoft and Facebook during earnings indicate that capital expenditures will not slow down relative to the DeepSeek-R1 release.
* AMD guidance is historically tepid. If this trend continues, expect short-term sell-offs as investors continue to assess the effect of DeepSeek on the broader AI market. Even with positive indications from large hyperscalers.

¬†

Future tariffs will apply¬†greater pressure on AMD's consumer portfolio

As it stands, AMD will not be immune from the effects of future tariffs.

* Increased prices on laptop and desktop processors
* Increased prices on gaming GPUs and SoCs (Poor holiday console sales, we will likely see a year/year decrease in revenue)
* Effects on data center revenue although not as pronounced (less price-sensitive buyer)

¬†

Conclusion - There is too much uncertainty around AMD to be bullish going into earnings. Data center segment growth will likely exceed expectations, but without strong guidance DeepSeek-R1 release and the prospect of less AI hardware demand will likely overshadow beats in data center growth. Future tariffs will also put downward pressure on both the top and bottom line for forward-looking guidance. I will be looking to buy puts today going into earnings (if reasonable). The current put call ratio is 0.82, which I expect will increase over the coming days.",2025-02-03,0,2

1i1ctd5_INTC,INTC,AMD vs. Nvidia: The battle for AI dominance heats up?,"After experiencing a remarkable surge, with its stock price jumping over 100% from $93 to $226 between October 2023 and March 2024, the excitement surrounding its AI accelerator revenue seemed justified. However, reality hit hard when the average selling price (ASP) and margins for the MI300 accelerators turned out to be much lower than expected. This miscalculation led to a significant correction in the stock price, which now sits at $115, which is far below its peak.

Currently, analysts suggest a relative value of $138, while a DCF analysis points to $97.9. With a market cap of $188.31 billion and 1.6 billion shares outstanding, there's a lot to unpack. Institutional ownership is quite strong at 71.34%, which is encouraging, but it's worth noting that short interest is below 5%.

The fourth-quarter guidance wasn‚Äôt exactly a confidence booster for 2025. Many analysts are using linear growth models for AI revenue, which can be misleading. The CPU market isn‚Äôt expected to grow significantly, but AMD has a projected TAM of $500 billion for AI accelerators by 2028. Even if AMD captures just 10% of that, we're looking at over $75 billion in annual revenue by then‚Äîmore than triple the projected 2024 earnings.

When we look at profitability, there‚Äôs a mixed bag. AMD boasts a solid gross margin of 52.12%, exceeding the 40% target, and strong management metrics (all above 10%). However, the net margin is only 7.52%, which is below the desired 10%. The Piotroski F-Score of 6 raises some flags, showing weaknesses like a declining return on assets and gross margin, while the P/E ratio of 101.9x is much higher than the peer median of 37.8x. On a brighter note, AMD has consistently beaten revenue and EPS expectations over the past several years.

Broader economic factors are also weighing on AMD. There‚Äôs been a shift away from large tech stocks to sectors like banking and Bitcoin, and concerns about slower AI infrastructure spending and geopolitical risks are contributing to the stock's struggles. Plus, there's always the looming threat of a significant correction in Nvidia's stock, which could further impact AMD.

Despite these challenges, AMD's recent underperformance has created an intriguing opportunity for investors. The gap between its current valuation and future potential is widening. Insights from CEO Dr. Lisa Su highlight AMD's focus on building customer trust in its new technology and catching up to Nvidia. For instance, the MI325X is only two quarters behind Nvidia's H200, and the launch timing of the MI355X will be crucial.

AMD has several key initiatives in the pipeline that could unlock its potential:

\- Ultra Ethernet and Pensando DPU: Expanding the AI training market in late 2025.

\- ZT Systems: Giving AMD access to major data center projects with hyperscalers.

\- Mature ROCM Libraries: Improving competitiveness, especially regarding total cost of ownership.

\- Support for FP4/FP6/Int8 with MI355X: Removing competitive barriers.

These advancements are largely independent of Nvidia‚Äôs moves, which is a positive sign for AMD.

Looking ahead, the upcoming fourth-quarter report in January 2025 could provide a much-needed boost, especially given the low expectations. However, a larger catalyst related to the MI355X might be necessary to surpass the highs from March 2024. If AMD starts showing strong growth while Nvidia slows down, we could see a shift in the narrative, with more investors turning their attention to AMD.

Of course, there are near-term risks, including potential supply constraints for HBM. But AMD's strategy to diversify its suppliers should help mitigate this. Despite these hurdles, the long-term outlook for AMD remains bright thanks to its innovative technology and expanding market opportunities. Although, insider ownership is low at 0.95%, which is something to watch.",2025-01-14,28,43
1i1fe4x_INTC,INTC,The role of ROCm in AMD's future,"I've recently bought some AMD shares because the share price does not seem to reflect the progress they are making on the hardware front.

I'm considering buying more shares but I find it hard to pull the trigger because the adoption of ROCm seems to be lacking.

I've tried to get a sense of ROCm vs. CUDA usage in as many ways as I could find:

\- Google search trends  
\- Github statistics of the official ROCm repository  
\- Github statistics of the TensorFlow and PyTorch library  
\- Package manager statistics of ROCm related packages (including TensorFlow and PyTorch)  
\- Dockerhub statistics of ROCm related images

I understand that these statistics are not going to reflect the reality but they do give an (albeit indirect) sense of the difference in adoption.

It seems that CUDA easily has 10X more usage and activity than ROCm and I currently don't see how AMD is going to be able to turn that around.

If AMD AI related hardware stays on par with Nvidia's counterparts or only slightly outperforms them, there is nearly no incentive for companies to make the switch to ROCm unless they use unforked TensorFlow or PyTorch solutions.

Large companies usually operate on forked versions of these frameworks to suit their own particular needs and are also highly likely to have several projects directly integrating with CUDA which makes the switch to ROCm very costly.

How large a role do you guys think the adoption of ROCm will play in the future of AMD and how do you see AMD incentivizing large companies to make the switch from CUDA?",2025-01-14,31,20

**Data Center Growth**¬†\- This is AMD‚Äôs fastest growing segment and accounts for roughly 50% of all revenue. This number is going to continue its rapid rise due to key acquisitions and product innovation. Lisa Su estimates the market for data center AI accelerators to grow at a CAGR of 60% until the year 2028. That would value the market at $500 billion for things like CPUs, GPU‚Äôs, FPGA‚Äôs, and ASIC‚Äôs. Obviously, Nvidia currently dominates the market. Despite this, there is room for multiple players and AMD has shown their ability to capture market share. In 2022, they surpassed Intel in both market value and annual revenue, positioning themselves as the clear number two player in the market. I've said it before with companies like Palantir, data is the future and every company needs it. Well in order for a company to have data, you need chips. Everything needs chips. We are still in a small and juvenile market that has massive amounts of room to grow.

**Acquisition of ZT Systems** \- Announced in August 2024, AMD will acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025. ZT specializes in designing and deploying data center AI computing and storage solutions. This shows the focus and commitment AMD has to their fastest growing segment.¬†

**Strong Belief in Lisa Su -** Lisa Su is an amazing CEO with a strong desire for excellency. After becoming CEO in 2014, she has completely turned around the company and continues to improve it.¬†Here is a great video to watch of her - [https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8](https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8)

**Conclusion** \- AMD is gaining significant amounts of market share for data centers, a trend that will continue as the market grows. Despite declines in the gaming and embedded segments, the company overall continues to grow revenues. The decline in gaming looks alarming but it makes sense. New gen consoles came out 4 years ago which AMD supplies chips for. Regardless, what I‚Äôm focused on here is the data center growth. AMD is innovative and managed extremely well which can be seen by continuously improving operating margins and FCF. This company will continue to become a monster.¬†At a current price of **$125,** I expect this to easily get back to **$200+** in 2025 giving a solid 60% upside.",2025-01-05,590,422

AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) stellar management team will be in the spotlight as Intel (INTC) looks for its next CEO. It's important to have stable management and a clear direction for the company. Over the past few years, Intel has changed CEOs frequently, leading to shifting priorities and ultimately hurting the company's growth potential. On the other hand, AMD's shares have risen 50 times since ZF Su took over as CEO in 2014. Over the past few quarters, AMD has rapidly expanded its AI division and is on track for strong results in 2025.



AMD is down 15 percent year-to-date, compared to a 25 percent return for the S&P 500. AMD forecasts $5 billion in AI revenue by 2024. Most analysts expect AI revenue in 2025 to be close to $10 billion. However, this number seems to be underestimated as AMD prepares to launch the next generation of its powerful MI325 and MI350 family of chips. Demand for AMD's chips is very strong, and we're likely to hear from more major customers in the near term. AMD could realize nearly $14-15 billion in AI revenue by 2025, despite limited supply.



AMD stock is trading at less than 17 times fiscal year ending December 2026 earnings per share estimates. Despite strong growth momentum and an expectation that EPS will more than double over the next two years, AMD stock is underperforming in 2024, but if the company is able to beat its AI revenue forecasts, we could see huge bullish momentum in the coming quarters.



AMD stock has pulled back nearly 30% after its recent earnings call, which was a significant pullback despite the company's good earnings results. This is a significant pullback despite the company's decent earnings results. one of the reasons for the drop in AMD's stock price is that Wall Street expects AMD's AI chip sales to be modest by 2025. Most recently, Bank of America downgraded AMD because it predicted AMD would lose market share to hyperscale manufacturers that prefer to use their own custom chips in data centers. Hyperscale manufacturers contribute nearly 50 percent of NVIDIA's data center revenue and are the main reason for NVIDIA's huge revenue and earnings per share growth. Almost all hyperscale manufacturers are developing their own custom chips for cloud business or other core computing needs. However, AMD still offers good value to these hyperscale manufacturers due to significantly lower chip prices compared to NVIDIA and greater flexibility compared to NVIDIA's CUDA platform. AMD also has a small market share in the AI chip industry compared to NVIDIA. Even if some hyperscalers choose their chips, this provides the company with good room for growth.



What could change Wall Street's view of AMD? Analysts believe the next earnings call will be important, as it will give management a chance to lay out plans for AI growth in the coming quarters, and AMD will likely be able to beat Wall Street's expectations for AI revenue. If AMD is able to achieve $15 billion or more in AI revenues by 2025, this would lead to a rapid shift in market sentiment and we could see a significant rally in the stock.



AMD has been managed very well under ZF Su's leadership. Normally, analysts don't mention this factor, but it's becoming increasingly important as Intel searches for another CEO after nearly four years of Pat Kissinger's tenure. AMD shares have risen 50-fold since Su Zifeng joined the company in 2014. We don't often see dramatic changes like this in the corporate world.



Analysts think Intel's foundry strategy was a mistake. The foundry business requires tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures, and it takes a long time to achieve good results. Intel doesn't have that kind of time. There's also the issue of opportunity cost. Intel was busy expanding its foundry business and missed out on the AI opportunity.



AMD's management is much more flexible and quickly moved to the AI business once it showed great potential. It's worth noting that AMD has been able to exceed their own projections when it comes to AI revenues. at the end of 2023, AMD announced that they expect AI revenues to reach $2 billion by 2024. This number has been increasing throughout the year, and during the most recent earnings season, management announced that AMD would realize $5 billion in AI revenue by 2024. In just 12 months, we've seen AMD's AI forecasts grow 2.5x. This demonstrates the company's ability to rapidly increase chip supply and gain a good customer base.

  
Much of AMD's future growth will come from its AI business, so it's important to properly assess the potential of that business. An earlier Market Watch report noted that Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland estimated that AMD's AI revenue could reach $9 billion by 2025, with $11-12 billion ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù. Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer said $10 billion would be a ‚Äúdifficult number to achieve,‚Äù and Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar estimated AMD's AI revenues would reach $10.2 billion by 2025. Most estimates are closer to $10 billion, and if AMD can achieve higher AI revenues in 2025, that would be a big boost to sentiment.



Two important factors in AMD's favor are flexibility and value. AMD offers more flexibility to hyperscalers who don't want to be tied to Nvidia's CUDA platform, which is considered a strong moat for the company, but which could also end up limiting customer choice. Another important factor is value; Nvidia's H100 costs four times as much as rival AMD chips. With hyperscalers ordering thousands of these chips, getting better value out of them is important to maintain your margins and gain a competitive edge.



AMD will increase sales of its MI325 and MI350 series in 2025. This will provide a strong boost to the company's AI revenue. If AMD's AI revenues approach $14 billion to $15 billion in 2025, we could see the stock provide very strong bullish momentum. The company has consistently outperformed both market expectations and its own forecasts for AI revenue, and AMD could outperform the market's general expectations in the AI space in 2025.



Rapid sales of AI chips will inevitably help boost AMD's margins and earnings per share in the coming quarters. The market generally expects AMD's earnings per share to grow 55 percent next year and another 38 percent in 2026. This would increase earnings per share for the fiscal year ending December 2026 to $7.05 per share. At that EPS, the expected price-to-earnings ratio is less than 17 times, which is very modest for one of the major AI players in the industry.

AMD's revenues and operating income have turned an inflection point as the data center division has increased its share of revenues. Overall revenue grew from $5.8 billion a year ago to $6.8 billion in the most recent quarter, despite the poor performance of the Gaming and Embedded divisions. This is thanks to the Data Center division, which more than doubled its revenue to $3.5 billion in the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.

Operating income was more heavily impacted by recent earnings, indicating a lucrative data center business.



AMD's AI division is facing a number of positives and is expected to beat market expectations in 2025. This could improve operating income and EPS trends in the coming quarters, making AMD stock a good choice at current prices.



AMD's strong and stable management has delivered better results over the past few years compared to Intel. Unlike Intel, which is trying to expand its expensive foundry business, AMD has also made better strategic decisions by focusing on its artificial intelligence business. Most analysts estimate that AMD's AI revenue in 2025 will be close to $10 billion. That number may be underestimated as the company accelerates development of its next-generation AI chips.



AMD offers flexibility and value to hyperscale organizations, which increases the appeal of its AI chips. Its price-to-earnings ratio is less than 17 times for the fiscal year ending December 2026, which is quite modest for a company that is growing earnings per share rapidly and is a core part of the AI industry.

1hkb3x4_AMD,AMD,Nvidia will moon - In Depth Benchmarking tests of AMD MX300 vs Nvidia H100 and H200 by SemiAnalysis,"tl:dr - the world is as expected. AMD's software needs lots of hand holding and support, Nvidia's runs very well right out of the box. Nvidia maintains performance advantage in nearly every test run. [https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/](https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/)

  
Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia‚Äôs Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn‚Äôt run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn‚Äôt need much support.

\- AMD‚Äôs Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren‚Äôt supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD‚Äôs results would have been much lower than Nvidia‚Äôs.

\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting

\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidia‚Äôs real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.

\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software.

\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X ‚Äòs matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidia‚Äôs H100 and H200.

\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMD‚Äôs internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.

\- AMD‚Äôs training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMD‚Äôs lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidia‚Äôs strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.

\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.

\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.",2024-12-22,172,91

1hh5e9r_NVDA,NVDA,Why I'm bullish on AMD,"I don't think it makes sense for AMD to be down so much this year, even though the tech sector is doing well

I think AMD shares fell 5% last week despite being the leader in CPU (now that Intel is in trouble) and to a lesser extent GPU makers

I'm bullish on AMD for the following reasons

\-Replacement GPU are available on a budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand in the next few years

\-It's the best CPU for consumers and data centers, no doubt about it. and you need CPU to reason about AI models trained on GPU

\-The PC market will enter a 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with the end of Windows 10 support

\-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors

Before anyone says NVDA is 1000x better than AMD ......

I agree that AMD is not dominant in CUDA and that they are years behind NVDA in this area and may not even be close to catching up

I don't think AMD is ‚Äúdead‚Äù in the consumer GPU space

I agree that most developers consider NVDA when developing games, but it's definitely a cheaper alternative to NVDA, especially in less affluent countries

I have reservations about what I'm going to say next - I think AMD is going to overshadow what's left of NVDA

Given AMD recent acquisitions, I also expect AMD to launch its own parallel computing platform.

I realize this is also an unlikely goal, but if demand surges, AMD may be considered for CUDA

I am fully invested in AMD because I think AMD is trading below its fair price

That said, I think AMD is currently worth about 150-160 fair value

1hf8wr8_AMD,AMD,$AMD Bottoms Within the Next $10,"Intro:  
Many of you are probably pretty tired of $AMD. The last 8 or so months of downtrend is pretty deterring, especially while $NVDA continues to tear upwards. You're also probably tired of seeing hopium posts in the midst of tons of bear posts. I think most agree that fundamentally $AMD is a great company that should not be negative YTD. For those of you that have been waiting a long time to see it catch a bid off of the AI hype and necessity for chips, I think the wait is coming to an end. It's easy to point at the institutions and hedge funds and blame them for nuking the price, but hopefully with this thesis I can show that $AMD structurally is ready to reverse. To the untrained eye, the chart displayed should be easy to read, you can see the similarities between the two corrections quite easily. If any of you see any holes in this thesis please let me know. ""but institutional buying/selling,  unusual options, market dominance,"" Yea IDGAF about all that, just let me know if there are holes in the technical analysis.  If you don't want to read, I'll sum it up briefly:  AMD will bottom at $114-$121, followed by an HTF extension to $330.

Length of Corrections, Fibonacci Levels, Timing of Earnings & Structure:  
The first correction pictured lasted \~315 days, bottoming \~21 days from prior to earnings. The current correction is pacing to also finish within the golden pocket ($114-$122, where institutions have most interest in buying), matching the length of the previous correction and also \~21 days off of the next earnings. Earnings are marked in blue vertical lines on the chart. As you can see with our current correction, we are likely in the final wave of our ABCDE correction. There is a small chance we could skip the golden pocket and shoot for the 0.236 @ $96, but this is quite unlikely. The run up that followed the previous correction saw price top at $227, nearly touching our 1.618 extension at $232. If we see the same process unfold: A bounce and run up from the pocket, we could expect our 1.618 to be @ $333 per share, pictured in the top right.

MACD & RSI:  
Once again, If you just study the structure of the MACD underneath the two corrections, it is easy to see how close they are in form. I'm not going to attempt to explain each cross and describe what I am seeing in words, the charts speak for themselves for MACD. RSI during the previous correction saw a low highlighted in green at the bottom at 32. The previous two run ups both peaked at 82, and I would like to think it is highly likely RSI will bottom at 32 again, currently sitting at 39. This one it is also easy to see the similarities in structure on the chart. MACD and RSI showing the same structure as the last correction before a 300% run with a bottom going into earnings is possibly the most bullish copy and paste set up I have seen in a long time.

Conclusion:  
I don't wish to spread more lackluster hopium for this stock. I am trying to make the point that structurally, if it were to bottom and reverse, within the next month would be the most logical place for this to occur. Hopefully, those that have been burned holding this stock understand that it simply just needed time to cool off after that 300% run. Once markets find the price has been pushed low enough it should begin another, it's literally illustrated in the charts. I could be wrong. There could be more downside after the golden pocket, but this is a play I am willing to lose money on because it meets every checkmark presented from an analysis view. If it folds I cannot be upset because I stuck with the rules and didn't put money somewhere else that didn't look as structurally sound.

> AMD's datacenter segment revenue reached $3.549 billion in the third quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter and AI group's earnings were $3.3 billion in Q3 2024. Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins.
> 
> It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales.

1ghyq7o_NVDA,NVDA,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?

While everyone is drooling over NVDA, AMD has been quietly positioning itself for a massive AI breakout.

1. **MI300: The NVDA Killer**
AMD's MI300 chip is set to disrupt the AI GPU market. It's not just hype - Microsoft and Meta are already on board. This beast could capture 20-30% of the AI data center market, eating into NVDA's lunch.

2. **Xilinx Acquisition: The Secret Weapon**
Everyone's sleeping on the Xilinx deal. This isn't just another boring acquisition - it's AMD's ticket to dominating adaptive computing and edge AI.

3. **AI PCs: The Next Big Thing**
Forget about data centers for a sec. AMD's pushing hard into AI-compatible CPUs for PCs. This could be a massive, untapped market that NVDA can't touch.

4. **Lisa Su: The 4D Chess Master**
AMD's CEO isn't just smart - she's related to Jensen Huang (NVDA's CEO). It's like a tech soap opera, and Lisa's playing the long game.

5. **Potential Earnings Explosion**
Analysts are projecting AMD's earnings could hit $10 per share by 2026. Do the math - that could push the stock to $300+.

The recent dip? That's your golden ticket, regards. While the market's freaking out over some China drama, AMD's busy laying the groundwork for AI domination.

# Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of ‚Äúso close, yet so far,‚Äù Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company‚Äôs disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft‚Äôs revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure‚Äôs performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue‚Äîjust shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub‚Äôs impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn‚Äôt enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft‚Äôs other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure‚Äôs growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn‚Äôt enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft‚Äôs shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market‚Äôs laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

**Chips Ahoy! AMD‚Äôs Data Center Sales Surge 115%**

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let‚Äôs break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company‚Äôs overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD‚Äôs business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

**On The Horizon**

Tomorrow‚Äôs labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week‚Äôs job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

**Before Market Open**

**Boeing ($BA)**: Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm‚Äôs valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",2024-07-30,1,0

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm‚Äôs valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",2024-07-30,1,0

1dnvexe_AMD,AMD,"Swing Trading Strategy: SIJ, DEC, and AMD ","I've put together a swing trading strategy for ProShares UltraShort Industrials (SIJ), Diversified Energy Company PLC (DEC), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). My focus is on short-term bullish trends that I‚Äôve identified through technical analysis and the 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA).

For SIJ, the price consistently rises above the 50-day SMA, confirmed by a double bottom pattern. This pattern suggests a potential reversal, which gives me confidence in the stock's upward momentum. I plan to buy around $9.87, targeting $10.98, with a stop loss at $9.67 to manage risk. The consistent performance above the 50-day SMA supports this decision, indicating a strong bullish trend.

DEC also shows a bullish trend with its price above the 50-day SMA, confirmed by a double bottom pattern. Currently priced at $13.60, DEC's upward trajectory aligns with my strategy of targeting stocks that exhibit strong reversal signals. I plan to buy now at this price, aiming for a 10-15% increase. Setting a stop loss below the recent low ensures I manage risk effectively, protecting my investment against potential downturns.

For AMD, the price remains consistently above the 50-day SMA, indicating a robust bullish trend. The stock is currently consolidating just below $169. By purchasing close to $167.94, I anticipate a breakout and subsequent price increase. I plan to target a 5-10% gain, setting a stop loss slightly below $169 to safeguard my investment. The strong performance above the 50-day SMA and the potential for a breakout provide a compelling case for immediate entry.

Overall, the graphs for SIJ, DEC, and AMD, with prices consistently above their 50-day SMAs, support my swing trading strategy. This setup allows me to enter positions immediately and target short-term gains while managing risk. By staying updated on market conditions and monitoring volume, I can validate trends and make informed trading decisions to optimize returns. This comprehensive analysis and strategic approach ensure that I am well-positioned to capitalize on bullish trends and maximize my trading success.",2024-06-25,2,1

1dca52c_AMD,AMD,Riding the AMD Wave,"Let me give you the lowdown on what‚Äôs going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.

# Current Play:

So, AMD's been moving‚Äîup 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here‚Äôs the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That‚Äôs a 78% drop in volume! Something‚Äôs brewing.

# Analyst Chatter:

The street‚Äôs buzzing. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù
* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating.
* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with ‚Äúoverweight.‚Äù
* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù with a $190 target.
* **Wedbush:** Stays ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù with a $200 target.

Overall, it‚Äôs a solid ‚ÄúModerate Buy‚Äù from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They‚Äôre mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.

# Financial Pulse:

Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue‚Äôs at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.

Key ratios to watch:

* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.
* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.
* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it‚Äôs got a beta of 1.69, so it‚Äôs got some juice in a volatile market.

# Insider Moves:

Now, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.

# Institutional Maneuvers:

Big players are piling in:

* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.
* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.
* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.
* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.

# My Strategy:

**Technical Setup:**

* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.
* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.

**Entry Points:**

* **Short-Term:** I‚Äôm eyeing a dip around $165. That‚Äôs close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.
* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it‚Äôs time to load up.

**Exit Strategy:**

* **Short-Term Gains:** I‚Äôm looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley‚Äôs targets. Quick win.
* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush‚Äôs target lies. That‚Äôs a juicy exit if it runs up there.

# Market Conditions:

Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.

# The Bottom Line:

AMD‚Äôs got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It‚Äôs a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let‚Äôs see how this ride goes!

Once known mostly for building PC add-on graphics cards for gamers, Nvidia has transformed its graphics processing units, or GPUs, into the beating heart of the AI revolution, powering the creation of large language models and running the inference software that leverages them in data centers around the world. Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.  
  
But fresh competition is coming‚Äîfrom companies big and small‚Äîand the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That‚Äôs almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.

. . . . . . 

A few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make‚Äîor, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.  
  
Huang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren‚Äôt the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well‚Äîor better‚Äîthan Nvidia.

. . . . . 

Nvidia‚Äôs rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won‚Äôt be winner-take-all. It isn‚Äôt game over. It‚Äôs game on.

this report pulls price action data on AMD for the past year by weekday to see how often gaps tend to fill when price opens below yesterday's close or when price opens above yesterday's close.

for context:

\- a gap fill: when price touches yesterday's closing price  
\- a gap down: when price opens below yesterday's closing price  
\- a gap up: when price opens above yesterday's closing price

let's zoom in on Monday for the sake of this example. what I found was that in the past year, when Monday's price opened above Friday's closing price, price on Monday tended to touch Friday's closing price 79% of the time, whereas when price on Monday opened below Friday's closing price, price on Monday tended to touch Friday's closing price 90% of the time.

if you're trading AMD on Monday, remember what's happened historically and set targets around Friday's closing price seeing as there's a high chance it will retouch in either scenario.",2024-04-19,0,3

what I found was that Thursday's see an absolute spike in volume and range compared to the rest of the week. if you're looking to avoid choppy price action, look for days where volume and range are the highest. it's always easier to catch a small piece of a bigger move than it is to catch a big piece of a smaller move.

And this thursday after several ups and downs I decided that I would sell it at the higher usual price. Little did I know, AMD experienced a surge in the price, going form 186 to nearly 200, which I will admit is not that huge, but still it is not insignificant. And my question is - why did AMD suddenly go up that much after being at around 175 for some time? I cannot find anyhting unusual going on at AMD so this came out of nowhere for me.

If NVIDIA can‚Äôt continue to get those chips fast enough guess who all the big AI companies are turning to for their chips. Nvidia is the big shark in the ocean, but AMD‚Äôs market share is increasing rapidly by the billions. So at even 5% of the market share of what AMD is projected to earn with AI that‚Äôs a big reason to wake this sleeping giant. I‚Äôve been in this stock long and I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if we see it skyrocketing over $250 per share next earnings. Nvidia has CUDA which is what most programmers want, but AMD chips can also work on CUDA unfortunately they cut the project short. I can also see INTEL producing chips designed by AMD and manufacturing them as well. Who else is in on this and sees the potential? I‚Äôve already doubled my money on NVIDIA.

1afxwfr_AMD,AMD,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",2024-02-01,219,155

I feel with Intel they have a lot of potential because they are starting to compete a little bit better with their new meteorlake chips, and by getting into the AI space. Intel is also a lot more cheaper and I can get a decent price for a further contract. This would give me some more time to hope for them to come up with something good.

if certain weekdays show **higher volume, prioritize trading on those days** over ones with lower volume. in this report, Wednesday's and Thursday's have the highest average volume.

if volume is even throughout the week, **prioritize trading on the days with the highest range**. in this report, Wednesday's and Thursday's have the highest average range.

**pro tip:**

it's much easier to catch a small piece of a bigger move, than a bigger piece of a smaller move. trade on days with bigger moves ‚Äì the highest average range!

understanding volume around economic data announcements:

high **volume** means there are a lot of people buying and selling. this generally provides price movements with more follow-through, rather than choppy movements.

when moves have more follow-through they generally move nicely in one direction, making it easier to take advantage of. choppy price action is more difficult to be profitable in because you're more likely to get faked out. it's easier to make money when volume is high.

why volume matters:

looking at average volume will help you determine **what days provide the best opportunity to**take profitable trades, and what days to avoid to limit losing trades.

breakdown of the economic data volume report:

this shows volume leading up to CPI. sometimes volume will drop the day before important announcements. generally, lower volume environments don't provide the best trading opportunities.

some economic data may not affect volume, but others definitely will.

this report shows 5 days of volume leading up to an economic announcement, as well as the volume of the day of release.

**pro tip:** if volume is generally lower the day before, it may be best to avoid trading ‚Äì but if volume is high, it may be a good day to trade.",2023-10-08,2,0

127a0hx_AMD,AMD,Intel Gains 6% GPU market share to almost match AMD in less than a year.,"Intel new GPUs are apparently very successful.in less than year after Intel released ARC GPU

Intel is already getting very close to AMD market share with 6% -

[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-looks-to-be-catching-up-with-amd-discrete-gpu-matket-share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-looks-to-be-catching-up-with-amd-discrete-gpu-matket-share)

AMD market share in comparison is 9%

Nvidia is still the leader with above 80% of the Discrete GPU market share.

Intel goal at the moment is to gain enough GPU market share to beat Nvidia

and become the leader in the GPU market.

And this might be possible.

Gamers are very enthusiastic about Intel new GPU Battlemage.

123kj43_AMD,AMD,"AMD has rebounded to $100, and it‚Äôs just the beginning","With [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) stock price approaching all-time high, it could be also a good time to invest in AMD, which once hit an all-time high of $161 in November 2021.

Stone Fox Capital believes chip demand should back to growing mode as the inventory adjustment comes to an end. The company is strongly bullish on AMD, saying with the stock only rebounding to $100, it should has plenty of upside in the next few years.

[AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) shares had once fallen all the way to a history low of under $55, and its data center CPU market share still has nowhere near Intel. As the market expected industries such as personal computers to start recovering, AMD rallied all the way to $100.

Counterpoint Research estimates that AMD holds about 20% of data centre CPU market in 2022, up from nearly 12% in 2021. In 2022, AMD generated $5.75 billion in revenue from data centre CPUs. If the company doubles its market share to 40%, its revenue will jump to $11.5 billion, while Intel holds a 50% market share.

With the launch of the new chips, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is expected to benefit from the huge demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential market size for AMD could soar from US$79 billion in 2020 to US$300 billion in 2027.

And getting back to $100 is only the beginning, as this is where it should be in last year.

Stone Fox Capital believes that [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is on track to gain another $100 in the next few years, considering its P/E ratio is still less than half of Nvidia's expected P/E ratio.

Prior to the PC inventory adjustment, AMD's gross margins were close to around 50%. Higher margins and total revenue is driving the company's eps rising significantly.

Analysts have lowered their eps targets due to the weak demand environment and are now targeting above $4 and $5 for 2024 and 2025 respectively. Considering that these estimates are based on limited revenue growth expectations, there is still room for further growing.

Anyway, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327)'s shares are trading at just 23 times of its 2024 eps target. Stone Fox Capital's previous research showed that AMD's revenue was only US$32 billion, but its eps was close to $6. Stone Fox expects the chip company to reach its target level much sooner than analysts had predicted due to a rebound in end market demand, and AMD taking more market share from Intel in the server market.

Here‚Äôs how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ending in December:

EPS: $0.69, adjusted, versus $0.67 per share expected

Revenue: $5.6 billion, versus $5.5 billion expected


AMD said it expected $5.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, slightly lower than a Refinitiv estimate of $5.47 billion. AMD‚Äôs estimate suggests a 10% decline in sales in the current quarter. It also said it expected its adjusted gross margin to be about 50%, a key metric for chipmakers like AMD.

AMD reported earnings as many of its rival chipmakers have stumbled in recent weeks, citing lower consumer demand for finished electronics and gluts of parts needed to make PCs and servers. Intel, AMD‚Äôs primary competitor, reported a disastrous quarter last week that included a weak 2023 outlook.

While AMD said it saw slow sales for its PC chips and graphics processors, it said its data center segment rose 42% year-over-year, suggesting it took market share from Intel.

AMD attributed its beat to strong growth in its embedded and data center businesses, and said that its client revenue, or chips for PCs and laptops, and its gaming segment were down.

AMD‚Äôs data center segment rose 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Its embedded segment grew 1,868%, AMD said, because of sales from its purchase of Xilinx.

AMD‚Äôs gaming business, which is comprised of graphics cards and chips for gaming consoles, was down 7% year-over-year. The decrease came from graphics cards and was offset by ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù revenue, which is what the company calls its chips for systems like the PlayStation 5.",2023-01-31,364,78

10ok3il_META,META,"Expected Moves this Week: FOMC, Payrolls and Earnings from Apple, Amazon, Meta, AMD, Apple and more.","## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì The rally continued.**

SPY rallied 2.5% last week, a 1% move more than the 1.5% move options were pricing. The VIX was down slightly and at 18.50 is now the lowest it has been in the past year.

**This Week ‚Äì All eyes on the Fed, big cap tech reports and NFP**

As mentioned, the VIX was lower last week on the heels of a 2.5% market rally. However, this week sees the FOMC decision on Wednesday, Non-farm payrolls on Friday and a slew of big-cap tech earnings. All of which could be market-moving. SPY options for the week are pricing about a 2% move, and obviously, with reports from Apple, Amazon, and more, QQQ options are pricing a larger move, nearly 3%. As mentioned here over the past few weeks, traders need to be aware of the overall vol environment as that can set up for underpriced options in names that see earnings misses. The same may be true for economic releases as in recent months a more typical SPY expected move for an FOMC (or CPI in mid-Feb) would have been closer to 3% than this week‚Äôs 2%. Of course, the lower IV we‚Äôre seeing is accompanying a market rally alongside a little more certainty on Fed moves. If the script were to hold (.25 hike and no statement bombs) and the market continued to grind higher through earnings, vol could further compress.

The last time the VIX was lower than now was the Summer of 2021 with a VIX as low as 15. In December 2019, pre-pandemic, the VIX was as low as 13. In other words, IV is as low as it‚Äôs been in a year, but historically it‚Äôs still near average.

# How they stack up against one another

All three companies have reported strong financial performance in recent years, driven by growing demand for their products in areas such as gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence. NVDA has been performing well due to strong demand for gaming and AI, while INTC has been struggling with the slowdown of PC sales and the delay of its 7nm products. AMD has been seeing strong growth in its Ryzen and EPYC product lines, and has been taking market share from INTC.

Overall, all three companies are well-established players in the technology industry with a strong track record of innovation and financial performance. However, NVIDIA and AMD are seen as more growth-oriented companies, while Intel is seen as more of a value play.

# Potential trades

Here are a few short term trade ideas for each of these names to allow you to capture some profit through earnings but also protect against a downward move.

**Least capital intensive: INTC**

Buy 1 $23p, Buy 1 $23.50p, Sell 3 $25.50p all expiring 2/10/23

Make 36% annualized yield unless as long as INTC stays above **$25.49** at maturity **(**\-15% move)

**Highest annualized yield: AMD**

Buy 1 $61p, Buy 3 $62p, Sell 2 $64p, Sell 3 $65p, all expiring 2/3/23

Make 63% annualized yield as long as AMD stays above $65 at maturity (-14% move)

**Variable (can exit early for potentially higher annualized return): NVDA**

Buy 1 $190c, Sell 1 $192.50c, Sell 1 $152.50p, all expiring 2/24/23

Make up to 26% annualized and only start to lose if NVDA drops below $152 at maturity (-20% move)",2023-01-23,9,3

10hyf98_AMD,AMD,"Valuing Semiconductor manufacturers and a look at INTC, AMD, TSM and MU","I would like to build a position in a semiconductor manufacturer as their valuations come under pressure in the downturn for this cycle. I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. 

As I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary.

AMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock.

TSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states.

Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. 

Thoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.",2023-01-21,15,37

# Final Comment

As we can see, AMD is a good and stable company, with huge potential from its fundamentals. We can expect at least 1.91% return in perpetual from this stock if we want to hold it forever, with a probability to see swings between +20% and -20%.

AMD had a high beta compare to the sector and the industry, this makes it riskier and potentially very lucrative than the average peers.

Its P/E is above the industry and the market itself, probably a little bit overvalued.

High profits margin and ROA suggest us a potential growth, same for ROE and ROIC. DuPont Analysis shows a positive 62.87%.

Financial indicators point out the fact that AMD's financials are stable and not in danger in any front in the short and mid run.

We shall take in mind that 2020 and 2021 were outliers years, and due to the lockdown the company had huge profits came with speculative bubble of those two years. The speculative bubble pushed for a positive trend on the company, inflating its price well over its fundamental value. We shall expect to see a regression towards the mean growth range and the price to stabilize to its fundamental, discounting off the hype and trend.

If this company paid dividends, it would have a higher evaluation.

Its **current** fair value is

|Price|Factors considered|
|:-|:-|
|$51.28|WACC + Earning Based growth rate|
|$47.80|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + interest rates of 4%|
|$54.94|WACC + Earning Based growth rate + ROA based growth|
|$50|WACC + Earning Based growth + ROA based growth + interest rates of 4%|
|$86|RRR + Earning Based growth|
|$58.90|RRR + Earning Based growth  + Interest rates of 4%|
|**$58.15**|**Average of all the factors considered**|

&#x200B;

Reminder that this is based on the balance sheet of 2021 business year's end, in fact, growth in revenue is already over expectation, as well as costs one, but net income not yet, still under 1B missing until now, expecting a **net income of 4B EOY**

The company is a Long Hold and have high probability to pay dividends in the future, but as for now, it is **overvalued by 10-15%** due to last year trend. Good buying positions shall be around 50-55 dollars

&#x200B;

weic3d_INTC,INTC,NVDA - AMD - INTC: which of these chips/semi conductor stocks would you prefer to invest in?," US Congress has passed the $52 Billion package Chips-Plus Bill Act and President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law. Intel (INTC) was said to benefit the most from the bill. Among these 3 famous semi-conductor stocks (NVDA-INTC-AMD), which one would you prefer to invest in the most?¬†

The global semiconductor shortage that has left consumers waiting on coffee makers, computers, cars and medical devices ‚Äî anything with a computer chip ‚Äî might have an end in sight.

After three years of stops and starts, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $52 billion package last week designed to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and improve competitiveness with China. The bill passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support, and will now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The bill, known as the CHIPS-plus or Chips and Science Act, addresses concerns expressed by both parties that the U.S. needs to bring the production of these vitally important components back home and rely less on Asia-based manufacturers. Supporters, including companies such as Intel and Global Foundries, argued that the bill was necessary since other countries subsidize their semiconductor industry, making it hard for U.S. companies to compete without help.

Last month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, speaking with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer, emphasized just how critical it is for the U.S. to begin making more chips at home and why passage of the CHIPS Act was central to that happening.

‚ÄúMark my words, if Labor Day comes and goes and this isn‚Äôt passed by Congress, companies will not wait, and they will expand into other countries,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe U.S. will lose out.‚Äù

The bill, of course, doesn‚Äôt preclude U.S. chip makers from also producing in Europe and elsewhere, but it does provide financial incentives to make manufacturing facilities in the U.S. more attractive. Intel has already pledged to build a $20 billion chip plant near Columbus, Ohio. The facility is expected to employ 3,000 workers along with 7,000 temporary construction jobs.

The package making its way to Biden‚Äôs desk has a few components, including $39 billion that would give direct financial assistance to companies building chip manufacturing plants at home. A separate $11 billion is earmarked to advance chip manufacturing research and workforce training, and a $2 billion slice is set aside to move lab innovation into military and other applications.

Spy

The Long Play

\- There are two options for the long play tomorrow, depending on where we open and how volume and price is reacting will be the overall factor if I take either. 

The 1st is we break the 396.50 level and confirm. If this happens I will plan for 401.50 for a sell target

The 2nd is we retest the lows of the box we traded in today (392.90) and get bought back up on some bullish volume, I will plan to sell into the top of the range if this happens (396)

&#x200B;

The Short Play

\- We stay trading in today's box of 396 to 393, if price action and volume is setting up at the top of the range, I will be expecting a pull back to the bottom where I will be covering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yygyixwlotc91.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee88b6dc534b0463ad94d2737ce0b8fb0484d4d

&#x200B;

AMD

The Long Play

\- We hold and confirm over 89.40s and have room up to 94.75 for a gap close as the big target, the soft target would be 92 as this also a very key level (the opposing side of the gap). This setup looks very similar to how spy looked coming into today.

&#x200B;

Side Note:

These moves are what I see as possibilities not absolutes, I am not just buying calls blindly expecting things to go my way, these are my key levels where I want price action/volume to confirm for me to take the trade. Always respect your risk because no one has a crystal ball that can tell them every move that is going to happen, that is why we take high RR trades so you don't have to worry about always being right.",2022-07-21,9,9
w29flo_AMD,AMD,7-18-22 Spy/ ES Futures and AMD Daily TA,"So let me get this straight‚Ä¶ we had nothing but terrible news all week last week but ole Apple drops a news nugget about hiring slowing and market capitulates itself? What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense‚Ä¶. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. 

Now the question is‚Ä¶. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my opinion‚Ä¶ Ta wise it could go either way. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/knmqqq4vzdc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa0b82893c3945a797670316d0f9c0a217dde102

If you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ts7pfdewzdc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aebba8a453ff6adbab57c2558e35753c9a0692e

Now the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. 

Looking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. 

https://preview.redd.it/s3y0u5jxzdc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c70967916ddd099a0f8b6496a184814382856e

And then we have the vix‚Ä¶ it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today‚Ä¶ I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn‚Äôt quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. 

I still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn‚Äôt anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5y1wtuyzdc91.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8837a5199d081a89e759f93f85f080884d8901f

I also would be careful until this  breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed‚Ä¶ but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. 

Bull case for SPY/ ES-

Despite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. 

Bear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a <$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now

Daily support for SPY- 382 -> 378.8 -> 375.1 -> 370.6

Daily support for ES- 3795 -> 3744 -> 3671

Daily resistance for SPY- 385 -> 387.3 -> 390.3

Daily resistance for ES- 3915 -> 4020

I feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven‚Äôt had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. 

Overall I see two scenarios

1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. 

2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX >26.6 to believe in it though.

AMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn‚Äôt get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn‚Äôt on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer‚Ä¶ it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. 

Days like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that ‚Äúwell if I just hold them imma get green.‚Äù And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. 

Todays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. 

Also had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure.

My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",2022-04-03,716,293

swiqsa_AMD,AMD,Why AMD is a bad buy,"I love inculcating an image of stupidity. As the Bible says. The wise shall be deemed foolish. I can't convert AMD cultists, I don't care to and I don't relish, like their fellow FB cultists or PTON cultists, their inevitable demise. It is just inevitable.

Here's reasons why that none of them can answer, and I've tried to ring an answer out of them but they refuse to give good answers sticking to really basic sales pitches...which is sad.

First, AMD acquisition in XINLINX doesn't compete in the same space as INTELs FPGA. I'm personally bullish on INTC in this space because theirs are used in industrial applications including automotive. Where the chip shortage is.

As far as I can tell shopping around for XILINX it's largely used by applications developers and is a sort of Walmart of FPGAs with no good application in industrial uses.

Second, AMD chips aren't better than INTC. That's just marketing crap and that's INTCs fault. Their benchmarks have pros and cons depending on what uses you want. The only area I can see a competitive advantage for AMD is in niche crypto mining spaces for its larger cache. The fact that AMD bulls ignore this or claim it can't be true just furthers my belief they are cultists and don't actually know next to anything about chips that they think they know. 

Third, this is the last straw but data center dominance. This is so abstract but true. There has been a huge rise of use of AMD chips and Linux in both Azure cloud and AWS. Which can only point to crypto mining. But I frankly don't care to prove that any more. The real brass tacks comes from trying to buy cloud infrastructure from Azure and AWS. AMD are grossly under provisioned. Which tells me ONE THING.

The ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.

Azure and AWS are OVERPROVISIONED on AMD chips.

They overbought them. That means that in the future AMD chips will be underbought. 

I don't give one flying fyck how good AMD sales growth was last year. Last 10 years.

I know how to buy a fycking server cluster.

You cannot explain why AMD platforms are underprovisioned EXCEPT that Azure and AWS over bought and they are unwilling to provision more resources in the same way a person buys a bad property and quickly realizes its not worth dumping more money into.

I don't know why cloud services went heavy into AMD. Maybe chip shortage and over expansion. 

Intel had a problem providing enough chips.

I frankly don't care.

I don't know if it will be next quarter because of crypto crash. Or a few quarters as DCs stop buying AMD chips because they have too many.

But that's an obvious obvious fact.

So someday in the near future there's a reckoning coming to AMD. I wouldn't short it. No point when right now you can just short SPY and win.

But it's a bad buy. And cultists just don't know how to ask any real questions.",2022-02-19,0,22
swdk8x_AMD,AMD,AMD surpasses INTC market cap.. Any thoughts?,"This is bananas, there's definetely things to dislike about how much intel is depressing margins and spending, but it's gotten battered lately!

The likelihood of a good execution seems to be the main concern for most investors, probably explains the 9 P/E while other chip plays are trading north of 30x earnings.

Does anyone hold any intel? What may be your bull/bear thesis?

I hold around 8-10% of my portfolio in them, I think the risk/reward is favorable if cash flows go back to 2020 levels and increase single digit from there over the next 10 years. If we see them execute this plan, and they grow revenues 7-10% and profit margins return to the 55% or higher there's a lot of upside in the potential for a multiple expansion (p/e increase to 15x as there's more optimism)

sia3el_AMD,AMD,I think AMD has a crypto problem,"Kind of speculative claim but....I've been very tempted into investing in AMD. To quote Will Ferro from Zoolander, ""...he's so hot right now.""

But, things keep coming up that I think are problems. If someone is getting super muscular super fast and winning competitions they never won before...that's when it's good to start checking them for steroids.

I'm almost certain a lot of AMDs sales are going specifically to Monero mining.

I know Lisa Su is quoted as saying she doesn't care who is buying their product, specifically when asked if it was cryptominers, specifically because if crypto implodes so does your sales.

Her answer suggests she does know and doesn't want to admit it and isn't legally obliged to.

But first, the Epyc is great for monero and cheap to scale in Azure. And uses Linux.

Thus I find it suspicious that MSFT Azure admits that strangely there's more Linux instances than Windows instances. Linux OS's are only 13.6% of all servers.

So who is packing them onto AMD cpus on Azure?

Anyway.

If true then AMDs revenues will have tanked in Q1 and especially Q2 because Crypto has tanked and will stay tanked because of rate hikes and falling inflation (assuming it falls).

I can't find industrial scale applications that prefer AMD to Intel. They are nearly equivalent. I'm tired of people giving me the cult answer they arent. I've talked to industry experts. I've made my mind up on that.

And I tried and tried to figure out why Azure doesn't sell as much RAM for AMD instances and it makes sense if for years their customers need small RAM applications to mine Monero or Raptoreum etc, especially Monero which lost less against BTC....

Then to me it makes more sense that AMD is being bought by Cryptominers.

They say AI and some other compute intensive applications are what AMD is used for...but let's face the facts. No one is massively into AI. That TAM is tiny.

Crypto just experienced a huge boom-bust cycle. Enough that BTC mining companies raised $10s of billions in the last year in SPACs.",2022-02-02,0,13
sieb3y_AMD,AMD,Is AMD Xilinx merger good given China's restrictions?,"TL:DR - I think there's a significant geopolitical problem with the restrictions China placed on AMD to allow the merger. China basically wants AMD to choose in a quarrel, China or the US....not a good place to be as any business.

I have been picking on AMD lately but a large reason has been that I had been interested in the stock for about a year. And I had traded even riskier trades before. Now that this is a risk off market....I'm looking for a less risky, risk play. You know, something with seemingly more value but still growing massively. This led me to scrutinize AMD more than I had previously. Others may think I don't do proper DD, sometimes I don't have enough time and I throw out controversy to get responses and that provides a lot of return information. Sorry if that bothers you but it's super useful for me. I'll try and give back some effort now.

I've really started to dive deep into the XILINX deal and it seems to suck.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/wccftech.com/amd-bound-to-make-products-compatible-with-chinese-market-as-part-of-xilinx-approval/amp/

Source for Xilinx-AMD.

There's some problems with this deal. Namely the ""must work with ARM"" part of the deal.

I've said it time and again, my biggest problem with AMD is its exposure to US sanctions against any Chinese compromised products. At first this applied to my worst case scenario with TSM where the US shuts out TSM from the US market.

But it gets worse than that....and I didn't think it could.

But China looks to be setting up AMD as a proxy for geopolitical battles over x86/ARM sanctions that the US uses as a political tool against Chinese aggression.

These arbitrary demands did not exist against Intel-Altera merger....probably because in 2015 China didn't have the urgent need to address the issue. China has a tenous existence with rule of law but to some extent it enforces the rule of law consistently enough to encourage foreign cooperation. 

As far as I can tell, China has not changed the terms of FPGA sales to China.

However China has grabbed AMD by the balls...or grabbed Lisa Su by the *Trump phrase*...

AMD to merge with Xilinx and do ANY BUSINESS with China must surrender AMDs ability to comply with US geopolitical demands.

The US isn't going to treat AMD with kid gloves. If that's the deal they want to make....

But if the US finds any need to further sanction China's access to semiconductors, AMD has to choose.

US or China...and I'll let you guess where most of AMDs business comes from.

That's true of Intel as well. But I've had a hunch that the reason Gelsinger is 110% going for huge Fab infrastructure in the US is that the US wants to smash the chip market in China and anything associated with China.

That's a problem if your Chips comes from Taiwan since they can be compromised.

But it's an even bigger problem with this merger. 

Now, there's one other problem I think. 

The bundling...

As far as I can tell Intel doesn't have the same restriction that they cannot bundle Altera clients to Intel products in China and vice versa.

But China did slap AMD with that restriction.

I don't have the confirmation on the Intel side I want yet...but if there is a disparity it suggests a Chinese preference for chips. I wouldn't guess why...just that it's there now and will manifest itself over time.",2022-02-02,0,19

#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA

>""Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today"" - Wells Fargo analyst

Nvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.

# Q2 Earnings

Almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue ‚Äî all those RTX 30 series graphics cards ‚Äî hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.

# Crypto Market dependence

When of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company‚Äôs estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.

For Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**

# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment

NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates¬†that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. 

# Arm Deal

Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.

# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD

AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record¬†50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.

#  Q2 Earnings And Growth

On July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform ""Steam"" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded¬†30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.

#  Video Games Potential Growth

Video game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from¬†last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected¬†to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected¬†to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.

**AMD** supplies¬†semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell¬†25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.

# Xilinx Acquisition

AMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx¬†is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.

# Intel ~ $INTC

Intel‚Äôs stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It‚Äôs struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.

Intel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.

[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)

#  New CEO = New Future?

Intel‚Äôs new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.

If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.

# GPUs War

Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

#  My Conclusion

In my opinion, Intel is pretty much out of the race, even if the new CEO will shake things up, Intel will take a long time until climbing back up.

I think that the better choice is between the fast-growing semiconductor stocks, **NVIDIA** or **AMD**. Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.

>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

>The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

>Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvda/amd's surge to capture Intel market share?

*edited to add* [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-amd-polaris-supercomputer-department-of-energy) also interpreted the DOE's purchase of the Nvidia-AMD machine as being caused by Intel's delay.",2021-08-25,1835,198

otv8dv_AMD,AMD,I‚Äôm up over 20% on AMD. Would you sell?,"Update below

I bought the AMD dip into my longterm portfolio (tax free) and since then I am up a lot. Is it realistic to expect AMD to keep going up for the rest of the year or can I sell now and buy back in later for less? 

Position: 8 shares

EDIT:

Update: Thank you everyone who replied. I got a lot of good advice and interesting perspectives. Nearly all were helpful or at least good natured. Here‚Äôs some of the recommendations I received: 

- Hold and buy dips because fundamentals and leadership suggest AMD will only keep going up 

- Sell and reallocate to a position that I have more confidence in

- Sell all and put in ETFs / Index funds for long term steady growth 

- Sell part and keep the rest - sell a % or take back my initial deposit so I am not sweating it, playing with free money

- Sell all and buy LEAPS

- Open a position with a plan so I don‚Äôt have to ask people on the internet what to do with my money.

I decided to sell 2 of my shares so I have some cash on hand. I have maxed out my tax advantage account for the year so the $200 might help if a high conviction play takes a hit. I am ready to put more into AMD if the price drops. Maybe I will even buy calls in my trading account. 

By far my biggest take away is that people have a lot of faith in AMD with Su at the helm. Thanks again everyone for your insight and your patience with a relatively inexperienced / nervous investor",2021-07-29,142,277

oqhu9k_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Some big mover earnings next week. $AAPL, $TSLA, $SBUX, $GOOGL, $AMD..... It's a big week, let's talk strategy folks","1) Strategy
I recently was introduced to how to properly make use of a credit spread around earnings. It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?

2) Plays
Based on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week. I appreciate all constructive feedback. Or even non constructive. 
$AAPL DOWN 4%
$TSLA DOWN 5%
$SBUX UP 3%
$AMD DOWN 1% then UP next day 4%
$GOOGL ? %2

I have some light DD on these I am willing to debate with people, brings on your thoughts or any other juicy looking low hanging fruit for next week. I don't have a large account for next week's plays so I will probably pick the 2 I think most likely to print from different sectors and maybe a small call or put on an index containing one of them. Or maybe a collaborative play on QQQ going down as a lot of the names I am interested in are tech companies.

Edit.. after some more DD I'm gonna throw $F in the ring for at Down 4%. This is based mostly on looking at big news items that effect collaborative stocks (Tsla, gm, nio, etc.). While the others seem to have a reaction to news, $F seems to be immune from good news giving it a boost. To date the shares of $F have done fairly well this year, especially considering their recent financial troubles the past couple years. Any thoughts?",2021-07-24,204,176

nbc7cr_AMD,AMD,PRESS RELEASE: Protokinetix (OTCQB: PKTX) partners with IQVIA to develop clinical trials for Dry Eye Disease and AMD,"Protokinetix has entered a collaboration with life sciences technology giant  IQVIA (NYSE: [**IQV**](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:IQV)) to develop clinical trials using the AAGP molecule to treat two common eye diseases -- Dry Eye Disease  and Wet and Dry forms of Age-related Macular Degeneration.  


This a big deal.  These two diseases affect millions of people and have no effective treatment.   IQVIA is an industry leader with $12B revenues.  IQVIA clearly believes that Protokinetix‚Äôs AAGP molecule offers a potential breakthrough treatment for both diseases.  Here‚Äôs why:

¬∑ **Dry Eye Disease:**    Dry Eye Disease is caused by inflammation.  Current drugs for Dry Eye Disease, such as Restasis and Xiidra,  do not stop inflammation.  Also, they irritate the eyes and have other side effects (for example, Xiidra is banned in Europe).  AAGP completely stops inflammation, does not irritate the eye and is non-toxic.   Protokinetix has completed all preliminary tests with excellent results.  Novartis bought Xiidra for $3.4B.  What would a real cure be worth?  

¬∑ **AMD:**  Blindness is generally caused by dead or non-functional retinal cells.  Many teams are trying to cure blindness by transplanting stem cells into blind retinas in the hope that these cells will develop into functioning retinal cells.  The problem is that the transplanted cells die after a few days.   However, if you treat these cells with AAGP, they not only survive but they develop into fully functioning retinal cells, thereby restoring vision.   Dr. Gregory-Evans (Julia Levy Leadership Chair in Macular Research at University of British Columbia) has successfully restored vision in genetically blind mice and rabbits by transplanting AAGP-treated human stem cells into their retinas.  The same technique should be able to restore vision to blind people.

Everything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.

I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  
""This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.""

One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers ""digesting"" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.

One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.

One could speculate that the ""chip shortage"" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.

All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.

With AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.

Microsoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be.

To this day, Xbox remains the only console that requires an Xbox Live membership to play free-to-play games, including games such as Warzone.

Does it stand a chance to soar on this or are we looking at a small chicken hop on announcement like the new ryzen 5000 release? 

Where should I be researching? What do more experienced people know already? 

Thanks!",2020-10-13,3,7

it176s_AMD,AMD,Sony reduces PS5 production by 26.7% due to AMD chip issue," According to Bloomberg, there is a low yield issue with the SOC chip in PS5 (as low as 50% yield). As the result, Sony will have to cut its PS5 production by 26.7%. As we know, AMD provides those SOC chips (custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and custom GPU based on AMD‚Äôs RDNA 2 architecture), and those chips are manufactured with TSMC 7nm process.

Since AMD's upcoming Zen 3 and Big Navi also use TSMC 7nm, will there be yield issue for Zen 3 and Big Navi too? Probably yes.

Will this cause AMD and TSMC stocks to drop? Maybe.

If we keep seeing news like this coming out in the next few weeks, obviously it's not good for any of these companies. So take this into consideration for your next play - don't just YOLO thinking the market has finally turned around.

it7nbn_AMD,AMD,"Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC"," This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that‚Äôs not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it‚Äôs incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging ‚Äì essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world ‚Äì as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs ‚Äì a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‚Äòworkers‚Äô more productive in smaller spaces ‚Äì first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we‚Äôre now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it‚Äôs extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they‚Äôre specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that‚Äôs not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‚Äòmonolithic‚Äô , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they‚Äôre  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that‚Äôs widely used right now (notably in  AMD‚Äôs Zen 2 architecture), has an ‚Äòinterposer‚Äô sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we‚Äôll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it‚Äôs likely that they‚Äôre using TSMC‚Äôs  CoWoS ‚Äì Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster ‚Äì each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won‚Äôt have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‚Äòstuck‚Äô, as you  would with AMD‚Äôs approach, it‚Äôs harder to design products for ‚Äì you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies‚Äô philosophies. AMD‚Äôs  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel‚Äôs EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it‚Äôs successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it‚Äôs  evident that each company has chosen the approach that‚Äôs best for it ‚Äì  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD‚Äôs smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD‚Äôs  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‚Äòconcrete  foundation‚Äô is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. ‚Äì just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they‚Äôre sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‚Äòteams‚Äô have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it‚Äôll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it‚Äôs easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its‚Äô ‚ÄòFoveros‚Äô stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‚ÄòX-cube‚Äô packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‚Äò3DFabric‚Äô family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‚Äòtrue‚Äô 3D stacking ‚Äì where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn‚Äôt far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now ‚Äì TSMC‚Äôs SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips ‚Äì especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc‚Äôs 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power ‚Äì an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel‚Äôs  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it‚Äôs apparent  that it‚Äôs extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies ‚Äì either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips ‚Äì for instance  Samsung‚Äôs newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We‚Äôre likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‚ÄòHoly Grail‚Äô of high-power logic on logic ‚Äì  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it‚Äôs impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive ‚Äì even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn‚Äôt I going to tell you  why Intel‚Äôs future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn‚Äôt it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel‚Äôs future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its‚Äô infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we‚Äôre at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it‚Äôs easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‚Äòwon‚Äô the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel‚Äôs operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it‚Äôs likely  that Intel‚Äôs spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel‚Äôs engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It‚Äôs current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel‚Äôs  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback ‚Äì a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I‚Äôm investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

Feel free to contact me if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôd like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

ii5c3s_AMD,AMD,Question about Graham Number considering MFGP and AMD,"Hi all,

I am **very** new to security analysis and just came across Graham Number which says you can consider investing in a company if P/E \* P/BV < 22.5 given a large market cap.

I was looking at some stocks for an example and came across two different worlds.

&#x200B;

* MFGP which currently has P/E=1.03 and P/BV=0.21, with a large market cap. Which seems insane according to this heuristic formula, but all the advisors advising sell until recently and stock price trending down.
* AMD which currently has P/E=166.6 and P/BV=29.72, with a large market cap. Which seems also insane on the other end of the spectrum, but advisors are advising buy and stock is breaking record prices.

My question is why is there such a discrepency? It seems to me like if MFGP should be very safe to invest in even if they fail considering their P/BV, whereas for AMD, even if they 10folded their earnings next year, would be a bad stock for current price.

&#x200B;

If can anyone give me some insight on this I would be very grateful. Cheers.",2020-08-28,23,15

1. Lisa Su (CEO): sold $11.8M worth of AMD stock in Aug 11, and sold $4.1M in Aug 9.
2. KUMAR DEVINDER (CFO): sold $5M in Aug 11, and sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
3. Bergman Rick (EVP): $1.9M in Aug 9.
4. Papermaster Mark D (CTO): sold $1.25M in Aug 9.

7. WOLIN HARRY A (SVP): sold $698k in Aug 9.
8. SMITH DARLA M (CAO): sold $332k in Aug 9.

That is a total of $28.4M in 2 days, which is a lot of profit-taking for a short amount of time.

Will this trend continue as AMD price keeps hitting ATH? Quite possible. This means that more volatility is coming for AMD, which we have already seen recently with all these crazy swings. So don't YOLO/FOMO into AMD because of all the hype.

I was a broke kid a few years ago, got the robinhood app, knew nothing about stocks, got a few shares of AMD for $1.81 each and promptly forgot to check my robinhood for years. Flashforward to now and I'm stoked I never looked cause they're up over $80 now and I probably would have sold them long ago. My imposisble to answer question is, at what point would you normally sell stocks that are up this much? 

I have been enjoying robinhood lately and use it a lot now as I'm trying to learn more about trading etc.

i3mq5j_AMD,AMD,$OSS - Likely to Run Soon - Leaks from AMD/NVIDIA and earnings this Thursday.,"I firmly expect $OSS to climb into earnings this Thursday and potentially beyond, and I have statistics + leaks from AMD/NVIDIA to support my argument.


When you review their [partnerships](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners) and [financial statements](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-013196/0001564590-20-013196.pdf), you start to wonder if their stock price is some kind of joke. They are very clearly doing much better than 95% of the pennystocks mentioned on this subreddit and have an array of high-level connections in their industry. In short, they're not struggling.


NVIDIA cites them as a ""[top system maker](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2050975/0/en/World-s-Top-System-Makers-Unveil-NVIDIA-A100-Powered-Servers-to-Accelerate-AI-Data-Science-and-Scientific-Computing.html)"" and are officially one of NVIDIA's [Preferred Manufacturers](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus).


It's rare for a company this young to perform at such a high level. By their SECOND YEAR, they generated $60 million in revenue (57% increase YoY) and already had multiple profitable quarters, which is unheard of on this subreddit. For comparison, they make 60x as much as GNUS, but get 1/60th of the attention.

\------------------------------------------

# Three Catalysts - Pick your Weapon:


1. Q2 earnings this Thursday, August 6th - Their past earnings have been very very strong. They're also going to discuss company developments.


2. Upcoming Siggraph 2020 tech conference (August 17-24) - A showcase of new military-grade Nvidia workstations/datacenters and Nvme PCIe storage/flash products)


3. Caught in the middle of a dick-measuring contest between AMD/NVIDIA, who both have new GPU architectures coming out (partnered with both). This is a situation that's going to unfold over time. As an OEM for both companies who are targeting PCIe 4.0 systems, OSS is going to be very pleased.


**PROMISED LEAKS:**

OSS currently holds the [first and only PCIe 4.0 server expansion system](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/164/oss-introduces-worlds-first-pcie-gen-4-expansion-system) that's compatible with Nvidia's A-100 card, the [most powerful GPU in the world](https://www.techpowerup.com/270338/nvidia-ampere-a100-gpu-gets-benchmark-and-takes-the-crown-of-the-fastest-gpu-in-the-world). (benchmarked last week. Highest Octanebench score ever recorded.)

The CEO hinted that AMD's MI100 would be soon to follow, as [leaks from AMD](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-cdna-and-mi100-presentation-slides-leak/) are showing specs and the clear intention to target PCIe 4.0 server systems, which OSS currently holds a substantial amount of market share in.

\-------------------------------------------

I could write a novel on this company, but I'm not going to bother. They will do well whether we talk about them or not.

They recently hired a new CEO, who's led two companies in the same industry to record revenues and one was bought out entirely by Broadcom. He also receives a [massive salary bonus](https://imgur.com/MPDnP9c) if the stock price reaches $5.50. It's clear what their intentions are.

The CEO did an interview yesterday where he mentioned that they had ""0 Covid cases on the production line"", which further bolsters my personal prediction that their quarterly/annual earnings should be very strong given covid circumstances.

\------------------------------------------

I am in this until Thursday (or through Thursday and into the conference, depending on ER). I am 100% holding, and you can check back with me each day if you'd like to see how I feel about the company and the chart.

Backstory:

I am a retired surgeon who transitioned to a full time day trader. I focus on a single ticker with only occasional deviations to other companies. My intra-day trades usually last less than 1 minute. Swing trades are between 1 week to a few months. Since 2008, I have never lost money in a calendar year. My goal was 7 figures last year which I achieved. I lowered that goal to a more attainable 500k this year which is technically achieved right now but not completely realized. I trade stocks and options (I sell a ton of calls to you guys here).

&#x200B;

Edit:

I started buying mutual finds in high school. Then, dot-com hit and I traded tech stocks. It was expensive. Broker assisted trades were $125 per trade back then. Then online trading started at $30 per trade. I took $2,000 and turned it into over $150,000, and then lost most of it. I got greedy. I learned (the hard way) to set goals early and book profits when goals were met. Risk management was the next hard lesson to learn. Eventually, I decided to go to med school and used all my trading profits to fund school. I continued to trade during school and graduated debt free. I moved to the USA in 2008 with virtually nothing and started from scratch again. I saved enough to open a brokerage account with a few thousand dollars. It took 18 months of slow trading to get to over 25K and finally I could day trade without dealing with PDT rules. And here we are now.",2020-07-29,3052,567

hy3mgo_AMD,AMD,Why is Intel losing to AMD & people just realized it now?,"Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)

When you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electrical engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?

Intel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map & product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.

This also separates the difference between value investing & growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.

There will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues & earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.

**AMD ‚Äì Advanced Micro Devices**

AMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There‚Äôs been an uptick in the semi‚Äôs as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.

**DKNG ‚Äì DraftKings**

Draftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.

**KO ‚Äì Coca Cola**

Big call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn‚Äôt have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.

**INTC ‚Äì Intel Corporation**

I caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It‚Äôs possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.

**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**

Didn‚Äôt spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven‚Äôt seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We‚Äôll find out this week.

eqlhrt_AMD,AMD,[Learning] Buying AMD $55 call expiring Jan 31 - Walk me through your logic?,"Hey y'all. New options trader here. I'll lay out my line of reasoning for wanting to buy this call, and whether you agree or disagree, I ask that you please explain why. I've gotten a pretty solid understanding of the basic concepts of option trading, but I'm really trying to understand how to apply that in real-world application.

\*\*AMD current price: $50.83\*\*

Based on the extensive research I've done, AMD's gain has consistently defied both analyst and investor expectations over the past year. Every recent article seems to be nothing but good news about the company, from management hires to new technology and increased investor confidence. 2019 Q4 earnings are set to be reported on the Jan 28th - three days before this call expires - and EPS is estimated on Robinhood to be $0.31, which is $0.10 higher than Q3s actual.

The only piece of information I've found that makes me hesitate was a single sentence in an article from an analyst who gave AMD a hold rating, who said that their main bull run is over. However, it seems like anyone who has said that in the past year has been wrong.

So, does this seem like a relatively good pick at this point? Why or why not? I know Delta and Theta aren't great, but are they bad enough to not buy this call?  


Edit: Wow, thanks for the massive amount of replies to this. I've already learned a ton more, which is exactly what I was hoping to do! As it stands, if I do buy this call, it would be with the intent of 100% selling it back before earnings are announced for hopefully a small profit. Not at all planning on holding it to expiration.

Edit 2: I bought it at $1.07 for the reasons listed above. It jumped up to a $30 profit almost immediately this morning and I learned my lesson about not being greedy...currently at a $3 profit. In Su‚Äôs name I pray. 

Edit 3: Sold the option for a $16 profit and bought the exact same call when it dropped down to $1.10...price of underlying stock has moved 2%+ since Intel announced earnings and its now at $52.63. Can‚Äôt wait to see how much this premium is worth when the market opens again!

Final update: sold that for a $22 profit. Chump change for many, but it worked out in the end!

cnq6gm_AMD,AMD,AMD Put Credit Spread... Did I do anything wrong or just get unlucky?,"On July 30th right before earnings, I bought 2 AMD Put Credit Spreads ($31.50-$33.00). The current Price of the stock was around $33.60. The Credit Spreads expired August 9th (tomorrow). So I would lose around $180 if AMD closed below $31.50 at expiration... and I would gain $120 if AMD closed above $33.00 at expiration.  


Soon after I bought the credit spread AMD stock dropped a large amount. On August 5th the stock price was $27.86.  


On the same day (August 5th) I get a notification that my $33 put was assigned... shortly after that another notification that my $31.50 put was exercised to cover that. Leaving me with the $180 loss.  


Today AMD is up 16% to 33.75 (at the time of writing this). My credit spread was supposed to expire tomorrow and if AMD Stays above $33 I would have made $120... but since they were assigned & exercised below $31.50 I lost that chance of making money.   


So my question is... Did I just get unlucky in that my puts were assigned/exercised? Or should I have done something differently?",2019-08-08,3,8

68trrx_AMD,AMD,AMD - Lesson in Valuation,"Lets ignore the news and momentum moves and try to understand something about companies and valuations. 

AMD is a money losing business most banked on dying a couple of years ago. For high risk companies like this it is good to think in terms of probabilities. 

If the companies dies it has little debt and probably enough IP to be worth 3-4 billion. If the company recovers, what would it look like? 

Looking at its major competitor, NVDA, Nvidia has around USD7 billion in revenues and about a 27% EBITDA margin, and is trading around 26x EBITDA. 

If we want to look at what AMD may look like on a recovered basis, lets say revenue grows 50% from USD4.3 bn to USD6.4 billion at some point and lets say EBITDA margins recovers to 25% and it trades at 20x EBITDA, it would imply a market cap of around USD32 billion. 

Looking at recent pricing action, the shares were trading around 14.5~ which implied around a 14 billion market cap in March, which meant investors were pricing a 40-45% chance of recovery. The recent pricing action suggest investors are losing some faith, with that implied probability now falling to 30%.

As for what AMD should be valued at, plug in your own probabilities and determine your own valuation. I have no special insights greater than the market. ",2017-05-02,72,63

5vm6s1_AMD,AMD,[DD] Some arguments against $AMD,"So I know that everyone is bullish (for the most part) on AMD, but I think we might see a decent correction in the future. And I want to give a disclaimer: Long term I think AMD is a great bet, and even if Ryzen, Vega and their new server equiptment doesn't do as well as people are hoping, this is still a great step for the company. All I'm saying is that this probably isnt the time to buy. Let's break it down:


**The stock is up 600% and counting on the year**

- The stock was definitely undervalued at this time last year, but for any companies stock to grow 600% in one year is huge.  And one big reason for this is that AMD has pretty much shown all of their cards, through leaks, promotions and benchmarks, so we know everything about how great this new technology is.  And all of that is fantastic for the company, but the problem that I see is that all of this is based on hype and leaks (the leaks most likely are real but I'll explain more later on).  So if everything is true about the company, I don't see it spiking, instead continuing to grow at the rapid pace it is already growing at. 

**They have a lot riding on whether their server chips are going to be a success** 

- AMD's revenue expectations for 2017 aren't effected much by the sales of their consumer chips, its mostly set on their server line of products to be a success. AMD's model of undercutting the competition on price will 100% work on a consumer level, but not on a business level.  I have a few friends in the field of IT, and they explained to me that businesses are able and willing to pay extreme price premiums for something that isn't proportionally better.  A lot of these companies cannot afford to have their servers fail or hiccup on any level, and will pay 25% more for a product for a 5% performance increase.  So my point here, is that AMD needs to flat out beat Intel from a performance standpoint, or a power consumption standpoint.  The amount of power a server draws is extremely important from a heat management, longevity, and cost perspective. 

- So AMD needs to either match the TDP of Intel on a more powerful chip, or beat the TDP of Intel's chips while maintaining the same performance. This is important because if AMD cannot improve on the TDP or performance of Intel's chips, then this isn't going to be as successful and profitable as people think. 

- My final point on this issue is that many companies, especially with something as important as their servers, won't want to incur the costs of transitioning to a completely new platform.   It's extremely costly, so if the chip is only ""just as good"" as their competition it wouldn't be worth it to switch.

**Intel and Nvidia are both very capable of competing with AMD's prices, they just never had to**

- Think about it. Right now Intel and Nvidia are the dominant players, and the only players in the high end CPU and GPU market.  If you want a card that performs better than an RX 480 (AMD's top of the line GPU, retails for ~$200 decent performance) which a lot of people do, you have to go to Nvidia, where they can charge basically whatever they want because they have absolutely zero competition. And as far as CPU's go, AMD is complete garbage and can't even compete with mid range CPU's from Intel.  So while I think this transition for AMD to be more competitive in the high end puts pressure on existing players, such as Nvidia or Intel, I don't think that AMD is going to benefit as greatly from this as people expect. 

- Also, its worth noting that AMD's main seller (in my opinion of course) on the consumer market is going to be their RX 1700, a competitor to Intel's 7700K, coming in around $330, coming in at right about the same price as the 7700k.  Now this chip does have 4 more cores and threads than Intel's offering, but in tasks such as gaming (A large portion of their consumer market) those extra cores aren't going to help performance in many games.  In fact, the fact that it has a lower clock speed would actual have more of a negative impact on games, possibly making it a worse performer than the 7700k.  And beneath that most of the mid-level and entry-level chips don't seem like they're undercutting much, if at all, from Intel, which I think is the area where they are going to see the most sales.  The $500 1800x is great, but for most people they wouldn't be able to take advantage of the extra performance, so why would anyone pay an extra $170?  This is pure speculation of my end but I know a decent amount about computer components, I've built a few computers over the past few years and this all kinda makes sense. 

TLDR: AMD is looking great for the future, but now might not be the time to buy in.  Not hating on them or think they're going to plummet, I'm just trying to make some of the expectations of Ryzen and their server gear more realistic.

NVDA - strong sustained performance. New architecture could lift them even more. However..it went up so much..im not sure if they will explode more.

ARMH - good future. smartphones are here to stay. i owned ARMH when they were 20$.. sold.. ..oh well

AMD - they can't stay at these levels. even though they compete with both nvda and intc..i believe that they should go up. they have some interesting architectures coming up (Zen and the 32 core chip for next year)

INTC - slowed down a bit..especially since they can;t really make a huge play in mobile ..however still a good value stock right ?

3ie1fs_AMD,AMD,AMD set to release new GPU; Is it worth the risk to buy soon while prices are low?,"[Article](http://www.bidnessetc.com/50926-advanced-micro-devices-inc-to-release-r9nano-gpu-this-month/)

According to the article Advanced Micro Devices MAY be dropping their new GPU within a week. If this is true, AMD might be worth loading up on since its already at such a low. It's been bouncing around for a few days now, but with the GPU release possibly coming it could see a good rise. 

Does anyone else think this is worth investing in?
