How much capital would one need to reliably get $4k monthly income from dividend stock/funds? Does the stock price generally stay stable with these kind of funds? Are they less volatile / risky during a bear market then standard 60/40% stock/bond mutual fund or comparable ? Appreciate the feedback

1bfjidb_AMT,AMT,AMT Opinions?,"Hi everyone,

First: I‘m no native speaker, so sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes :). 

I would like to know your opinions for AMT.

Today they officially announced the reduktion of their dividend from 1.7 to 1.62 (on the level of last quarter).
In their earnings call they said, that they want to keep the dividend flat for the fiscal year 2024. So after all it would still grow YoY (but very slightly).
My question is why they did it?
They got a low AFFO-Payout-ratio, so why not stick to the track record? 
Why did they raise it in the first place? I mean it‘s a Reit, they have predictable Cashflow (especially in the Cell Tower sector).
Are they in too much debt? I don‘t think so.

I‘m on the verge of selling, but I‘m not sure.
Any Opinions?",2024-03-15,4,2

163109z_AMT,AMT,AMT vs CCI," 

Thoughts on future growth for these two communication tower REITs. CCI has the (much) higher yield but with AMT I'm drawn to their exposure in emerging markets and the data center sector. I'm fine with a lower div yield if there is a bigger upside.  

40 years old and doing my best to strike a balance building a diversified dividend income and growth portfolio. I also have positions in O, WPC, and VICI.

mobfip_AMT,AMT,American Tower (AMT): the best way to play the coming 5G boom.,"**American Tower**

For those of you that actually enjoy reading a good DD, this one is for you. I have followed Wall Street Bets for a while, and personally, I can’t wait for GameStop and AMC to fade away so people actually get back to posting about long ideas that might be worth my time and money. I know that some of you are busy gambling on dying businesses like GameStop or AMC, but I’m here to let you in on a secret.

The company I will be diving into today is the single best way to play the coming 5G boom in America and the expansion of existing cell networks around the world. American Tower (AMT) is the world’s largest REIT with a market cap just over 100B and they are the largest owner of cell towers in the world. Some of you have already checked out because REITs are for boomers, but AMT is growing fast and is a vital piece of the world’s communication infrastructure. If you think that 5-10 years from now people around the world will own more cell phones, make more phone calls, and use more mobile data, AMT is a great way to get a piece of the growing 5G pie.

AMT builds cell towers around the world and then rents them out to telecommunications companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile (and the international equivalents). American Tower has over 186,000 communications sites in 21 countries around the world. One of the things that has me interested about AMT’s business model is that they can use a single cell tower to provide service for all three major carriers (and have the capacity to support up to 5 networks), which creates huge margins for each tower.

**Valuation**

Over the last year, the share price has fallen from a peak of 260 last summer/fall to around 240. This puts the Price to FFO (P/E for REITs) to around 26, which is about where it usually trades. I expect AMT to trade in the 25-30 P/FFO range as investors realize the long-term growth runway in front of the company, so there might be some multiple expansion left. I expect that the continued growth of earnings and dividends will lead to a significant increase in share price over the next couple years and beyond.

**Dividend Growth**

I know that most people here aren’t looking for dividends, but it is still worth seeing how fast AMT’s dividend has grown. From 2013, the dividend has grown nearly 5x. Again, I get that no one here could give a shit about dividends, but everything else being equal, rising dividends lead to a rising share price. I don’t think we will see the same rapid growth as the last eight years, but I do think AMT will continue to grow the dividend at a decent pace over the next decade.

Short version: Dividends = free tendies. Dividend increases = more free tendies for shareholders.

**Footprint and Competitors**

AMT has a presence on 6 continents, and they continue to grow naturally and through acquisitions. This January they acquired Telxius Towers, which greatly expands their footprint in Europe and Latin America. Post-acquisition, the company said the revenue split will be approximately 51% North America, 10% Europe, 14% Africa, 15% South America, and 10% Asia Pacific.

Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) are the only public competitors of note, but American Tower is bigger and has a larger international presence. You can look into both, but AMT is the best way to get international exposure to 5G.

**Customer Concentration and New Edge Data Centers**

The US telecommunications companies make up about half of AMT’s revenue, so there is some revenue concentration. The demand for data and cell reception is pretty inelastic though, so no matter what happens to AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, AMT will continue to thrive. The cell tower market isn’t exactly a monopoly, but because one tower can serve the whole industry, competitors like CCI and SBAC aren’t likely to build new towers in the same locations as American Tower’s existing towers (and vice versa).

They also recently opened six edge data centers (think Fastly or Cloudflare) to keep up with new and improving technology. This is just the beginning, but for a firm that has the resources of AMT, they could choose to expand rapidly if management likes the opportunity.

**Conclusion**

I work at one of the Big 4 Accounting Firms, so I have a pretty good idea of what businesses are worth investing in and which ones to leave for the smooth brained apes around here. American Tower has the management, growth mindset, and secular tailwinds of 5G that will continue to drive market beating shareholder returns.

I have put about 10% of my Roth IRA into AMT and I spent my whole stimulus check on a couple of Jan2023 300 calls a couple weeks ago. I think AMT is somewhere close to fairly priced currently, but the growth and business model mean that buying at today's prices could look like a bargain in a couple years.

I know that a lot of people are going to keep speculating on GameStop, but eventually that will come to an end. If you guys are fine buying companies that lose shitloads of money and have to issue new shares just to stay afloat, that’s fine, but I prefer to buy pieces of businesses that are profitable. Either way, good luck out there fellas.

m7w344_AMT,AMT,American Tower - 5G Infrastructure Play!,"First let me just say I'm a moron who accidentally built 3 successful companies and am day trading with 2 million dollars... Don't listen to me... I like to gamble on Stonks...

That being said Congress just changed to allow ""Pet Projects"" in the new spending plan... This is a huge 180 and I believe now that we have spending fends in congress they really will spend a massive 2+ trillion dollar infrastructure package.   What's one major infrastructure that needs to be built?  That's right, 5 G Baby!  All of you with an Iphone 12 right now know how crappy 5 G currently is.  I think I get it for 10 seconds as I drive down I-35 in Dallas.

In comes American Tower - Ticker AMT.

First I'd like to point out that AMT has a social sentiment score of 100%... Out of the last 5 Analysts who reported on AMT they all said ""BUY"" with an Avg price target of $275.  Giving us room for a 30% gain from here.   The downside average is literally 1% higher from its current price.

Also please note how FAST it recovered in March of 2020.  I was shocked when I saw that.

My position is Oct $280 calls.  I believe congress approves a 2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill that has massive play for new 5 G towers.  If you are bullish on EV then you MUST be bullish on 5G.  (Plus it rhymes so that means it's going to the damn moon!)

\*This post was satire.  Anything I said was while I was flinging poo with fellow apes.  Good bye.

l17vc5_AMT,AMT,What is happening to $AMT?,"So I have been following the company ‘American Towers’ for a while now. And in my opininion this stock has an amazing value, they just keep on growing and growing. They have a huge portfolio of almost 200000 communication sites. And as 5g will rise these sites will be highly needed. 

With that being said, I can’t help but notice the stockprice keeps going down. And I do not understand why. Is this because the stock is heavily shorted or do people just not believe in 5g anymore? Is there something I don’t know about? I just want to hear your opinions on this.

I read an article about how the race for 5G is making cellphone tower operators an attractive investment (especially $AMT). They have been on an incredible run so far in 2019 and I am wondering if there is more run room left. $AMT has a low beta which makes me feel good considering speculation of a recession that is coming sooner rather than later. Additionally $AMT has solid fundamentals and is positioned the best of the big 3 CPTO.

7udmg5_AMT,AMT,"The roll out of 5G, the IOT and rapid international growth is driving American Tower’s stock price higher","American Tower (AMT), the real estate investment trust that leases space on communications sites and towers is now the biggest REIT in the world with 150,000 sites in its portfolio.  

Its stock price has risen 43% over the past year and now has a yield of just 1.9% - but with the rapid growth in the number of connected devices it doesn’t look like either the business growth or stock price and going to end any time soon.  Orbis Research forecast demand for data will increase by 21% CAGR until 2021.

The demand will be driven primarily by;

- tower companies look set to benefit as networks compete to be first to deliver a 5G network

- the collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger means Sprint will need to invest in its network.  Sprint, which was already being placed last in network quality rankings, has said it will will up its network capex in a big way with reports that it will triple its spend to $5 billion

- this month AT&T announced that all 50 U.S. states had decided to opt into FirstNet, a Federal government-backed communications network that will be built and operated by AT&T to provide connectivity for first responders across the country

- Internationally, American Towers revenues are growing by double digits in every region.  Don’t be fooled by the name, over 70% of AMTs towers and 45% of revenues are generated internationally with a strong focus on India and Brazil.


The stock has seen some great gains recently but with huge prospects, domestic and international, and with AMT's clever targeting of growth markets and fast growing multinational wireless companies -- the outlook for long term growth and for AMT's stock price look bright.

Also with carriers expanding it seems they have no choice but to pay AMT.
