1ktbqy0_GOOGL,GOOGL,Bill Ackman's new bet on AMZN and his new positions,"Billionaire investor Bill Ackman’s hedge fund, [Pershing Square Capital Management](https://pershingsquareholdings.com/), is making headlines again after releasing its latest 13F filing on May 15, 2025. The fund disclosed over $11.9 billion in equity holdings, revealing several bold moves including a high-conviction buy into Amazon and an exit from Canadian Pacific.

**Pershing Square Portfolio Snapshot – Q1 2025**

**Total Portfolio Value:** $11.93 billion

**Top Holdings:**

* **Uber Technologies (UBER):** $2.2 billion (18.5% of portfolio)
* **Brookfield (BN):** $2.1 billion (18.01%)
* **Restaurant Brands International (QSR):** $1.53 billion (12.8%)
* **Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG):** $1.08 billion (9.1%)
* **Alphabet Inc (GOOG/GOOGL):** $1.67 billion combined (8.3%)
* **Howard Hughes Holdings (HHH):** $1.39 billion

**New Holdings This Quarter**

* **Amazon (AMZN):** Undisclosed value but confirmed as a major new stake (included this since it was just announced)
* **Brookfield Corp (BN):** $2.15 billion
* **Hertz (HTZ):** 15 million shares, valued at $59.1 million

**Notable Portfolio Changes (vs Q4 2024)**

* **Uber (UBER):** New position, 30.3 million shares worth $2.21 billion
* **Brookfield (BN):** Added 6.1 million shares (+18%)
* **Alphabet (GOOG):** Trimmed by 1.2 million shares (-16%)
* **Chipotle (CMG):** Trimmed by 3.1 million shares (-13%)
* **Hilton (HLT):** Cut by 2.4 million shares (-45%)
* **Nike (NKE):** Fully exited, previously held $1.42 billion stake

**The Amazon Bet: ""A Margin Expansion Play""**

In a recent investor call, Pershing Square CIO Ryan Israel highlighted Amazon as the “most substantial move” of the quarter. Ackman’s team saw the recent dip driven by tariff fears under President Trump as a rare entry point into one of the world’s most valuable companies.

Ackman’s Amazon bet aligns with his activist style: targeting companies with strong fundamentals temporarily discounted by market overreaction.

**Strategic Exits and Trims**

To free up capital for Amazon, Pershing exited its long-held position in Canadian Pacific one of Ackman’s earlier activist wins. The move was described as “regretful,” but necessary for portfolio rebalancing.

In addition, the fund trimmed exposure to:

* Chipotle (CMG)
* Hilton Worldwide (HLT)
* Alphabet (GOOG)

With U.S. markets adjusting to tariff-related volatility and earnings surprises, Pershing appears positioned for long-term capital appreciation in sectors ranging from logistics and cloud to consumer tech and transportation.

Is time time to buy AMZN for long term?

1krn233_GOOGL,GOOGL,"18 years old, bought 248 shares of Amazon at $205 share price with all my savings. Good idea for next 10 years? Here's my analysis:","I have been saving my money since my first job at 14, and decided today that it is time to invest. I looked at the balance sheets, income statements, and financial ratios of numerous companies and felt Amazon was my best bet. 

I like their strategy of rapid growth and reinvesting in the company rather than paying dividends. Lately, they have been expanding into grocery and pharmacy at a rapid pace as well, which I think synergizes well with their logistics. 

The biggest reason, though, that I thought Amazon was my best option is because of AI/automation. More than any company, I think AI and automation will be beneficial to Amazon's bottom line, simply due to their mass scale and high revenue. Even a 5% decrease in cost of their 2024 annual expenses due to automation/AI will result in $15 billion in savings. 

Management has proven they can execute, and Kuiper also has high potential. While there is a risk with tariffs, I feel Amazon can handle them better than most retailers, which will ultimately result in it having a larger monopoly after other retailers fall (good in the long term). 

I know it's generally not advised to have only one stock in the portfolio and that investing in a global ETF or S&P 500 index are most recommended, but I don't see why I would want to buy worse companies than Amazon and paying a management expense ratio for the fund, even if it is tiny. 

Also I see a lot of people here recommending google all the time but just from personal experience, I've found I use it less and less often in favor of GPT. Also, I feel there are a lot of uncertainties regarding their antitrust trial. 

So just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on my purchase of amazon at $205 and holding for 10 years.",2025-05-21,0,105

1kcd5c6_AMZN,AMZN,Amazon's Project Kuiper (Q1 Earnings),"Did some research recently that I thought I would share heading into earnings. Amazon has expanded to much more than an ecommerce platform. That's becoming inreasingly clear with their massive investment in AWS, Prime, ADS, Zoox and more. Project Kuiper is one of the lesser talked about, but most exciting investment by Amazon. 

Project Kuiper is a global satellite network. The plan is to launch more than 3,200 low Earth orbit satellites to bring broadband internet to remote and underserved areas.

But this isn’t just about internet access. Kuiper also supports Amazon’s broader cloud strategy by improving the reach and resilience of AWS infrastructure.

Kuiper isn't worth hundreds of billions today in a DCF, but it could be some day.

Here’s what’s happening:

**Key updates:**

* Amazon launched its first two test satellites in late 2023
* Over 90 future launches have been booked across ULA, Arianespace, and Blue Origin
* Mass production is underway at a new 172,000 sq ft facility in Washington
* Customer terminals can deliver up to 400 Mbps with low latency
* AMZN recently launched its first batch of 27 operational satellites
* Customer facing service is expected to commence in late 2025

**Why it matters:**

* Kuiper gives Amazon a physical layer to support AWS, especially in places with limited connectivity
* This could expand AWS into new verticals like maritime, mining, defense, and rural infrastructure
* It also positions Amazon to compete more directly with Starlink, but with a stronger focus on enterprise and cloud integration

Really important, I think, to begin to consider Amazon as more than a premier Ecommerce player. They've never been afraid to reinvest and I think they may surprise a lot of people over the next few years, as they continue to enter and dominate new markets.

If anyone's interested in reading more feel free to check out the full write up I put together! AMZN is definitely an interesting opportunity trading at relative PE lows.

1kbobtg_AMZN,AMZN,Option Plays for AMZN Earnings and Beyond," 

Continuing this busy week of economic and earnings reports, one of the sexier ones to watch out for is from Amazon. TBH I am bearish of the market overall, but also from a chart perspective is still looks fairly constructive, so I will leave the call of whether we go up or down , to you…I will just present you with the best option strategy for both bullish and bearish scenarios.

First, for you bulls out there, who are looking to profit upon good news and a good reaction, looking to target a strike of 210. The best trade we found for this situation is a 200/220 Call Spread, expiring in June.



https://preview.redd.it/ea2u03yuq0ye1.png?width=3040&format=png&auto=webp&s=057156309d4a9e8fbe1ae46850ec65607a6d6ac2

The cost of this trade is on the higher end, historically speaking, but definitely still within the ideal range. I like call (BULL) spreads because it monetizes quickly, so even if your view is slightly longer term to capture the trend, you can get some decent return from an initial knee-jerk reaction too.

 

 

https://preview.redd.it/mb4c19owq0ye1.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79613080c1e08f990d75a4ccf4e2723bd0d8903

The value of the underlying equity, AMZN, is down from its February high, but still strong and poised to bounce back upwards (depending on the earnings report.)

The heatmap of the trade shows why we like it so much. It is immediately profitable, even far from expiration, on a positive move in the underlying. Additionally, it also shows the downside, and how risk is limited to the premium, thus protecting investors from potentially huge losses…you care capped, you know what your downside is.

On the bearish side, we found two different trades. The first is for investors looking to be in the money right away, as this one shows profits throughout the duration of the contract, beginning immediately, if the underlying(AMZN) decreases in value. This trade is a 160/145 Put Spread, expiring in June.



 

https://preview.redd.it/ffivjig2r0ye1.png?width=3028&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3f670f9de1c2973c8ad955273580be5bba5339

The cost of this trade is less than what it would have been for most of April, but historically slightly above average.



https://preview.redd.it/ynyx1dp3r0ye1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=f897a5c2a378044c4da5ed5b1865abb9d32fbc7a

The heatmap of this trade shows the immediate profitability upon a downward move in the underlying, while also showing the downside risk is limited only to the premium paid for the trade.

The next trade we found is a 160/150/140/130 Put Condor

https://preview.redd.it/kckcdb27r0ye1.png?width=3029&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a7fbf63063909e33a37f8219b0645e30f9f5858

The cost of this trade is cheaper than the previous one, but still offers strong potential value with very limited downside risk, which once again is only the premiums paid



 

https://preview.redd.it/mkcsb1n8r0ye1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ca39d0963736b6ad84efd884fb14980bebb4aac

The heatmap of this trade shows that it takes more time for an investor to reach ideal profit levels, but it still offers similar returns as the previous trade, while being much cheaper.

In conclusion, Amazon’s earnings report is highly anticipated and ripe for the start of a new trend, choose your direction and place your trade and hope the earnings news does the rest.

Amazon doesn’t want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump’s trade war.

So the e-commerce giant will soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product, according to a person familiar with the plan.

The shopping site will display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.

**Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: “AI will reinvent virtually every customer experience we know” – 2025 Shareholder Letter**

Just read through Andy Jassy’s latest shareholder letter and wow — Amazon is going all-in on AI. Jassy outlined a massive investment push into artificial intelligence, saying it’s critical to stay competitive and improve customer experience. They’re not just relying on Nvidia either — Amazon is building its own AI chips (Trainium2) and ramping up their data center infrastructure.

He draws a comparison to how AWS started — big, bold bets that took time but paid off. Now they're betting that AI will drive the next decade of value for both customers and shareholders.

Some other interesting highlights:

* Project Kuiper is still alive and kicking — Amazon wants to provide satellite internet globally.
* Delivery improvements are coming, especially in rural areas.
* No mention of tariffs or current macro risks though, which was surprising given all the recent market headlines.

What do you guys think? Is Amazon’s AI push smart and forward-looking, or are they spreading themselves too thin? And should investors worry that they’re glossing over economic headwinds?",2025-04-10,20,15

AWS is a behemoth at $ 108 Bn in 2024 sales, and still growing at 19%. That is still remarkable growth for a market leader with two other 800-pound Gorillas, Alphabet and Microsoft, chasing it. It generated operating profits of $39 Bn last year, a growth of 66% with an operating profit margin of 37%.

Amazon's advertising revenue last year was estimated at $56Bn and growing around 20% a year. This is also a high operating margin business, generating over 20% in operating profits.

While online domestic and international sales are a drag, growing slower in single digits, they're not significantly slower than Walmart’s sales growth and margins.

Amazon Prime has about 200Mn members and is another sustainable, sticky, and high-margin business, valued at close to $360Bn.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",2025-03-12,369,39

# Tesla Sets Sights on Waymo & Uber in California Ride-Hailing

Tesla is making a serious push into the ride-hailing business, filing for a transportation permit in California—a move that could see the EV maker take on Uber, Lyft, and Waymo in a market it’s been eyeing for years.

**Not Just Robotaxis… Yet**

The permit, filed with the California Public Utilities Commission, suggests Tesla plans to operate its own fleet of vehicles rather than allowing private owners to offer rides like Uber and Lyft. But the biggest surprise? Tesla’s application mentions driver’s license and drug testing coordination, signaling human drivers—at least for now.

Elon Musk has been hyping up driverless ride-hailing for years, with plans to launch a robotaxi fleet in Texas by Juneand California by year-end. But Tesla still lacks approval to operate fully autonomous vehicles in the state, making this move a stepping stone toward that long-promised future.

**A Desperate Play for Growth?**

Tesla’s EV sales are slipping, marking its first annual decline in over a decade. With growing competition and softening demand, Musk needs new revenue streams. Enter ride-hailing—an industry Uber and Lyft have dominated for years while Waymo steadily expands its robotaxi footprint in San Francisco.

Musk has said Tesla’s fleet will eventually go driverless, but until regulators approve that, expect Model 3s and Model Ys operating much like a traditional ride-share service.

**The Road Ahead:** Tesla’s path to autonomy looks clearer in Texas, where self-driving rules are less restrictive than in California. But for now, Tesla is starting small—testing the waters before jumping in with full autonomy.

Uber and Waymo aren’t standing still either—Waymo plans to launch autonomous rides on Uber’s platform in Austin and Atlanta later this year.

Tesla’s ambitions are clear, but its path is murky. The real question: Will Tesla’s ride-hailing push be a game-changer or just another Musk promise that takes years to materialize?

# Amazon Unveils Its First Quantum Computing Chip

Amazon just threw its hat into the quantum computing arms race, unveiling Ocelot, its first-ever quantum chip. The move puts AWS in direct competition with Google and Microsoft, both of whom have recently hyped their own quantum breakthroughs.

**Quantum: The Next Tech Battleground**

Quantum computing is the holy grail of computing—offering mind-blowing speed for tasks like drug discovery, encryption, and AI development. But there’s a catch: quantum computers are notoriously unstable. Even the tiniest heat fluctuation can throw calculations off.

Enter Ocelot. Amazon claims its ""cat qubit"" tech (yes, as in Schrödinger’s cat) could slash error-correction costs by up to 90%, making quantum systems way more reliable. If true, it’s a big deal—because right now, keeping a quantum system from collapsing is about as easy as carrying a house of cards through a wind tunnel.

**Hype vs. Reality**

Of course, no one’s running Fortnite on a quantum computer anytime soon. Even Amazon’s quantum hardware lead admits we’re a decade away (at best) from real-world use cases. Google, Microsoft, and now Amazon are all racing toward quantum supremacy, but for now, this is more about bragging rights than practical applications.

**Amazon’s Endgame**

Ocelot isn’t a commercial product—yet. But Amazon’s playbook is obvious: build the tech, perfect it, then roll it out as a premium AWS service. With Braket, its cloud-based quantum computing platform, already live, Amazon is positioning itself as the go-to provider when quantum computing finally hits the mainstream.

Bottom line? Quantum computing is still a moonshot, but Amazon just signaled it plans to be one of the first to plant a flag.

Not only did Amazon beat expectations across the board, but for the first time in over a decade, Amazon’s quarterly revenue has surpassed Walmart, making it the largest revenue-generating company in the U.S.

What’s Next?

Amazon is projected to spend over $104 billion in CapEx in 2025, primarily focusing on AI and cloud expansion. CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly emphasized how AWS is aggressively investing in infrastructure to meet surging demand.

With one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate history, Amazon is in a prime position to capitalize on AI, cloud dominance, and further logistics expansion.

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week’s final act? A crucial inflation gut check. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index—aka the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—drops today, and while Jerome Powell tried to sound optimistic in yesterday’s press conference, prices are still running hotter than he’d like. If today’s data shows inflation cooling, markets will start dreaming of rate cuts in March. If not, brace for more Fed-induced suspense.

Earnings season isn’t done yet, with a fresh batch of heavyweights reporting, including Colgate-Palmolive ($CL), Church & Dwight ($CHD), AbbVie ($ABBV), Phillips 66 ($PSX), and Eaton Corporation ($ETN). Expect Wall Street to comb through the numbers for any signs of consumer fatigue or corporate pricing power—because in this economy, margins matter more than ever.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Exxon Mobil** is stuck in neutral, but that might be just fine. The energy giant has eked out a 5% gain over the past year, underperforming broader markets but keeping its valuation attractive.

Consensus: $1.79 EPS, $88.23 billion in revenue. ($XOM)
* **Chevron** isn’t winning any speed races either, but slow and steady could pay off. The stock has only climbed single digits in the past year, but with a solid balance sheet, a juicy dividend, and a shift toward long-term investments beyond crude, it’s playing the long game. While lower oil prices may squeeze near-term profits, any shift away from clean energy policies could boost its prospects. Consensus: $2.40 EPS, $48.68 billion in revenue. ($CVX)",2025-01-31,24,1

1ia16sr_AMZN,AMZN,Is Amazon high PE ratio justified?,"Looking at AMZN's metrics from a value investing perspective, the high P/E is concerning. While AWS dominance and reinvestment in growth explain some premium, current valuation assumes everything goes perfectly. The market seems to be extrapolating past growth rates, which as you note, become mathematically challenging at their revenue scale.

The combination of high P/E, slowing growth potential, and thin retail margins suggests limited margin of safety at current prices.

1iamd89_AMZN,AMZN,Is Amazon overvalued? A deeper look,"AMZN’s price is pretty high. Is it worth it? Honestly, there's no simple answer. It's a massive company with its fingers in a lot of pies.

**The numbers: a quick check-up**

Several key numbers suggest Amazon might be a bit pricey:

* **P/E Ratio:** We're looking at a projected 43.9x (2024) and 36.4x (2025).
* **Price-to-Book Ratio:** Similar story here: 8.55x (2024) and 6.56x (2025).
* **EV/Sales:** This ratio, at 3.63x (2024) and 3.18x (2025). 

Numbers point towards a potentially overvalued stock, but it's not the whole story. There are other ways to look at it:  
\- **Intrinsic Value: $115.10 (indicating it's 49% overvalued at the moment)**  

**- Relative Value: $115.10**  

**- Peter Lynch Fair Value: $216.80**  

**- Ben Graham Fair Value: $334.10**  

**- Reverse DCF (Implied FCF Growth): 14.8%**  

**- EPV (% of EV): 29.8%**

So, based on intrinsic value alone, it seems that Amazon is ‘a bit’ overpriced right now. However, when we compare this to some other valuation methods (like Peter Lynch or Ben Graham’s approach), there’s a notable difference—suggesting that maybe Amazon still has room to grow.

**Strong growth and profits:**  
Despite the valuation debate, Amazon's financial health is undeniably strong:

* **Revenue Growth:** They're expecting a massive jump from $634.3 billion in 2024 to $707.3 billion in 2025. That's some serious growth.
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:** A projected 20.55% increase, from $5.15 to $6.20..
* **Net Margin:** Improving from 8.61% to 9.45%.

This strong performance certainly helps justify the high valuation, at least to some extent.  
  
**More than just online retail:**

Amazon's success isn't just about e-commerce. Its diverse businesses are key:

* **E-commerce:** While only about 15% of total retail sales, it's still a major growth driver.
* **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Projected to hit $100 billion in sales this year, but facing increasing competition.
* **Advertising:** A high-margin, fast-growing business segment.

This diversification provides a buffer against challenges in any single area.

**Potential risks:**

It's not all smooth sailing for Amazon:

* **Government Regulation:** Increased government scrutiny could really slow them down.
* **Economic Slowdown:** If the economy tanks, people will cut back on spending, hurting Amazon's sales.
* **Competition:** Companies like Microsoft and Google are serious competitors, especially in cloud computing. 

**Final thoughts:**

Despite some metrics suggesting overvaluation, Amazon's growth potential across various sectors, from e-commerce to cloud computing and advertising, paints a picture of a company with significant upside. Yet, it's not without risks, particularly from regulatory oversight and competitive pressures. The real question isn't just if Amazon is overvalued but whether its growth trajectory can justify the current price over time.

1i94nvc_AMZN,AMZN,Revisiting Amazon:  What Did We All Learn After Six Month,"# Framing:  Thinking about our habits

I think looking at failures and successes help us learn how to be better in the future.

# Case in point:  Our Discussion on Amazon

Six months ago, Amazon took a heavy hit, and I posted ""[Buy The Dip:  Amazon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1eifsuy/buy_the_amazon_dip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).""  At the time, there was a raging argument on ""should I buy Intel,"" and I posted this because it made no sense to me to buy Intel when you could buy Amazon on sale due to a minor miss on revenue.

While not strictly a value stock, I called out that AMZN had a forward PE in the 30s, which made no sense to me.  (I blend value metrics into a growth mindset.)

The Value-investing community basically jumped in and said, ""Yes, Amazon looks like it is on sale.""  Really, a strong feeling from the vast majority that Amazon was unfairly punished.

# Fast foward six months:

Amazon is up 40% since that robust discussion.  Unfortunately, even on a forward basis, the PE is somewhere around 45.  So, we may argue that Amazon stock may grow, but it is probably ""not on sale.""

Now if you were here, and you read the post:

1. Did you invest in what seemed to be an obvious story?
2. Did you read it and agree and not pull the trigger?

And would you share why you either bought or didn't buy.

# Oh, and one more thing:

While I like the details of value investing, I am a major fan of ""trying to get the big picture.""  Perplexity is pretty darn good at doing things that I that would be much slower under traditional fashions while thinking about this post.

I wanted to see Amazon's historical growth rate in the retail side only, no AWS, and then I wanted it to contrast to Walmart sales.  I have a theory about economies of scale and the size of Amazon's business.  Perplexity punched a graph out in a couple of minutes, which I find fascinating.

I don't believe this subreddit allows me to post the graph, but I can do a markdown table.  The growth of Amazon vs Walmart is really interesting.  Amazon is going to be over $1T in retail sales before we get to 2030.

1hykmnk_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN Leaps Opinions,"Got 11 15/08/2025 $170 calls for AMZN wanted to sell when It was at $233 mid DEC but held because I really didn't want to add another $40k CAD to my capital gains for the year (was already at $80k CAD) hoped it would hold around $230 going into the new year and sell on the second,  Still feeling pretty confidant in my play they are getting a lot of price target upgrades and AWS looks positioned to do very well, but as we all know the market can stay irrational longer than I can be solvent.  Should I sell now and change my exp date and strike price for further out?  I feel like I should wait for the earnings at the end of the month cause they are looking like they are going to be solid but the talk of tariffs and annexing canada and greenland and the like and how the stock market has already reacted to that have me worried that that will overshadow the good news of earnings anyways.

In the last month the negative sentiment from the FTC lawsuit was dragging down the stock which seemed to cancel out the benefit of a strong holiday shopping sesson. So I canceled my plan to buy $AMZN and bought other retailers, but am now regretting that decision. 

Today at the close of trading the stock is trading about $226 compared to $215 a week ago because they announced new drone deliveries directly to customers in Denver and a new Amazon Auto division that is in partnership with Hyundai. $AMZN is complicated to forecast on with all it's different business lines.

1h5wp2m_AMZN,AMZN,Should I Use Tax Loss Harvesting to Dilute My Amazon Holdings?,"Hello everyone,

My portfolio is currently split 50/50 between Amazon stock (from RSUs that vested over five years ago) and a mix of high-growth ETFs and total market ETFs. I’ve been considering reducing my position in Amazon, but I’ve been hesitant due to the 15% capital gains tax.

Earlier this year, I sold some losing positions in stocks I had held for over three years, resulting in a loss of around $100k. I’m now wondering if it’s a good idea to offset these losses with gains from selling some Amazon shares, leaving me with a net loss of $3k to claim on my 2024 taxes.

Since retirement is over 25 years away, my plan is to reinvest in high-growth ETFs like QQQ or VUG. While these ETFs still have a significant exposure to Amazon, they would provide more diversification than my current concentrated position.

Does this strategy make sense? Are there any other factors I should consider before proceeding? I’d appreciate your advice!",2024-12-03,13,10

1ggkv20_AMZN,AMZN,Here's why you should buy AMZN for earnings.,"Hi everyone. I used to work at AMZN (AWS specifically) as a Cloud Engineer - I was there for nearly 5 years. In my time there, I made lots of friends, many of whom I still keep in contact with today (this will be important later).

The stock was $153 at the beginning of the year, ran up to $200, collapsed back to $150 in the August 5 dump, and has had a hard time breaking $195 since. Today is a rough day in the market, but it's only one day - overall, the market is pumping in an upward trend due to the upcoming election. Additionally, the market is due for a melt up next year.

There's a lot of resistance at $200 for AMZN, but with the upcoming earnings today, along with the upward market trend toward the end of the year, once we break through $200, it'll keep carrying.

Now on to earnings: AMZN has lost a lot of high-paid employees over the past few months. Everyone knows about the RTO mandate that Jassy has implemented, and I've been hearing from multiple friends that people are leaving and looking for better opportunities elsewhere. **This is great for earnings**, as it shows that AMZN is cutting overhead costs for many of its departments, along with cutting several high-profile departments altogether. The AWS money machine continually grows, especially with the new services and tiers for each service it has been deploying - YoY growth is expected to increase. Additionally, the retail side of the company hasn't slowed down.

Last, but not least, I ordered something from AMZN and they said it was going to arrive in 2 days, but it arrived in 1.

My position: 200 shares @ $187.09 avg, hold through the election. After my 200 shares, I had enough for a few calls, so I bought a lotto ticket of 195C Exp 11/1, although the 11/8 Exp would probably be better.

4:10PM EDIT: The stock is up AH, but we need to break through $200. If we break through $200 AH, we should hold throughout the night and continue in an upward trend through tomorrow. If we do not break $200, we will be up but I'm not expecting a huge gain.

The actual earnings call will let us know where the stock is headed tomorrow.",2024-10-31,264,165

1gfhrdn_AMZN,AMZN,Collected several thousand AMZN shares over 5 years... should I be selling covered calls?,"Collected a few thousand AMZN shares over 5 years as part of my compensation. Someone asked me if I sell covered calls and I said I was too scared to try. Today I looked at the premiums for a 11/1 call and I could be making thousands each week by selling about 11%+ OTM. Seems like a no brainer considering AMZN doesn't have such big moves in general. Plus Bezos will just sell again at $200 like a few months ago.

I'm planning to travel next year for a while, meaning no regular income coming in and low tax bracket. Sounds like I should get a handle on selling covered calls and start raking in some cash money while abroad.

So, I’m stuck waiting on a train for 10 minutes tonight and I see something unusual. It is LOADED with ‘Prime’ shipping containers. I’ve never seen a train loaded with Amazon shipping containers. I confirmed with other people and they haven’t seen them either. Also, these containers appeared to be young/new.

Now, I know this isn’t like spotting Bigfoot or some shit. But, it’s gotta mean something. Either changes in routing for overseas cargo or maybe just using more trains and less semi-trucks to get your wife’s boyfriend’s shit to your house.

1fniwev_AMZN,AMZN,Nobody will read this title im gay AMZN,"AMZN call or put?

I am very excited for Amazons upcoming QE in October, but at the same time sceptical on which side should I play on. Call or Put?

Why I think call:
✅ UK’s Chancellor announces £8 billion Amazon Web Services investment
✅ Amazon announces record-breaking sales for 2024 Prime Day event which is and isn’t relevant for this upcoming QE since the Prime Day event was in July.
✅ AWS… need I say more

Why I think Puts:
❌ The last QE did relatively good on numbers, except for the expected growth for AWS which drove the stock down on the day after QE report
❌ Nothing in my due diligence stroke attention on exponential growth in AWS except for the UK’s investment which can still not overide the highly anticipated and demanded growth and pressure on AWS
❌ A Huge Rise in Amazon Sellers Fees making it unprofitable to sell for SOME sellers.

Now for the facts which I can’t even decide if it will or will not affect QE’s movement:
🎭 Employees coming back to office from working remotely??????????? People will either quit or productivity will increase. Most likely the first one since most of them are probably in some sort of exotic countries or Islands.
🎭 Skynopy Inks Partnership With Amazon AWS???? Now a Paris-based satellite connectivity startup linking up with Amazon. Can either end up like the recent GTA definitive edition or like citroen cars. In neither scenarios beneficial. 
🎭 White House teams up with Nvidia, Amazon on AI data centre strategy. Yeah ok and what if Biden loses will the other Telected Rpresident Uwill Mcontinue Pto team up? Or will this be money in the drain type of situation 

Just seen my student debt so might be speaking in Monkey but Im still for some reason expecting good results.

But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS.

❗️The Market Just Flipped the Script

For the last couple of years, we’ve been living in an upside-down world where bad economic news was actually good news for investors. The logic? If the economy looked rough, the Fed might ease up on those pesky interest rates. But now, we’re back in the real world—bad news is just…well, bad.

Let’s talk numbers: The latest employment data is out, and it's not pretty. Unemployment has crept up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Employers added a measly 114,000 jobs in July, a far cry from last year’s monthly average of 251,000. It’s like expecting fireworks and getting a sparkler.

But wait—there's a twist. Some experts are saying that the rise in unemployment is due to temporary layoffs, so this could just be a blip rather than the beginning of a downward spiral. Still, the S&P 500 ($SPY) didn’t take the news lightly, dropping around 2% in what might be the biggest market slump over jobs data in two years.

The Fed’s Tightrope Walk Just Got Trickier

If you’re scratching your head wondering why the market had a meltdown over a job report, here’s the tea: Investors are spooked that the Fed might have overdone it with the rate hikes. The delicate balance between cooling inflation and keeping the economy afloat is starting to look more like a juggling act with one too many balls.

Here’s where it gets juicy: Just yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. But with this latest job data, economists are now betting the Fed might have to slash rates even deeper than anticipated. Think of it as the Fed hitting the brakes a little too late, and now everyone’s bracing for a bumpy ride.

Despite the drama, analysts are urging investors to keep calm and carry on. Volatility might be making a comeback, but that’s par for the course as the Fed gets ready to shift gears.

In short, the market’s mood just did a 180, and we’re all buckled in for whatever comes next.

Earnings Olympics: Winners and Losers

This week’s earnings reports felt like a high-stakes competition, with some companies nailing their routines while others took a tumble. Let’s take a look at who’s bringing home the gold and who’s licking their wounds.

Intel’s Bad Day

Intel ($INTC) had a week so rough, it could use a hug. The chipmaker saw its stock nosedive by 26.06%—its worst single-day performance since the Nixon era—after missing earnings expectations left and right. Revenue fell short at $12.83 billion versus the anticipated $12.98 billion, and EPS was a jaw-dropping 80% lower than expected at just $0.02. To top it off, Intel announced a 15% workforce reduction, meaning 15,000 employees are getting the pink slip.

Apple Bites Back

On the flip side, Apple ($AAPL) kept the doctor away with some solid numbers. The tech giant reported $85.78 billion in revenue, outpacing expectations of $84.38 billion, and EPS hit $1.40, beating the $1.34 forecast. iPhone sales made up nearly half of Apple’s total revenue, but the real MVP was the iPad, with sales skyrocketing 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion.

Amazon’s Mixed Bag

Amazon ($AMZN) gave investors a rollercoaster ride, plunging 8.78% despite a mostly solid report. The company missed on revenue, pulling in $147.98 billion compared to the $148.76 billion expected, but managed to beat EPS estimates with $1.26 versus the anticipated $1.02. While its ad business grew 20%, it still didn’t meet the $13 billion sales target, clocking in at $12.8 billion.

Carvana’s Comeback

Carvana ($CVNA) was the comeback kid of the week, with shares surging after an earnings surprise. The online car dealer reported an EPS of $0.39, smashing the expected loss of -$0.12. Revenue also cruised past expectations at $3.41 billion, up 15% from last year. The cherry on top? Carvana sold 101,000 vehicles this quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year.



Microsoft’s AI Miss

Microsoft ($MSFT) had a mixed day, staying mostly on target but missing the mark on AI. The tech titan reported EPS of $2.95, barely above the expected $2.94, and revenue of $64.73 billion, edging out the $64.44 billion forecast. However, its “intelligence” cloud revenue, which includes its AI efforts, came in at $28.5 billion, just shy of the $28.7 billion target, leaving investors less than thrilled.

In the chaotic world of earnings, one slip can send stocks tumbling, while nailing the numbers keeps you in the winner's circle.



On The Horizon

What’s Coming Next Week:

After a rollercoaster of economic announcements, next week is shaping up to be a much-needed breather. We’ll get a few data points—July ISM services on Monday, June trade balance on Tuesday, and June consumer credit on Wednesday—but nothing that’s likely to shake the market’s foundation.

However, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims report is the one to watch. Given how this week’s job numbers rattled investors, these reports are becoming key indicators for where the market might head next.



Earnings to Watch:

With 70% of the S&P 500 having already spilled the tea on their quarterly earnings, and Big Tech mostly out of the way, you’d think we could relax. But no, there are still some big names reporting next week that you’ll want to keep an eye on:

Monday: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Hims & Hers Health ($HIMS), Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), The Carlyle Group ($CG)

Tuesday: Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

Wednesday: Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

Thursday: Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

Friday: Hawaiian Electric Industries ($HE), Getty Images ($GETY), Canopy Growth ($CGC), Soho House & Co. ($SHCO)

1eifsuy_AMZN,AMZN,Buy The Amazon Dip,"In counter to the ranging conversation on Intel, to me the obvious results from yesterday is buy the Amazon dip.

The street was looking for $148.8B revenue and they did $148.0B
However, earnings killed it.  They did $14.7 vs the street $13.6B

More than that, everybody was concerned that AWS wouldn't hit expectations after MSFT, and AWS did better.

The result?  Amazon falls 10%.

Very simply, Amazon is now trading in the 30s for a PE, which is clearly under their historical mean.  To suggest that this stock price makes sense, you need to argue the following:

* Amazon has systemic issues
* Amazon retail deserves a LOWER multiple that Walmart on EPS
* The Cloud market is going to crater, and deserves a multiple the same as retail

Now, when you have an event like this, you get a bunch of headlines that try to give a reason for the dip.  Some cite that the current quarter outlook wasn't as strong as what the street wanted.  However, this is often the case at Amazon.  Some cite that the revenues disappointed, but this really is fx, which should be a reasonable reason beyond Amazon's control.

However, this is not what I see.  Amazon delivers exceptionally well.  They continue to put pressure on all normal retail stores.  I only find myself buy more and more on Amazon, not less and less.  More people are buying online, and Amazon is still slowly gaining share.

So what do you have left?  Basically, the street wanted to see their internal advertising growth 24% year or year.  It ""only"" grew 20%.

To me, this is Mr Market missing the boat, and if you are wiling to do a sum of the parts and compare Amazon to their peers, this is a buying opp.",2024-08-02,317,109

Amazon Couldn't Deliver — Cloud Gains, Retail Pains

Amazon’s second-quarter earnings report has landed, and it's clear that even the mighty e-commerce giant isn’t immune to cautious consumer spending. The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.
iPads Shine, iPhones Stumble

Apple’s ($AAPL) bread and butter, the iPhone, which still accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales, saw a slight revenue decline year-over-year to $39.3 billion. While this was better than the $38.81 billion analysts expected, it's still a 1% drop, marking a slowdown in what’s usually Apple’s star performer.
But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.
Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

After Market Close:

AMC Entertainment Holdings ($AMC) might be a favorite among meme stock enthusiasts, but beneath the surface, the picture isn’t as rosy. The company is grappling with high debt, falling revenue, and ongoing unprofitability, which has led analysts to universally avoid recommending the stock. However, in the unpredictable world of meme stocks, all it takes is a few viral posts on Reddit for AMC to surge. Consensus estimates are -$0.47 EPS on $1.04 billion in revenue.

1eifsuy_MSFT,MSFT,Buy The Amazon Dip,"In counter to the ranging conversation on Intel, to me the obvious results from yesterday is buy the Amazon dip.

The street was looking for $148.8B revenue and they did $148.0B
However, earnings killed it.  They did $14.7 vs the street $13.6B

More than that, everybody was concerned that AWS wouldn't hit expectations after MSFT, and AWS did better.

The result?  Amazon falls 10%.

Very simply, Amazon is now trading in the 30s for a PE, which is clearly under their historical mean.  To suggest that this stock price makes sense, you need to argue the following:

* Amazon has systemic issues
* Amazon retail deserves a LOWER multiple that Walmart on EPS
* The Cloud market is going to crater, and deserves a multiple the same as retail

Now, when you have an event like this, you get a bunch of headlines that try to give a reason for the dip.  Some cite that the current quarter outlook wasn't as strong as what the street wanted.  However, this is often the case at Amazon.  Some cite that the revenues disappointed, but this really is fx, which should be a reasonable reason beyond Amazon's control.

However, this is not what I see.  Amazon delivers exceptionally well.  They continue to put pressure on all normal retail stores.  I only find myself buy more and more on Amazon, not less and less.  More people are buying online, and Amazon is still slowly gaining share.

So what do you have left?  Basically, the street wanted to see their internal advertising growth 24% year or year.  It ""only"" grew 20%.

To me, this is Mr Market missing the boat, and if you are wiling to do a sum of the parts and compare Amazon to their peers, this is a buying opp.",2024-08-02,315,109

1ehnoi0_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight,"Earnings from [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year.



[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges.



Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year.



Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion.



Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program.



Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope.



Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations.



The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales.



Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",2024-08-01,2,3

Also I am thinking of doing a study channel or AMA for people who want to ask questions about option trading (I have been doing this professionally since 1986) but if you regards are interested in that then DM me, if there is interest then I will do it....

So in this busy week of earnings (there will be a couple more of these this week) lets look at Amazon for later today.



[failed through the trendline but making an effort to comeback](https://preview.redd.it/os3agnvf0nxc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a54c4b750f3aa053926a1916d40b44f32325373)

I am going to be giving this around 50 days to run its course, for the upside I am going to target around $200 based on us challenging the previous high and then around $165 for for the downside, that will be around the 38.2% fib retracement from the rally that began back last year.



https://preview.redd.it/ctpnp8zj0nxc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e9ddebc501a5980956817bdf92e88dfe01692f

Using the June expiration to make my plays and looking at the top of BB1’s list

If you can get in on this around 75 cents (which will work out to about 90cents when you factor in costs), it is a good punt to the upside.



https://preview.redd.it/ylw4ol8o0nxc1.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=06218d277de68693d19378e42b87d291990eb3f0

You can make a little on an initial jump but it will really start to kick in next month if we grind higher

For the downside I am targeting $160 but giving myself some wiggle room as I want to make sure that I have a reasonable shot at this.



https://preview.redd.it/g76mep6p0nxc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6f1b62139c7681d0385d3f05beacfb3f7714849

Now , I am going to pick the one 4th on the list for this, purely because it is less outlay, even though BB1 accounts for that in the returns, it is just a personal choice. BB1 bases everything on the amount invested ($1000) so technically I should just do what it says, but the trade scores are very close so it really shouldn’t make much difference

https://preview.redd.it/otowuzlu2nxc1.png?width=2089&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c92c1c2494fffc5f13b2e39b8a8f7910eaca24

This one monetizes quick on the downmove so quite like this for a downside trade and at $1 I know what my max loss is.



https://preview.redd.it/1ktzh2dt0nxc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f790e8b35501515cb76a4d350f20e900b9772e5f

Looking for an $11 move out of this number as compared to a regular $7 range…

So there you have it, you like the downside the 147.50/157.50/167.50 put fly at around $1 and for the bullish players out there, the 192.50/200/207.50 call fly for around 75 cents

1b8a3n8_AMZN,AMZN,The downfall of Amazon $AMZN has started.,"Investors and consumers need to know this very important fact about Amazon (Marketplace). They just dug their own grave. Third party sellers make up about 65% of the sales generated on Amazon and recently they did a dirty move to third sellers that will have many leaving the platform or raising prices so high that Amazon becomes uncompetitive to consumers. Amazon just announced/implemented two new double-dip fees that will crush third party sellers and that's not even an exaggeration.

The first fee which has been implemented already is an ""inbound placement fee"" which is a shipping fee Amazon tacks on to send inventory to Amazon ""Prime"" for Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This fee has increased the shipping cost for third party sellers by 6-10x. For example, a seller sending a truckload of inventory (prior to this inbound placement fee) to Amazon traditionally spent about $600-$800, sometimes way more. Now on top of this they are charged with the inbound placement fee of about $3,000-$5,000. This essentially wipes out a huge chunk, if not most, of the profit margin for a seller on Amazon. Add in the additional fees Amazon charges: 15% referral fee (just to list on their site), 8-15% fulfillment fee (FBA; picking, packing and delivery), storage fees (around $0.78 per cubic foot) and advertising costs (about 2-15% of the price of each good depending on the market).

The second fee which will take place in about a month is a ""low inventory fee"" which is a fee imposed by the Amazon algorithm when inventory is starting to run low at Amazon fulfillment centers. This fee can be anywhere from $0.32-$1.11 PER ITEM. The kicker is that the Amazon fulfillment center receiving process is a huge cluster fuck that can take 30+ days to inbound and check-in from when the Seller ships it. That is, if Amazon doesn't lose or damage the goods at the warehouse OR during delivery.

So by the time Amazon ships a product out to a customer, they have essentially pocketed about 60% of the sale. When you take out the cost of the good for the seller, that leaves them with very little profit margin, if any. The margins were already razor thin before these rate hikes and now they are all but gone.

Why is this important to investors and customers? The only solution for third party sellers to barely keep their head above the water and maintain a remote semblance of their razor thin margins prior to the new fees is to raise prices. I'm talking 20-30% price increases are required at a minimum just to get back to par. You want to talk about all the issues with inflation well, now you know, corporate greed is being shown at its finest. Amazon reported a $30.4 billion net income for 2023 but will penny pinch third party sellers even more at the expense of driving prices up for consumers like never before seen on the platform. This will cause consumers to look elsewhere to shop other than Amazon because Amazon will now be highly uncompetitive. It's just a matter of time. Amazon shot themselves in the foot and needs to reverse course on these absurd fees.

PUTS ON $AMZN

[ADD] Wow this post blew up! While I have your attention, remember when you get a damaged or wrong product from Amazon, don’t go leaving a 1-star negative review because that just screws over the seller who had nothing to do with the transaction. It’s 100% Amazon’s fault and leaving a negative review is a shit thing to do. Contact customer service instead and yell at them. On that note, if a seller reaches out and makes things right, leave a good review or edit the bad review you left. The good Sellers work hard for their reviews and you shouldn’t shit on them for Amazon’s mistakes.",2024-03-06,4045,1652

As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.

Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:

**Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:**\- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.

\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.

""**Voluntary"" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:**\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.

\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.

**Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:**

\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.

\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.

This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.

\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.

\*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.

Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.

Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.

Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.

Position: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.

I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**",2024-01-19,175,137

|Price to Owner Earnings|121!|25-45|
|ROIC|7%|20-30%|
|FCF yield|1% (or negative)|2-4%|

P/S ratio is good at 2.5 compared to 7-12 for the others, which I grant is excellent in comparison and makes sense for a retailer. My main issue is that they don't seem to be allocating capital as well for growth as before.

WMT by comparison (which should be losing to AMZN in retail) has P/S of 0.5, FCF yield of >4% and double digit ROIC for most of the past 10 years, at 9.7% this year.

Last quarterly, AMZN reported the first positive TTM FCF since it went negative 3 years ago.

Cloud revenue is growing 12% but operating income is barely up, marketshare is stable at 32% while MSFT's is growing 2% per year, now around 23%. The story here seems to be that their CapEx is maintaining marketshare and nothing more. They have generative AI offerings but MSFT's partnership with OpenAI gives them an edge there, so I don't think theres any reason to think AWS would be an obvious front-runner in this race.

Retail is the main silver lining with revenue and marketshare continuing to grow and return to profitability.

Based on the last earnings call I expect the next quarter to look good because of lumpy AWS deals and everyone being so bullish because of the fed guidance on rates. But going into Q2 with similar (or likely higher pricing) will be scary.

Their price is predicated on big long-term growth in revenue, FCF, sustained >20% ROIC, even then it's more expensive than the others by comparison. One explanation is that retail is huge, and they've nowhere near saturated the market, so they have more space to grow than say GOOGL, META in advertising. But the years of negative FCF followed by sub-par ROIC doesn't look good.

I think it's expected that a new CEO may start burning FCF to fund new initiatives, but 3 years is a long time to not see any visible returns on that investment. The market is pricing them as if it's a done deal that they are coming out of this with >20% ROIC and 3-5x FCF.

This is also completely ignoring how their cost of capital is >10%, making their 7% ROIC this past TTM is effectively negative.

Looking at 17k loss.,"Last year I bought Amzn at $97, did a 600 AMZN 09/15/2023 100.00 C expecting it to be optioned when Amazon went to $100 it didn't sell. Not when Amzn went above $100, not at 115, not  at any time.
 
I finally figured out the option apparently went to a European market which only allowed the option to be exercised on the last day. I didn't even understand that was possible.

Now, I'm looking at the option coming due, at $100 when the stock is selling at $142.

I'm thinking of just rolling it out again, but how do I ensure it will be sold again on the European market instead of it being exercised here in the American market? I might just bite the bullet, accept the loss, and keep what make to carry on.
 
Any other ideas would be appreciated.",2023-09-12,1,31

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.",2023-07-26,801,180

Is there truly any real risk here to allow AMZN to make this purchase? Opposite from the ATVI the CMA in the UK has already approved it where the CMA is the final approval MSFT is awaiting on ATVI. 

I’m personally thinking the ATVI approval increases the chances that iRobot is approved but would be curious on others opinions?

131qp9l_AMZN,AMZN,$AMZN Q1 earnings review,,2023-04-28,65,20
1310clx_AMZN,AMZN,Your lotto play for AMZN's earnings tonight,"So yesterday I told everyone to buy [META calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) before earnings and it was a straight banger with the stock up 15% after earnings. The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.

I expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.

Trefis estimates Amazon’s valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110. 

**Revenues expected to top the estimates**

[Amazon’s revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.

* The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1.
* The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1.
* Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.

The estimates follow that Amazon’s fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.

**EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**

Amazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.

We expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.

**Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**

Remember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.

**What do other Finance Websites Say?**

[TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.

[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%. 

[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger. 

For those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.

**Amazon Earnings Expected Move**

Take a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN’s stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle’s expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.

AMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*

**What to do for today's Earnings**

Given all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way.

12twk1z_AMZN,AMZN,$AMZN vs. $SHOP: Which e-commerce stock is better?,"## Amazon ($AMZN)

After eight years of profitability, Amazon lost money in 2022, weighed down by investments like its 20% stake in the EV maker Rivian, whose value plunged in 2022. Between the punishment doled out by investors over the last year or so and its soaring valuation during the pandemic, there’s a lot of noise affecting Amazon shares. After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.

To deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths aren’t invincible.

However, when we look more closely at Amazon’s valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out. On the one hand, growth and momentum investors have been in love with the e-commerce giant for years, especially during the pandemic, when online shopping received a major push forward.

On the other hand, value investors would argue that Amazon has spent much of its publicly-traded life overvalued. The good news is that the company looks undervalued on some measures. For instance, it’s currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 2.0 versus its mean P/S of about 3.6 over the last five years.

Also, Amazon’s stock and valuation have come down a lot since the pandemic, when it traded at a P/S ratio of 5.0 and above. Additionally, it’s trading slightly above its pre-pandemic stock price but below its pre-pandemic P/S of about 4.0 to 4.5, also suggesting a long-term bullish view.

## What is the Price Target for AMZN Stock? 

Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $135.88, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of about 30%.

## Shopify ($SHOP)

A review of Shopify’s stock price action reveals similarities with Amazon’s. However, there is a critical difference between them. Although Shopify did manage to turn a profit in 2020 and 2021, probably due to the pandemic, it became far more unprofitable in 2022 than it was before the pandemic. Overall, SHOP’s fundamentals and valuation suggest a bearish view might be appropriate.

Like Amazon, Shopify was pummeled by its investments in 2022. For example, it took a massive $1 billion non-cash loss in the second quarter alone as a write-down of its equity investments, accounting for nearly all of that quarter’s loss. Unfortunately, the investment-related losses may be masking a larger issue.

Shopify’s research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses soared to $1.5 billion (about 43% higher year-over-year) and $1.73 billion (30% growth), respectively, in 2022. However, its gross profit only rose 11% from 2021, while its revenues grew only 21.4%.

Finally, although its valuation has plummeted, Shopify still looks grossly overvalued at a P/S ratio of 12.3, relative to the stronger, larger Amazon. Shopify’s mean P/S over the last five years is 31.1, but that just shows that it’s been overvalued for years.

## What is the Price Target for SHOP Stock?

Shopify has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 18 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $49.44, the average Shopify stock price target implies upside potential of 1.6%.

## Conclusion: Long-Term Bullish on $AMZN, Bearish on$ SHOP

Investor sentiment has long played a significant role in Amazon’s and Shopify’s valuations. However, it looks like investors have valued Shopify as if it’s the next Amazon rather than based on its own fundamentals. Thus, Amazon looks like the clear winner.

Unfortunately, Amazon may have a challenging time in the stock market in the near term due to the possibility of a recession, but the company has staying power and should eventually come roaring back. The key caveat is that a better entry price might materialize, but even at current levels, Amazon looks undervalued when factoring in its long-term potential and historical valuation.",2023-04-21,10,11

1066j8f_AMZN,AMZN,Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice,"# HISTORY:

The story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN’s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would’ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn’t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.

Tl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.

# INTRODUCTION:

AMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.

1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.
2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.
3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.
4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.
5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.
6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.

# REVENUE:

**AMZN store**:  
2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand."" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.

Past 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  ""more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery."" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.

AMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**AWS:**  
2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost"" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth ""more in the mid 20% growth rate"". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.

AWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions ""launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific."" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**3P:**  
I was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.

Of course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.

So throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.

&#x200B;

**Subscription:**  
Subscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, ""Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service"", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).

Subscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.

So throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  


**Advertising:**  
2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.

I won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.

Regardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).

I wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  


# EBIT:

As per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, ""drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal."" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.

AMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.

But, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.
2. D&A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.
3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.
4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%
5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   
positive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.
6. TGR taken to be 2%.
7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.

# QUESTIONS & NOTES:

1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  
As per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, ""40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally."" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.
2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  
AMZN’s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.
3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  
Data available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.
4. **How much AMZN’s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.
5. **LASTLY,**   
All my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. 

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like ""Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?"" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   
I see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.

For the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!

**$AMZN**

The stock opened with a small gap down, my first idea was to take the stock from a resistance level created in the last few days at $94 together with the descending trend line with a target at $92.3.

The trade was unsuccessful, and the stock took me out with a stop after twenty seconds of my entry.

I knew it was not the right timing and my idea was still valid so I continued to follow the stock, after a few minutes the stock stopped at the $95 resistance level and continued to fall to $94, broke the level, and consolidated below it, I entered orders:

Entry: $94

Stop loss - $94.37

Take Profit Point - $93.27 (2:1 RRR) I identified a level after the losing trade from the pre-market and that is why $92.3 was not the take profit point.

The Federal Trade Commission’s officials traded stocks and funds more than those at any other major agency, including going heavily into tech shares, The Wall Street Journal found

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

## In the News

Last week I looked at how high vol was in the FAANG+ names and detailed some Iron Condors in Amazon. AMZN stock closed last week about where it ended the week before, however, overall market IV was higher. So a scorecard on high IV neutral trades would look like this so far. Stock not moving: yes, IV going lower: no.

Most of these names begin to report in late October with some reporting before Oct 21st expiry, like TSLA, and others after, like AMZN and GOOGL. With that in mind, and with IV even higher let’s look at another high IV strategy for those that may be looking to turn bullish in a stock. We’ll use GOOGL, as an example, using Oct 21st expiry, as earnings don’t come into play until the week after. And we’ll compare two credit put spreads, one at the money, the other out of the money:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lj9t0zoejer91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe2ac758c23c94bad4a83411afa6174485e531c

https://preview.redd.it/sqs7itrfjer91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=da22cbc31d24db489f667c11d13290ed83f5482b

The first put spread sells the at the money put and buys the expected move put, risking 3, to make 2, if GOOGL is above $94 on Oct 21st. With the way stocks are whipping around this type of trade can be thought of as a fairly straightforward bullish play, with a little but of wiggle room below where the stock is trading (but not much). The more important factor is with IV this high, this trade doesn’t need a big snapback rally. It just needs a small one, or even one that starts from lower and just gets back to this point in the stock. In other words it doesn’t necessarily need to have its timing exactly right, nor its magnitude of move exactly right. Playing for a reversal with calls or debit call spreads kind of needs to have those things perfect at this point, with IV so high.

The second trade is an out-of-the-money put spread, risking about 75 to make 25 with its strikes set at the expected move. This is the type of trade someone does when they just think IV is beginning to overprice downside risk, and often at levels where they’d psychologically be a buyer of the stock. The advantage with a credit put spread vs a cash-secured put is that if the market crashes, it’s just a $75 loss rather than unlimited risk below.

GOOGL is simply an example here. There are a ton of similar stocks with similarly high IV at the moment. Eventually, there will be a snapback rally where calls work, but until then it’s interesting to look at some credit spreads and the defined risk associated with selling moves rather than trying to time them for a reversal.

I wish I could live the easy boglehead life of “VTSAX and chill,” but I am overconcentrated in this one stock against my will, so I need to manually pick stocks and ETFs that diversify/hedge against AMZN performance.

Current allocation:
-	VTI: 30% (which I know includes a lot of AMZN, tech, and consumer discressionary)
-	VXUS: 20% 
-	**Remaining 50%**: Split roughly evenly between A, AEP, BRK.B, CLX, GD, HAL, HCA, JNJ, KO, LMT, MMM, MO, PG, PWR, TMO, TXN, UGI, UNH, VAW, VZ, XLF, XOM

I’m mostly just buying S&P500 stocks in industries that are NOT tech and NOT consumer discressionary. But picking stocks is hard. What market am I missing? How can I better counter-balance against a large AMZN holding? I believe AMZN is a good investment… but I’m an engineer, not a day trader, and I really only need to do as well as the rest of the market.

Other notes:
-	No, I can’t buy AMZN puts. Company policy. And I’m not going to short QQQ. Stop. I’m looking for basic diversification help. 
-	I own a house, so I’m staying away from REITs and housing market-sensitive stocks. I’m overinvested in real estate too.
-	**I would love to hear about tech stocks and consumer discressionary stocks that don’t follow the price AMZN**. This is the most difficult place for me to invest. I own some TXN because IoT is the future and a little SHAK because hamburgers are delicious, but not much. I keep these bets small. I wish I could find something profitable and anti-cyclical with AMZN in these sectors. 
-	This is a problem with my taxable accounts. My IRA/401k accounts are low-expense target date funds, and I don’t think I need to change them.
-	I buy the max amount of I-bonds and I don’t need any more bonds in my taxable accounts.

wb2t4q_AMZN,AMZN,"Solo Brands $DTC has great potential to run up into earnings and beyond. After $AMZN beat earnings expectations and rallied 13% afterwards, we have a great indicator for other Consumer Discretionary stocks and overall consumer spending.","# Hi there,

the last couple of months I focussed heavily on two diffrent stocks, which both have the potential for great gains around earnings. Solo Brands $DTC is a consumer discretionary stock, which sells Leisure/outdoor products mostly online. The company IPO\`d last October at a really bad point in time and subsequently dropped from 23.42$, a little overvalued, down to 3.66$, extremly undervalued. 

The recent earnings report of $AMZN clearly showed, that the economic outlook is far better then expected. (Allthough still not super great, tbh) 

https://preview.redd.it/5n52275iqhe91.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=f55ca3429dcfaf7cadd05630160f4bb9053f85d0

After a 6 months downward trend line, $DTC formed a nice Wykoff Accumulation pattern and made a nice break out yesterday day, above the 4.74$ resistance. This is a strong technical sign and further share price pull backs should be met with increased demand, the 4.74$ resistance which held for 2 months will now act as a great point of resistance. A breakout above 5.50$ would trigger a big run up of $DTC, because its heavily shorted.

$DTC was sold short for months, because it went from profitable to unprofitable, but at a closer look, this happened due to 3 acquisitions $DTC made, which lead to over $100M implied costs recently. With those big One Time costs out of the way, $DTC has a much greater outlook, then back in oct. when it was at 21$, analysts expect $550M in revenue and $70M in earnings. With a current Market Cap. of $450M $DTC is pretty undervalued compared to the Leisure/Outdoor industry.

Based on the Price-to-Earnings Price-to-Sales and Price-to-Earnings-Growths $DTC\`s fair value lies at 2x-3x of the current share price of 4.88$, with the great technical outlook a decent earning on Aug. 11th could trigger a great run up of $DTC. There are 3.14M shares sold short atm and the float dropped substantially due to institutional holdings. This means, that only few shares are traded on the free market and any attempt to cover those short positions will lead to an exorbitant increase in share price.

According to Ortex around 300k shares were bought back by short sellers yesterday and the stock price rose by 12.41%, allthough those numbers are surely not 100% accurate it shows the potential, which lies in $DTC. Short sellers need to close their positions in order to make money and the longer they wait the further their profits melt, so they are in a time crunch, right before a great earnings run up can be expected. This leads to an explosive combination, which can be exploited by retail sellers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ywqe2slvvhe91.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=1743474b08f6f4deeaa0b4a555ac85f9959819aa

If we take a look at the graph, we can see, that while the share price was mostly stable and/or went slightly upwards, the short interest steadily increased, this is the best possible development. It shows, short sellers tried to suffocate the share price, but failed, even better all those shorted shares have to be bought back, too at some point.  

$DTC has very low avr. daily Volume around 600k, because of that it has a high number of ""Days-to-Cover"". Essentially this means, that its not possible to close out a significant number of Shorted shares, without heavily increasing the share price.

The good thing is, in contrast to most short squeeze plays, $DTC is a great company on its own, they are profitable, highly undervalued, innovative and dont need to dilute the share pool, which is a big risk factor in most squeeze plays.

The truth in my opinion is, that short seller simply miscalculated $DTC\`s business model and scalability. I have to admit, selling camping stoves, Bondfires, shorts and kayaks at first doesnt sound overwhelming, but according to market polls there is a great following of dedicated costumers, who stick to Solo Brands and their innovations and $DTC beat their last two quarterly earnings. 

Another great indicator is the amount of insider buying, during Q2 at the end of May the CFO and CEO bought over 130k shares of their company, which suggests they were satisfied with the numbers they saw.

For anyone interested in this play, there should be another dip before earnings at Aug. 11th, but if we see the share price breaching 5.50$ there is almost no resistance until 7.50$.

 July 21 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc [**(AMZN.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O) on Thursday agreed to buy primary care provider One Medical [**(ONEM.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ONEM.O) for $3.49 billion, expanding the e-commerce giant's virtual care presence and adding some brick-and-mortar doctors' offices to its healthcare arsenal.

The all-cash deal heralds a dramatic expansion of Amazon's healthcare ambitions, having piloted virtual care visits for Amazon employees in Seattle in 2019 before offering such services to other employers and in other cities under the Amazon Care brand.

 It also bought online pharmacy Pill Pack in 2018 and has partnered with Teladoc Health [**(TDOC.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TDOC.N) to help connect with doctors virtually through Alexa.

""We think healthcare is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention,"" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services.

In One Medical, Amazon will acquire a company with customers such as Airbnb Inc [**(ABNB.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABNB.O) and Alphabet Inc's [**(GOOGL.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O) Google.",2022-07-21,899,309

**Note about my day trading strategy:** I only trade 3 patterns (and their variations): pullbacks, consolidation breakouts, and climactic reversals. I follow trending stocks using the following timeframes:  
\-Patterns and setups identified off the 5-min  
\-The 2-min is used to fine tune entries  
\-The 15-min for multiple timeframe alignment (MTFA)  
\-Hourly and daily for bias and support/resistance areas  
\-General trade management: exit in halves or all-or-nothing (AON) towards target

Services (which includes AWS, advertisement, Prime Video and other) are far more profitable in the long run and are all growing at double digits Y/Y. AWS alone is still growing at 37% Y/Y, with a gross margin of 35%, compared to a loss for physical product sales.

At the current trend of growth, AWS sales will be half of online product sales by 2026 (or, if product sales completely stagnate and AWS continues the current growth, then AWS will be the largest source of income by 2026).

tdamk6_AMZN,AMZN,Amazon's Stock Split Explained [$AMZN]," **Amazon's Stock Split Explained \[for any new investors, or investors of $AMZN\]:**

&#x200B;

* Amazon is the latest tech giant to announce a stock split, following Apple, Tesla, and Google.
* This is Amazon's first stock split in over 20 years, and historically, stock split announcements have often triggered short-term rallies
* Amazon's 20-for-1 stock split means that you’ll receive 20 shares for each share you currently own
* Today, one share of Amazon stock is about $3,000, which means, the price would drop to around $150 per share
* Mathematically, stock splits don't create any ""new value"" for owners, or fundamentally change anything about a company. Stock Splits are a marketing maneuver, aimed at making a high-priced stocks more attractive to retail investors, who might consider buying it. Stock splits also make options contracts more affordable for retail investors.
* My prediction is that Amazon will also be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, which brought it from over $600 a share, to less than $100 per share, and it joined the Dow in 2015.
* Adding high-priced shares to the Dow is problematic because the index is price weighted, meaning the same percentage move matters more for a high priced stock than a low priced one.
* This is Amazon's first stock split since 1999, and the fourth since Amazon’s IPO in 1997. Amazon did a 2-for-1 split on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 split on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 split on Sept. 2, 1999.
* Amazon shares are up over 4,300% since the last split was announced.
* Google announced a 20-for-one split in February, Apple announced a 4-for-1 split in August 2020, Tesla announced a 5-to-1 split on August 2020 (Nvidia announced a 4-to-1 split in July 2021.)
* AMZN will begin trading at its new split-adjusted price on Monday, June 6, 2022.",2022-03-13,206,79

sjvmmh_AMZN,AMZN,"Amazon stock soars 15% after earnings, will hike Prime membership fee","Article link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-earnings-162246834.html

$AMZN is currently up 18% in AH.

Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter results on Thursday and announced it will raise its Prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119 in the U.S. The stock is soaring in after-hours.

These are the top- and bottom-line results for Amazon's fourth quarter.

Earnings per share: $27.75

Revenue: $137.4 billion

This is the third time since the launch of Amazon Prime that the e-commerce giant raises prices for its yearly delivery service in the U.S. It hiked fees in 2014 and 2018 by $20 each time. The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.

The company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.

""Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,"" said the company's earnings statement.

Net sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.

Amazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.

The company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.

“As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic,"" ""Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO said in the company's earnings release.

Disclosure: I have long positions in $AMZN.

What's very noteworthy is that they also booked an **$11.8B pre-tax gain from their stake in Rivian**: https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/, which accounted for more than *80%* of their quarterly profit",2022-02-03,1763,494
sjowri_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN earnings call is free money,"Alright you fucking ****** here’s a play thats so obvious and easy you’re gonna be wondering how you couldn’t see what I see.


So Zuck just got cucked on his shitty platform and even shittier Metaverse transition. That combined with paypal, spotify, and some other tech heavy less than stellar reports have broken the rally that’s happening this week. The market was wayy wayy wayy oversold and is simply retracing its gains back this week. But guess what stock didn’t really share in the retracement?

AMZN broke out of its comfy 3000-3600 trading range that its been sitting in for the last two years, during the January correction. It bottomed at 2800 before correcting in the last 5 sessions back to 3000. Then after hours yesterday the stock dropped 200 back to 2800 purely off of investors fears that tech is getting clobbered in their earnings reports.

This is a huge opportunity. All AMZN has to do is post an OKish earnings report and this thing will pop to 3k tomorrow. God forbid it actually posts some good earnings which it easily could do. Long story short this is a great entry point for AMZN. You can chose how you want to play it. I only do options cause I’m not a pussy.

sjreb1_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN Could Fly On Earnings,"This is why I'm betting AMZN does well on earnings today AH! 

For starters, AMZN is down 6.85% at the time of writing this today, meaning, the market is already scared with what happened to (FB, NFLX, PYPL, etc...) and many investors are getting out in an effort to protect themselves if AMZN blows earnings. So, a bad earnings could be partially priced in with this decline. 

Second, AMZN blew earnings last quarter (Q3 '21) when they had a 59.4% decline in Net Income forcing a small sell off back in Oct of last year.  Now, their expectations are 50% lower than they were in Q4 of '20 ($7 EPS vs. $3.67 EPS for this quarter) so much of their slower growth/high transport cost has been priced in. 

Third, their stock is already down nearly 26% from its November high, so the likelihood of another massive correction like we saw with FB/NFLX is unlikely since investors have already sold off.  While, there is always room to go down more, if AMZN offers any kind of positive guidance, I believe the stock will do very well! 

tl;dr

While this is still a risky play since investors have not been kind to slowing growth of these companies, AMZN has done a lot of bleeding already, their EPS estimates are in the trash, and everyone is already fearful of whats to come. Could be the high-risk semi-smart play that works out!",2022-02-03,96,76

saadhf_MSFT,MSFT,"A Little Analysis on Big Tech (GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN)","In this post I'm going to look at Big Tech.  The earnings multiples, the growth, the market cap, and whether we're getting in at good prices now, or if we should wait for further downside.  I'll look at each of the tech companies valued over $1T (Sorry FB and TSLA).

Let's start with **AAPL**:

Apple's stock has held up the best out of the Big Tech names so far.  It's only down about 10% from its ATH earlier in January.  It has shown relative outperformance compared to its peers recently.  How come?

To start with, AAPL posted its best string of 4 quarters since 2012.  They grew quarterly revenues by an average of 35% YoY:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue)

The only other 4Q stretch with a comparable average in that time span was Q4-2014 to Q3-2015 where they averaged \~25% revenue growth.  So this has been an incredible 4 quarter run for Apple.  They have seen price growth from both multiple expansion and sales growth in that time frame.  Between 2009 and 2019, this stock traded below a 20 PE.

Why?  Because the market stopped viewing it as a growth stock.  Today that's all changed and it's going for a PE of 29+.  Until it shows signs of slowing, this PE is more than reasonable.  Apple's EPS rose by 66.22% YoY for Q3 in 2021.  A single year of 45%+ EPS growth would compress their current PE ratio below 20.  This company is absolutely worth the high PE right now, unless you have reason to believe their earnings will start disappointing this quarter and beyond.

A PE ratio is a snapshot in time.  Growing your profit at a 65% clip YoY cuts your PE ratio by over a third in one year.  Even at half the earnings growth from last year, it would be undervalued today, IMO.  That would put it at around 22 PE next year at current prices.  Hardly expensive for a company like Apple in a growth spurt.

Now let's check out **GOOG**:

This one is my favorite.  While stocks like Apple have much more volatile earnings growth over the past decade, GOOG is nearly the most reliable grower you could ever find.  And they've also had a ridiculous past 4 quarters, posting average revenue growth of 40% YoY on a quarterly basis for the past 4 quarters.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue)

Google has only had 2 negative revenue growth quarters YoY since 2006.  This includes the GFC, rising interest rates in 2018, and COVID.  This thing just keeps churning out more money every single quarter.  Their earnings growth is more sporadic, but for good reason.  They are heavily reinvesting into R&D and are dominant in many different verticals.

YouTube is Google.  Maps are Google.  Android is Google.  Play Store is Google.  Gmail is Google.  Chrome is Google.  Cloud.  Their autonomous vehicle project Waymo is widely regarded as the industry leader.  And of course Google Search is the most lucrative advertising engine in the history of the Earth.

Google also trades at a low PE historically.  Today it's about 25.7.  The lowest it's been since 2015 is \~21 in 2019.  This is a company that is heavily prioritizing revenue growth over earnings.  There are many times in history where Google was trading at 30, 40, even 50 PE ratio.  They spent 42% of their net income this year ($30B) on Research & Development.  

If you added that back into their NI, they'd be trading at a PE below 20.  On a company which grows revenue in 96%+ of every quarter since 2006.

Next up, let's look at **MSFT:**

MSFT, similarly to Apple, had a rough Q2-2015 to Q2-2016.  Big negative revenue growth.  Since then though, they've increased YoY quarterly revenue in 95% of every quarter.  The only other negative quarter since was -3.19% (Q2-2017).  Their average quarterly YoY revenue growth since Q2-2016 is about 15%.

This one is trading at a 33.74 PE ratio.  Definitely on the higher end since 2006, but MSFT was a bit lost once Apple released the iPhone.  The market overestimated the importance of mobile to the company.    In the last 4 quarters MSFT has averaged 45% YoY revenue growth.  They also have better gross margins than Apple / Google.

MSFT is probably fine, but their history shows volatility in revenue growth and their multiple is higher than their peers.  I have no doubt the company will continue to crush long term, but I think it's the riskier buy right now, because they are trading much higher than their traditional PE.  A single earnings miss could easily cost them 15%+ in this environment.

Finally we have **AMZN**:

AMZN is the GOAT at revenue growth.  Even Google can't touch the consistency of AMZN.  Since 2006, their YoY quarterly revenue growth has always been positive.  Think about how absurd that is.  60+ quarters of consistent revenue growth.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue)

Even crazier, their lowest YoY quarterly revenue growth in that timespan... 14.6% (Q4-2014).  What an absurd company.  They had some massive growth during the height of the Pandemic.  They've had trouble growing on top of those big gains, but they ARE still growing, even compared to their revenues during the lockdowns of 2020 when everyone was using Amazon for everything.

Q4 earnings will obviously be a big deal here since they get a big boost for the holidays.  It will be difficult to top their $125.55B in revenue from Q4 2020, but the market seems to believe it's possible.  10% growth in revenue YoY would be their slowest quarterly gain since 2006, so the bar is pretty high!

This is a company which has historically traded at huge PE.  Amazon has continued to prioritize growth and there's no reason to doubt them now.  E-commerce has really been put on fast forward through the Pandemic.  Not to mention their AWS platform which prints money.  

They also spend huge on R&D.  $42.7B in 2020.  That's about twice their Net Income.  So if you combine that with their earnings, their PE is slashed by 66% to 19.75.  If you want to talk moats, Amazon's ecommerce platform is insane.  The amount of investment and efficiency needed to provide their service is just unimaginable.  

Walmart is the nearest with their Walmart+ subscription, which they claim has 32M users.  Amazon Prime has over 200M.  Amazon has also made a big step into video games.  They own Twitch, the top streaming platform, and their New World MMORPG has gotten some good traction.  Long story short, Amazon's cemented into our lives and is not going anywhere.  Plenty of potential new countries for global expansion as well.

**Overall environment:**

**Are these stocks trading at historically high multiples?**  That seems to have been the narrative over the past year or two.  Multiple expansion due to the Fed's easy money policies.  Valuations outpacing results.  In terms of Big Tech, I'm not really seeing this.  Especially in AMZN and GOOG, the multiples are at historically low levels.

Multiples are also irrelevant without factoring in growth.  These companies have increased earnings and revenues at a huge clip since COVID.  The world has become increasingly online.  While this effect may subside slightly, there is some permanence to it as well.  We have permanently changed the way we work and our behavior.  

If these companies can continue to grow revenues, which AMZN and GOOG have done in over 95% of quarters dating back to 2006, they will continue to greatly outperform the market in the medium/long term.  The current valuations seem:

* Bad-very bad if growth slows considerably or goes negative
* Fine if growth slows and trends towards historic averages
* Good-great if growth continues at current rates
* Amazing if growth accelerates

So unless you are expecting a major reversal on big tech earnings, and think that the companies will start seeing considerable revenue growth contraction, my opinion is that these stocks are actually pretty cheap at these prices.  My top pick is GOOG which will benefit from reopening, since they will capture growth from travel industry and other reopening plays.  While some stocks may see headwinds from a reopened world, GOOG seems to win either way.  They're also priced very reasonably on a historic basis.",2022-01-22,29,15

Six Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers were confirmed dead on Saturday after a series of tornadoes roared through a warehouse near St. Louis, ripping off its roof and causing 11-inch thick concrete walls longer than football fields to collapse on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.

Witnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find. ""I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,"" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street. ""People had to think on their feet quick."" Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area. Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.

It was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said. Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel. Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. ""We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,"" she told Reuters. 

Earlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter that the company was ""heartbroken over the loss"" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community. ""All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,"" Bezos wrote. The billionaire had been in Texas earlier in the day to greet astronauts, including the daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard and former NFL star Michael Strahan, as they returned from a space trip aboard his Blue Origin rocket.",2021-12-13,2061,377

qwvjvw_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN Debit Spreads," I have been playing debit spreads on SPY and doing pretty good. When the index moves, the prices move logically with it.

For the last day or two my attention has turned to AMZN debit spreads. What is the deal with the bid and ask? Its ALL OVER THE PLACE.

For example. AMZN jumped today...so if I bought debit spreads near the beginning of the day, towards the middle of the day those debit spreads were now deep in the money. If SPY moved like this, those debit spreads deep in the money would be close to .92 on a dollar spread. Logical. However AMZN on a 5 dollar spread would have prices bouncing around flashing at 4.35, then 2.25 then 1.80 then suddenly 3.83, then 4.10 again, all over the place.

How can anyone trade this? How could buyers and sellers agree on a price? Are you telling me I can go in the money and pick a debit spread and wait for the price while I am sitting there watching it for 5 minutes and get in when it bounces down to 1.80 and then wait a few minutes while the prices are jumping all over the place then sell it for a few minutes later for 4.10? That doesnt make sense to me.

Last two earning have been bad due to high expectation, e-commerce demand has dropped since lockdown and higher labor cost eating into profit. (All well known facts)

But here is why you should look past all that, and adding more AMZN to your portfolio will payoff big time. If you look closely in their earnings report, they are spending like crazy in their logistic business this also includes last mile delivery and EV investment.

This is a company that generates revenue of over $400B a year, as soon as they make their operation more efficient and spending drops. Its going to generate amazing profit. 

On top of this their selfdriving division Zoox is now running Level 3 autonomous in seattle and announcing project kuiper partnership with verizon. And ofc AWS is still growing over 30% which is nuts since they are already a market leader. 

Bottomline is AMZN has lot of things going for at the moment and lot of catalyst can send this stock to moon. Here is my list

* Integrating Zoox and Project Kuiper with Prime

Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would’ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&nbsp;

- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I’m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL’s privacy policy in, I don’t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its’ earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I’m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. 

&nbsp;

- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don’t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it’s best not to gamble this time round.

Hey guys, been super lazy to type these out. Don't blame me, blame me the QOPEX seasonality, it always gets the best of us haha. This breakdown is from a trade I took today

Theme of the trade: Downtrend Channel breakout, bearish wedge invalidation

Background:

1. Ever since AMZN hit that contentious 3540 resistance, it has found itself trapped in its downtrend channel, helped ofcourse by the usual pre-MOPEX market weakness
2. AMZN was positioning into a bearish wedge with the 3405 support as the base of this positioning. However, this allowed the 3405 horizontal support lvl to converge with the lower bound of the downtrend channel it's been in
3. Given it was a high volume day today, I was standing by for a breakout in either direction. Although arguably I had a slight bearish bias thus far given how weak it was in the face of resistance when it trekked to the 3520+ supply zone
4. However, the support refused to budge and quickly price was testing the bounds of this wedge
5. It had a high volume break of the wedge soon after. While this in itself might have been enough breakout confirmation in other cases, AMZN faced significant headwind ahead in the form of 3420 resistance.
6. Crucially SPY, which had a Long Delta positioning at 440 and the Gamma Flip at the 443 strike, proved support at the 443 Gamma Flip lvl and broke out beautifully out of the wedge it had coiled itself in, at 12:24 PM
7. While SPY was breaking upwards out of the wedge, AMZN was positioned at the 3420 resistance
8. Aided by the tailwind from SPY and the strength of its own price action, I saw the confluence of both the market's and AMZN's inherent strength and entered my position

Entry1: BTO AMZN 09/17 3440c @ 15.60 per contract at 12:27 PM

Trade Playout:

1. TBH After this point it was one of those few trades where you go green the moment you enter and I credit waiting on the right entry (breakout confirmation w/ volume + market strength)
2. Now it was only a matter of letting the price play out and not micro managing the trade.
3. With persistent high volume buying, price quickly floated up to the 3442 resistance. Co-incidentally, the downtrend channel upper bound also converged with this resistance lvl, making this zone doubly hard to get past.
4. Right as price peeked a little past the 3442 resistance, it was met with the first proper opposition since breaking above the 3420 lvl. I took profits on my position when we got a adequate volume Bearish Engulfing candle at 13:05. Since this was right at both the horizontal and channel resistance, there was always risk of the price rejecting the resistance hard and turning on you quick. It is prudent then to not get greedy and cash in on your winnings.

Exit1:STC AMZN 09/17 3440c @ per 24.50 contract at 13:06 PM

Trade Continuation:

1. Right after I took profits, I continued to monitor the ticker due to it being right at the edge of its downtrend channel, apart from having a beautiful high volume day.

It could either breakout of the channel here or reverse hard, and I was waiting around to play either scenario

2. Just like clockwork, price started to coil, putting in Higher Lows and Lower Highs on the back of progressively decreasing volume, signalling consolidation before a big move

3. As price continued to coil, it became apparent that it was forming a Bull Pennant.

4. If you have been following my Trade Breakdowns thus far you know what it means when price is forming a bull/bear pennant (or flag) right below/above a major support/resistance lvl

5. As I have repeated over and over, always wait on CONFIRMATION before playing breakouts.

6. As volume returned, right at 13:30 PM the end of lunch time on the dot no less, price broke out of the pennant with admirable strength.

7. The bull pennant breakout helped kill two birds with one stone and as price broke through two very imp resistance lvls, this spectacular show of strength meant a protracted move would occur.

Entry2: BTO AMZN 09/17 3500c @ 4.50 per contract at 13:45 PM

Trade Playout:

1. With the grunt work behind us, it was time for us to reap the rewards from the work the buyers put in overwhelming all those sellers
2. Like I keep repeating you only make money when you let price do what it does, and I left the trade to its own devices, to let it float up to the next resistance at 3469
3. To my luck, just as I was about to take profit when the price hit the 3469 lvl, it smashed thru that lvl and ran for some more points. Doesn't hurt to be lucky from time to time, no doubt
4. However, since my Trading Plan had been achieved already, I thought better of pushing my luck further and took profits on the close of the candle

Exit2: STC AZN 09/17 3500c @ per 11.50 contract at 15:06 PM

Trade Notes:

1. This trade is a great example in why it pays (literally) to wait on price action to develop and why it is PARAMOUNT to wait on breakout confirmation before entering
2. Highlights how it helps to use greater market strength to confirm the directionality of your trade, and also why when you see price trying to tell you something, you drop all your biases and listen. Going into the trade I had a bearish bias but I abandoned that as soon as I saw price positioning for an upwards breakout. Price doesn't care about you, your feelings, your opinion, or your bias. Price is the only TRUTH",2021-09-15,58,32

Just a quick update to that post.

2024 options only went up to like $3640 for some reason this morning and that was to much, so went 6/23. Limit hit when it went down and then I put limit above ask on the .06 delta call and it hit. Experimenting by buying AMZN shares w premiums from selling the calls. Did sell out of SPY position to do this, but I do have .1 shares left ;)

Did also do 100 shares of FUBO and 2 2024 $30 LEAPS. So at least I got my first 2024 call anyways.

I plan on keeping everyone posted on progress along the way and good luck and long runways to all!

p50n5p_AMZN,AMZN,$AMZN is up to something with $AFRM - Obsessive DD,"Hello. On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says ""Pay over time with Affirm"" in the tab title, and, if you're on the app it says ""Search in Pay over time with Affirm"" in the search bar. ipad view: https://imgur.com/rGLmrwy

If you do a ""view page source"" you can ctrl+F and see the ""08-12"" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.

Now let's explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific ""node ID"" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011

Upon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product. For instance, this is what the url for their Kindle overview page looks like: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17717476011 An identical URL with a different node ID.

It seems very unlikely they set up a specific node ID url if something wasn't brewing.

Now lets look at other evidence. A few months ago, someone noticed during checkout the word ""option"" that had not been there before, yet there was only one pay over time option. See the third line down: https://imgur.com/g0jqN4c

Someone also noticed that when you used to search for ""Amazon Affirm"" on google it used to come up with a robo-generated search result mentioning Affirm. They do this with basically anything you search to generate clicks. But, a couple months ago, this robo-generated search result removed as if they were trying to hide something. Here is what used to come up: https://imgur.com/3uE52wt

So what could all this mean? It could be something as simple as Amazon will promote Affirm's upcoming debit card on their website, but why would they promote a competing card? At the moment Amazon only offers their own cards. Or.. it could be a full-blown partnership or buyout. We don't know, but something is going on.

Also, don't question why I was routinely visiting error message URLs. I have no life and was hoping one day I'd find something and I did.",2021-08-15,1308,483

Amazon is an American multinational technology company focused primarily on eCommerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company operates a marketplace for consumers, sellers, and content creators. It offers merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers.

The company has six business segments:

1. **Online Stores** — *51% of Revenue* — Offer consumer products through online stores, including fulfilment and shipping.
2. **Physical Stores** — *4% of Revenue* — Offer consumer products through physical stores.

6. **Other** — *6% of Revenue* — Primarily advertising services.

The company has expanded into new business segments over time, but it remains, primarily, an online retailer.

[Amazon is still, primarily, an online retailer.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa85629d1-3f66-4c83-9436-0e54112d8070_1692x806.png)

Despite being a multinational company, Amazon still gets the majority of its revenues from the United States. In fact, \~90% of its revenues come from just four countries: The US, Germany, The UK and Japan.

[Despite being a multinational, Amazon still gets the vast majority of revenue from the US.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43c930fa-4e78-45fb-8aba-324212995b10_1692x806.png)

Amazon is the world’s largest online marketplace, artificial intelligence assistant provider, and cloud-computing platform by revenue. Moreover, it is the largest Internet company and the second-largest private-sector employer in the US.

The company is known for disrupting well-established industries by applying technological innovation at a massive scale. Amazon enables authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content via its branded websites.

Amazon also provides Kindle Direct Publishing, an online platform that allows independent authors and publishers to make their books available in the Kindle Store. In addition, the сompany offers co-branded credit card agreements and advertising services, serves developers and enterprises through Amazon Web Services, and manufactures and sells electronic devices.

The company owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Ring, Shopbop, Twitch, and Whole Foods Market. It distributes various downloadable and streaming content through its Prime Video, Music, Twitch, and Audible subsidiaries.

#### The Timeline

Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in his garage in Bellevue, Washington, in July 1994. He started the company as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded into electronics, video games, software, furniture, food, toys, and jewellery.

* 1994 — Jeff Bezos founds Amazon.
* 1997 — IPO at $18/share. Launches second distribution centre.
* 1998 — Acquires IMDb and expands into CDs and DVDs.
* 1999 — Expands into toys and secures 1-click patent.
* 2002 — Starts selling clothes.
* 2003 — Launches AWS.
* 2005 — Amazon Prime launched.
* 2006 — AmazonFresh launched.
* 2007 — Kindle launched.
* 2008 — Acquires Audiobooks company which becomes Audible.
* 2011 — Kindle Fire launched to Enter the tablet market.
* 2014 — Launches smartphones and acquires Twitch ($970M).
* 2015 — Amazon Echo becomes widely available.
* 2017 — Whole Foods acquisition ($13.7B).
* 2018 — Acquires Ring ($839M) and passes $1T market capitalisation.
* 2021 — Acquires MGM ($8.45B).

Jeff Bezos, who has led the company since he founded it, stood down as CEO in February this year and announced that he would transition to Executive Chair of the Board. Andy Jassy, who is currently the CEO of AWS, is set to take over from Jeff.

The company has been heavily criticised for its practices, including surveillance overreach, demanding and competitive working conditions, potential tax avoidance and potentially anti-competitive behaviour. As Amazon has grown, it has become an enormous target for regulatory agencies and antitrust suits.

>*“Last week saw the filing of two more such suits, claiming the Seattle-based e-commerce giant’s policies drive up prices. Those cases bring the number of antitrust actions lodged against Amazon since last March to at least 16.”*

#### The Financials

Amazon is one of those businesses that feel like it’s simultaneously been around forever but also just started up. That’s probably because it is. It only took Jeff Bezos 24 years to take Amazon from garage start-up to trillion-dollar company. Mind-blowing! Especially when compared to Apple, which was founded in 1976 and beat Amazon to a trillion by a matter of weeks.

[The Amazon sprint from IPO to $1T company.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37661c25-ed0c-4e7a-af5b-1756b80852f2_2400x1163.png)

After a barely noticeable market capitalisation in 1996, Amazon took off during the dot-com boom. Still, as the bubble collapsed, the company lost \~80% of its capitalisation in 2000 alone as capital markets dried up for tech companies.

This was not good news for the rapidly expanding but loss-making Amazon, which needed access to capital. After this near-death experience, Amazon spent *all* of the following two decades continuing to expand and grow.

[Year after year, Amazon continues to grow.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e50031-efa8-43e3-b39e-5a840b7b3bb9_2400x1167.png)

The company's growth was other-worldly in the early years, partly because it was a tiny start-up with less than a million dollars in revenues in 1995, partly because of Bezos’s growth ambitions. Revenues reach $2.76 billion by 2020, and the TTM to Q2 2021 were over $443B.

[Growth was stratospheric in the early years. But, impressively, it has stayed high ever since.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48605a31-8023-439a-b7a0-1de2bd9181a5_2400x1157.png)

One of the impressive things about Amazon is that it has maintained an incredibly high growth rate despite its increasing size. Typically, the larger a company gets, the harder it becomes to grow at a meaningful clip. Amazon has defied this with their willingness to reinvest virtually all operating profits, acquire new businesses, and expand into almost any line of business imaginable.

Amazon has *never* registered a TTM period with revenues lower than the last. In fact, the slowest twelve-month period of growth for Amazon was 2001, when they grew at a *pathetic* 13%.

[Amazon has never registered a period of negative growth.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98288136-d47b-4497-ba46-39b7c928c6b0_2400x1163.png)

However, on the income front, the story has not been as positive. While enormous operating losses in the ‘90s are explained by the company being a young growth company, it became increasingly difficult to justify these losses into the early ‘00s. In fact, Amazon was still registering operating losses six years after its IPO.

Further, rather than operating margins improving over time as the economies-of-scale kick in, which is what you would expect in growth companies, Amazon's margins have not only stayed low but have periodically declined. This suggests that either the company is not reaping the benefits of scale or is operating with a very different agenda and sees maturity at a scale far beyond anything we could previously have imagined.

\--

#### The Previous Valuation - October 2020

When [I valued Amazon in October last year](https://valuabl.substack.com/p/valuation-amazoncom-inc), I told a story about an enormous online retailer investing everything in growth. I said that they would continue to grow rapidly but that their businesses would start to mature and see the benefits of the enormous scale.

Further, I suggested that this scale would help them keep costs low and earn above industry profit margins. I said that they could use these profits, along with their enormous data troves, to continuing acquiring other companies in a successful and value-adding way.

However, I finished off by suggesting that Amazon could become a victim of its success and was likely to be the target of significant antitrust regulation and even a forced break-up.

I valued the shares around $2,600-$2,700 and assigned a ‘Reduce’ rating based on my Monte-Carlo simulation and the stock price of $3,200. Since then, the stock price has held up, and it currently trades around $3,300.

#### The Story

*Amazon is the most feared disruptive platform in history. The company has benefited from the pandemic and will continue to reinvest aggressively to continue growing rapidly. They will expand and disrupt new markets and continue using their dominance and scale to negotiate lower costs and benefit from massive economies of scale. But, their size has put a target on their back, and meaningful antitrust regulation could be just around the corner.*

**Total Market** — Amazon is so massive and sprawling that it operates in six connected global markets that I have estimated are worth $26.8T in aggregate. I have listed them out [here](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c25d337-d61b-455b-94e5-5ad126929dcf_427x170.png).

We can see that economists expect the Digital Media, Cloud Web Servers and Digital Advertising markets to be the fastest-growing. In contrast, they expect the retail (both on and offline) and logistics markets to grow much more slowly.

When I weigh the market growth forecasts by Amazon’s segment weights, I get an expected Market CAGR for Amazon of 8.75%.

**x Market Share** — Amazon is a behemoth with access to deep pools of capital. The company has proven its willingness to spend and lose enormous sums to enter new markets and disrupt incumbents. Further, they are becoming increasingly acquisitive in recent years, especially in industries that border their own. Whole Foods and MGM are examples.

They’re currently *only* 1.8% of the aggregate global market, but this is more a reflection of how enormous these markets are, especially physical retail, than the company. However, if we ignore physical retail (\~4% of the company’s revenue), Amazon has a 5.7% market share in an $8.3T market that will grow at 9%. I think this is a more authentic reflection of the company’s position. I believe that Amazon will continue to reinvest aggressively to expand into new markets and countries and take market share.

**= Revenue** — I have modelled Amazon to grow at an 18% CAGR. This rate is at the lower end of their historical range but is higher than analyst consensus (17%). This growth rate implies that Amazon will achieve sales of $1.5T by 2030 and have almost 8% of their non-physical retail markets.

This assumption is not one I take lightly. Turning over that much in a single year is mind-boggling. It is \~$48k per second. It is the entire 2020 GDP of countries like Russia, Brazil, Australia or Spain. Turnover of $1.5T in 2030 would make Amazon 1.25% of 2030 Global GDP compared to the 0.55% it is currently.

But, the Amazon platform is becoming so ubiquitous that it is the primary, and often only, sales channel for many other companies — one that many businesses and customers can’t walk away from.

**Less: Costs** — I believe that Amazon will continue to use its dominant position to drive down costs and eventually raise prices. Moreover, when the company begins to mature and stabilise, the incredible economies of scale will reduce fixed costs as a percentage of the cost base.

**= Operating Income** — I have modelled for operating margins to continue growing from their current level (\~9.5% on an R&D adjusted basis) and reach 13.50% by 2026. This would be almost double the weighted average of the company's industries (6.9% margins) and would result in a yearly NOPAT of nearly $150B by 2030.

The company has a regulatory target on its back that I believe inhibits margins from expanding much further. Significant price rises or margins getting much bigger would be massive red flags for global regulatory bodies and would encourage them to step in more aggressively.

**Less: Taxes** — I have modelled the company’s tax rate to rise from its current effective rate of \~12.4% to my estimate of its country-weighted rate of 26.82%. The company also has a $13.4 NOL tax shield.

**Less: Reinvestment** — The company is going to have to continue reinvesting huge sums. It currently produces $1.93 of sales from every dollar of invested capital. I have modelled for this to continue, resulting in over $530B of additional net capital poured into the business over the next ten years.

**= Free Cash Flows** — Based on the above, I have forecast that the company will remain FCF positive and won’t need to raise any additional capital.

**Adjust For: Time Value & Risk** — Amazon is an online retail (51%), physical retail (4%), logistics (21%), entertainment (7%), cloud services (12%), and advertising (6%) business. It gets 69% of revenue from the US, 9% from Germany, 6% from the UK, 6% from Japan, and 11% from the rest of the world. The company has a 0.5x operating leverage ratio and a 7.1% D/E ratio.

Moody’s has assigned Amazon an A1/A+ rating and says:

>“Amazon's ratings continue to recognize its powerful brand, which is synonymous with online retail throughout most of the world, as well as the strength and profitability of Amazon Web Services (""AWS""). AWS accounts for the majority of the company's operating income and free cash flow supporting Amazon's ability to make strategic investments in its retail operations. In addition to its leading competitive position in both online retail and web services, Amazon also has a solid ecosystem of entertainment content and a formidable third-party seller business.”  
— [Moody’s Investor Services, 10 May 2021](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Amazon-to-A1--PR_445977)

I have gone with their rating. Usually, I would give a 1.08% chance of distress to companies with this rating based on the historical data. But, for Amazon, I have bumped this to 3% to accommodate for the chance of severe antitrust regulation forcing a breakup of the business or significantly inhibiting growth/profitability.

**Add: Non-Operating Assets** — $7.3B worth of investments carried at fair value.

**Less: Debts & Other Claims** — $121B in debts and leasehold commitments.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere.

Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....

&#x200B;

Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:

&#x200B;

# What's the deal:

&#x200B;

In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.

&#x200B;

The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.

&#x200B;

# Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:

&#x200B;

Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.

&#x200B;

# Why does any of this matter?

&#x200B;

Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.

&#x200B;

So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.

MGM owns a major film library, with interests in the long-running James Bond franchise as well as other well-known titles such as Rocky and Pink Panther. It also owns the Epix cable channel and makes TV shows, including The Handmaid’s Tale and Fargo, and reality shows such as Shark Tank and Survivor. An acquisition would beef up Amazon’s film studio and streaming services Prime Video and IMDB. A deal could cost between $7 billion and $10 billion.

some more info

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

I'm struggling to find anything that fits his criteria in the current market.

Am I doing it wrong or is it just the fact that this market is insane?

And another question: I'm seeing some very high-quality companies like AMZN do poorly on his basic criteria. AMZN only posted 10% ROIC once in the past 10 years, for example.

kdf4gv_AMZN,AMZN,"Relfection on three trades from today, on accidental 3M charts. Happens. 1 winner and 2 losers $AMZN $NVAX $TSM","Today was interesting, mainly because I unknowingly made the rookie mistake of trading off of the 3min chart instead of the 5m. I didn't catch it until tonight when I came back to review trades. I do like the 3min for open, but I have been skipping open for a few weeks now and am mostly a 5m/10m/1h chart trader. 

&#x200B;

[$AMZN 3m](https://preview.redd.it/9c8ktqkb1a561.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8a3ad363c3cbac9300ba891138b3dc8aa635d9)

$SPY was heading lower and $AMZN was flagging after being rejected for a second higher high on lower volume. MACD down, Stoch down, RSI down. I drew a few trendlines to help my decision, but unfortunately was not quick enough to get my stop limit set and entered with a stop (I put stops for entry in initially because is that is how my default brackets are set up, I then edit them to stop limits for better fills (sometimes no fills)). My fill as bad as there is a large spread on $AMZN.  I took profit below VWAP for 2R and some change, with more not ideal fills. 

[TSM 3m](https://preview.redd.it/qghxunlz3a561.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=66894088dd4cdfc36816073686dc7739eb670e8b)

This one I saw price wicking support on increasing volume. I entered at the break of support / pre-market highs but also due to the 3m chart I assume, I was over anticipating the move and couldn't get my stop limit in so bad fill again. MACD turning up but choppy, stochastic up, RSI ranging. I put my stoploss below my entry bar since the fill made my R:R trickier to make work, I would have needed an 80c for 2R if I put my stop under the lowest recent wick and 20EMA cloud where I originally planned. I didn't see TSM making a huge move today just a pop with the way the market was performing. I was stopped out, for a small loss, In hindsight I should of just left this ticker alone due to volume, or traded short for the midday fade after the lower low / triple top. 

[NVAX 3m](https://preview.redd.it/ahew5ukd5a561.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3f0fcd48bbf3878f56effdb650011d3b6ea48a)

Same deal, drew trends that made sense to me. Took $NVAX short on the break of the trend, my stop was 130.30. We actually hit 2R on this trade, but I had my limit to cover at the red line (prior support from yesterday and personal approx 6R target), which wasn't hit until later. A good lesson for me, because I put this trade on and then headed to work and was stopped out. When AFK it may be better to trail my trades instead of stop/limit if I am going for above 2R targets. That way my stop is automatically moved to breakeven. I haven't decided how to handle this, as I generally have bad luck with trailing stops. The reason I was going for 6R is just that I chose to trade a technical target instead of R and I had a short bias on $NVAX for today, which happened to be 6R. I always make sure each trade has the potential to move to at least 2R but I prefer 3R+ with ideal entry. If I was at my computer I would of scaled out 1/2 or 1/4 at 2R. Oh well.

FB has been trending in an upward channel divided by a top and bottom half. On Monday last week it has broken through the middle into the bottom half, tested the 55 EMA (green line) and passed the test, meaning it held the level. $270.50 will be the key level to watch this week.

If it can hold $270.50 it has room to test $280, if that is claimed, then room to the middle of the channel at $285.30. If that level can be claimed, then room to $292.50

If it cannot hold the $276.50 level, then room to test last days' lows around $274. If that level is broken to the downside, then it has room to test the 55 EMA (green line) at $269.50. It is also the bottom of the channel, so will be a very strong level to test. If it breaks that with conviction to the downside then room down to $259 and lower.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral/Bullish
Options: If it holds $276.50 then looking at NOV 27 $290 Calls: If it cannot hold looking at Nov 27 $265 Puts.

AMZN

AMZN has been one of those stocks impacted positively by the pandemic. It has been performing very well in the last months. Nevertheless it has been in consolidation mode recently trading between $2870 and $3550. At th moment the stock has been rejected by the 55 EMA (green line) to the downside, and is now slowly retracing back up to test it. The key level to watch for this week will be $3110.

If it can hold $3110, then it has room to the 55 EMA (green line) at $3160. If it can reclaim that level then room to test $3225. If it can claim that level, then room to $3289.

If it cannot hold $3110 then room down to test $3080. If that level cannot hold, then room down to $3020, and if that doesn't hold, then room to test ercent lows at $2951.70. Next level after that is a strong support at $2871.

Overall Sentiment: Netural/Bullish
Options: If it can hold $3110, then looking at NOV 27 $3200 Calls: If it cannot hold the NOV 27 $3110 then looking at $3050 Puts

AAPL

Apple is the most popular stock out there. After an incredible run it has been consolidating between the $100 and $135 range, getting tighter and tighter as the weeks pass since it hit All Time Highs early September. It is currently, trying to reclaim and trade on levels above the 118 support. $118 and $115 will be key level to watch this week.

If it can hold the $118 level with conviction, room to $121.50, and if it holds that it can test $125 which is recent highs.

If it cannot hold $118 then it will go down to $115 and test the 55 EMA (green line). If it cannot hold that then room to $112.25.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral
Options: If it can hold $118 looking at the Nov 20 $125 Calls: If it cannot hold $118 looking at $115 Puts, if it starts to fall hard then roll into $110 (lots of volume and cheap)

jkhs1v_AMZN,AMZN,"Amazon beats, Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 expected, Revenue: $96.15b vs $92.7b expected","(CNBC) Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

jkcp8b_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Apple earnings condor, also expected moves in GOOGL AMZN FB","Obviously a massive day for earnings. The VIX is near 40, and that means expected moves for all stocks have expanded. 7 day expected moves for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook are now about 25% more than they were at this time last week, now having to incorporate the election and broader market vol. However... because it's Thursday we get a pretty good sense of the event moves themselves using tomorrow's expiration. Here's how the expected moves for tomorrow's close look for the big 4 reporting tonight:

**Amazon / 4.9%**

[chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-29-at-9.58.06-AM.png)

&#x200B;

Here's how that expected move translates into the condor in AAPL for tomorrow's expiry. It's weird seeing numbers so small for AAPL post split, is the 10 wide condor too tight? $5 moves don't seem very big but it is a different stock now at 114, the risk-reward is decent for something so binary and getting it as close to 1 to 1 is ideal (if possible).

iholti_AMZN,AMZN,Bezos will split AMZN at least 5-for-1. Here's the DD.,"Being a poorfag wanting to buy some AMZN $4000 10/16, I was saddened by both the need to plop $3000 per contract, and get reamed by the $1.50 in bid/ask spread. 

So looking for DD starting from my favorite site, Google Images, I noticed many signs that confirms a split will be coming, with the number 5 being the most likely. 

1. Bezos has already showed his affinity for a split, most famously from his wife, the ultimate girl-chad who if Elon wasn't already in a relationship, would definitely try to get his FUNDING SECURED from. 

&#x200B;

[At least 2 for 1 split](https://preview.redd.it/zpri3bswpkj51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=523a6fb45f443862e39d7ac610c2a016b9b786f9)

2. Like how his Highness [tweeted on 5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibfipq/musk_is_genius/), covertly giving everyone the signal that TSLA will be split 5 for 1, Bezos has been giving the signal throughout the years.

&#x200B;

3. Even at a 5 for 1 split, AMZN would be at around $600, far beyond the reach of the average autismo or retard. But good news, I also found this super secret image, where Bezos is flashing the ""Double BULLGANG symbol"", indicating a possible 10 for 1 split.

Because of the previous successes with Tim Apple and Elon Musk, Bezos will definitely feel cucked if he doesn't split. Worst case for him is that the original Cucc (Zucc the Cucc) beats him to it.",2020-08-27,1352,147

We expect 3Q guidance to fall above consensus on a revenue basis and inline/below on operating income as the company accelerates infrastructure investments to accommodate sustained growth in customer demand and avoid showing outsized profitability during the current crisis. The net increase in demand across all segments of Amazon’s business and Amazon’s ability to meet the challenges of this demand is, we believe, serving to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen its competitive moats. While the stock has outperformed the majority of Internet significantly YTD, we believe the market continues to underestimate the long-term value of the Amazon platform as the leader in both the movement of retail online and compute into the cloud, the realization of which is being accelerated by the current crisis. Therefore, we continue to believe Amazon represents the best risk/reward in the Internet sector and remain Buy-rated (CL) with a $3,800 12-month price target.""*

**Jefferies**: *""Expectations are high heading into Q2 results on Thursday, w/ AMZN up 65% YTD and 34% since Q1. We expect AMZN to deliver, but prefer to focus on how recent changes in consumer behavior provide attractive long-term opportunities given most of the nearterm acceleration is priced in. We would also point to attractive valuation despite the YTD move, w/ current 28x NTM EV/EBITDA standing roughly in-line w/ 2017-18 despite a larger mix of high margin businesses.""*

**Barclays**: *""Buyside expectations for Retail revenue growth ex-FX are likely in the range of +40% Y/Y (vs. consensus +29%) and AWS “low 30%’s” Y/Y (vs. consensus +32%), and we expect largely in-line results. We also expect guidance to reflect some normalization in growth in late 3Q, similar to what the company guided 90 days ago, but also factoring in the shift in Prime Day to 4Q. There are few companies better positioned for the current environment than Amazon. Prime members rely on Amazon more than ever for essential and discretionary purchases, and few retailers have earned the trust and reliability that Amazon enjoys. Disruption with global supply chains, store closures, and Covid-fear among consumers has created a perfect storm whereby there seem to be few places other than Amazon where one can receive goods reliably and on time across 100m+ SKUs. The question we ask ourselves constantly is: how much longer can this dynamic play out, and what happens when growth trends normalize? June came and went without much deceleration for Amazon or ecommerce as a whole, despite economies re-opening (behavior appears to have changed semi-permanently in terms of the shift away from brick-and-mortar). At 20x 2021 EBITDA, the same level we were at before Covid, the risk/reward remains attractive.""*

**Telsey**: *"" We are raising our sales forecast for 2Q20 (up \~1% to \~29% to $81.6B) and 2020 (up \~1% to \~25% to $349.5B), given our view that Amazon has been seeing strong demand of both essentials and discretionary products. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online, which combined with US Government stimulus checks, temporary retail store closures, and ongoing retail consolidation, should generate solid results. In addition, the usage of advertising, music, movies, and gaming subscriptions is on the rise. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also should see sales accelerate, given the shift to cloud computing and remote offices/classrooms. That said, we are lowering our 2Q20 and 2020 profit forecasts due to incremental costs (including over $4B in 2020) related to COVID-19—unfavorable product mix, productivity headwinds from social distancing, investment in personal protective equipment, and higher wages and logistic costs, including faster delivery.""*

**Canaccord Genuity**: *"" We forecast \~27% y/y total revenue growth for Amazon in Q2 as the company likely saw accelerating growth for its online stores as a result of heightened eCommerce demand during the pandemic. We expect operating margin to be around breakeven, as management plans to reinvest virtually all of its Q2 operating profit into COVID-19-related safety initiatives and to ensure fulfillment efficiency. Amazon will also likely provide an update on recent trends for AWS.""*",2020-07-29,121,67

My personal opinion is that this is only the beginning of Plug Power’s stocks rise.  Both the technology and cost of Fuel cell and EV are reality today, just see purchases and interests in Tesla and Nikola.

Excerpt:
“We were introduced to Lightning Systems, which has done BEVs with Amazon as well as fuel cell electric vehicles. Amazon not only is one of our largest customers, but also is a shareholder of Plug Power. So they've introduced us to Lightning Systems.

1. Anti-trust debate - the benefits of large companies is being clearly demonstrated during this crisis - FB's apps enabling the sharp increase in communication, AMZN's logistics delivering critical goods to consumers, innovative health apps and 1m masks/week from AAPL. The rise of TikTok and Zoom also illustrate large companies are not stifling competition. In fact, they have allowed Americans (voters) to live better lives during this pandemic.
2. Privacy debate - data collection has driven rapid innovation during COVID (e.g. thermometer apps tracking virus spread across the US by location). Countries that appear to have greatest success at containing COVID-19 also have the most aggressive data gathering tools (e.g. China, Singapore).
3. fake news debate - FB and GOOGL have been proactively taking down false info during COVID-19, which appears to be helping their case to policy makers.

Finally, rather than furloughing employees, these big tech companies are hiring and helping to mitigate the economic stress during this crisis.

9c8nle_AMZN,AMZN,AMZN $2050 iron butterfly - bad idea?,"Someone please explain to my why this is a bad idea, it seems too good to be true. I want to sell a 9/21 or 9/28 iron butterfly for AMZN consisting of a 2040 long put, 2050 short put and short call, and 2060 long call. My plan is to close it early if/when it reaches 2050, which if I'm not mistaken is the price at which Amazon will reach 1 trillion market cap. As per Robinhood I can sell this iron butterfly for more than $900 credit, which means the max I can lose is less than $100. I know I won't get to keep the full $900+ if I close early, and I'm ok to lose $100 or so if the price doesn't go to 2050 before expiration. What's the catch here? Is there a high chance I'll get assigned on the short put early, since it's in the money, and most likely I'll just lose the $100? Would I not get filled if I try to close when it's around 2050, due to volatility or something else? Would I have to place a limit order ahead of time so I can ""catch"" it when I'm profitable, in case it decides to shoot up past my range before I can close? Would the amount I'd make if I close early too small for it to be worth it? The other thing I was considering was a 2040-2050 put credit spread, or even a put credit spread that's below the current price, but if the stock happens to go down I'd lose a lot more than with the iron butterfly. If I go the iron butterfly route, should I widen it so there's a wider range where I'm profitable? ",2018-09-02,10,25

How to Fight Amazon (Before You Turn 29): Lina Khan has a novel theory about monopolies—and her sights are set squarely on the company.      

BY ROBINSON MEYER    
The Atlantic - JULY/AUGUST 2018    
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/   

---


""About 44 cents of every dollar that Americans spend online go to Amazon.""    

""First, Khan says, Amazon has been willing “to sustain losses and invest aggressively at the expense of profits.” This isn’t a controversial assertion: Amazon has posted an annual profit for only 13 of the past 21 years""

""Second, Amazon is integrated vertically, across business lines. In addition to selling stuff online, Amazon now publishes books, extends credit, sells online ads, designs clothes, and produces movies and TV shows. It is also one of the world’s largest providers of cloud storage and computing power."" 

""These two practices—predatory pricing and integration across business lines—may sound normal. But under old readings of U.S. antitrust law, they are illegal.""

""And then, in 1978, a Yale Law professor named Robert Bork promoted a clean new theory of antitrust law, inspired by the libertarian Chicago school of economics. 
 Bork decreed that all antitrust suits should be judged by one question: What will most lower prices for consumers?""

""And predatory pricing? It is “a phenomenon that probably does not exist,” [Bork] wrote. The Chicago school, he said, had proved that companies would always pursue short-term profits over long-term growth.  Amazon’s history seems to belie this claim.""

"" ' When a company comes to monopolize a market—when it grows so big that it can threaten other industries just by entering them—it ceases to be merely a company. It becomes an institution so powerful that it can rule over people like a government. That was the insight of Brandeis,' ” [Khan said].

8cv489_MSFT,MSFT,"Microsoft ($725.09 B) just surpassed Alphabet/Google ($724.96 B) and Amazon ($697.84 B) in market cap, and with augmented reality, cloud computing, and the Surface lineup, MSFT is a BUY","Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon are neck and neck these days when it comes to technology and market cap. Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",2018-04-17,32,122

Zell: The stock market isn’t a reflection of the whole. It reflects a few companies that dominate: Amazon.com [AMZN] at 150 times earnings, instead of XYZ regular company at six times. Back in 1999, the first thing a company did was go public. Now we have unicorns, a very sophisticated form of avoiding price detection. That changes the whole perspective. In 1999, instead of Amazon, I talked about Cisco Systems [CSCO]. I said that at the growth rate on which it was being valued, it would be 25% of the U.S. economy in 10 years. Well you could say the same thing about Amazon—to justify 150 times earnings, you have to assume it will be 25% of the U.S. economy in 10 years. Not likely.""

2limne_AMZN,AMZN,Why does Amazon (AMZN) Keep Making These Stupid A** Products,"Is Jeff really such a moron? I can totally understand them diverging from their core delivery business into other ventures but why in god's name would you make a ton of second rate products that can't compete instead of making one good product. 

Why doesn't Amazon make a movie and music streaming service that can actually compete with Netflix and Spotfiy instead of some half ass wannabe. I literally just canceled my prime service because I realize all these ""Prime benefits"" aren't even being used because I prefer the market leader so much more. Don't even get me started at that retarded phone. ""OMG I can have my phone tell me what it is instead of reading the goddamn label."" How much drugs did the product development team feed the guys at their sales pitch to get that approved?

It's not quite done. Still have some work to do with deferred taxes, leases, and a couple other things, but before I spend too much more time with it I'd like to get your feedback. 

I should note a couple other things: 
-it's a zipped file that contains a single spreadsheet. If you don't want to risk opening a zipped file, I can probably figure out another way to send it to you

-I used the macabacus template as a starting point to build this

-I haven't actually ""valued"" the company. on the ""model"" sheet, rows 101-104 contain common valuation metrics (EV/FCF, etc). 

-On the ""assumptions"" sheet, you can change certain numbers that will automatically change the numbers in the ""model"" sheet. 

Anyways, here is the link.

Think about it in a macro sense, 

1 - get a grip on shipping expenses (it's biggest expense)
2 - get 100,000 brown trucks painted white with logo
3 - ancillary benefit of UPS drop off stores becoming Amazon drop offs/pick ups.

The arithmetic makes  macro sense.

Then the big one, E bay and Walmart left out in the cold as the ""Sprint"" using the towers for a fee too yet be determined.

Hatters, take a second to think about anytime antitrust has shot something down,,, the answer is ""0"" in the USA.

I would put the ionization at 52 - 54 b for the board to approve, but it would so,,,,,Bezeos worth it.

Putting E bay & Walmart in the back seat is worth it alone, no matter what credit card one has.
