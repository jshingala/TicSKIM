1ap0axq_ANET,ANET,ANET Set to Beat Earnings Again! Get Ready for Another Big Move!,"Hey fellow regards,

I've got some juicy DD on Arista Networks ($ANET), ER is due today AH. This cloud networking company has been straight fire lately, crushing earnings expectations like a boss. What do they do? They design and sell super fast, programmable switches for massive data centers, clouds, HPC (high-performance computing), and HFT (high-frequency trading) environments. Their secret sauce lies in their sick Extensible Operating System (EOS) that powers their whole lineup. 

Let me break down why I think we're gonna see another green dildo after hours today.

Consistent Track Record:

$ANET has been putting up big boy numbers, showing no mercy to those weak af earnings estimates. They've beaten the street twice in a row, with an average surprise rate of 12.77%. Just look at their last two reports:

    Q3 '23: Expected $1.58, Reported $1.83 (+15.82%)

    Q2 '23: Expected $1.44, Reported $1.58 (+9.72%)

    (in fact they have beat EPS expectations in every earnings report in the past 2 years)

Now that's how you crush expectations! 

Let's talk revenue growth because damn, Arista's doing things right over there! Check out these insane numbers:

    Sep '23: $1.51 billion, up 28.27% YoY

    Jun '23: $1.46 billion, up 38.70% YoY

    Mar '23: $1.35 billion, up 54.08% YoY

    Dec '22: $1.28 billion, up 54.71% YoY

These aren't just impressive figures; they're fucking phenomenal. Look at this beautiful graph: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/anet/revenue/. We're talking double-digit percentage increases YOY, meaning Arista's dominating their competition left and right. 

Stock chart looks absolutely beautiful too, it's going parabolic! Last 3 quarters were -15%, +19.5%, and +14% after ER.

Might be a nice opportunity, fellow wrinkled brains. Strong FOMO is going around after all those ER rocket concerts last week.

TLDR; $ANET calls might be worth an ER gamble.

Position: a single leap OTM call (400C) that I'm planning on diamond handing no matter what happens after ER. Gonna hold onto it until 2025 if I have to.^(GUH looks like I have to baghold it for a while)

# Results are in: 

Q4 EPS $2.08 Beats $1.70 Est. 

Sales $1.54B Beat $1.53B Est.

Arista Networks Sees Q1 Revenue $1.52B-$1.56B Vs $1.53B Est.; Non-GAAP Gross Margin Of ~62%; Non-GAAP Operating Margin Of ~42%.

Hoping for a V recovery, -5% now. But in typical WSB fashion, GUH!

# Conference call summary

> We outperformed in 2023.  The fourth quarter was one of our strongest international quarters in recent history.  We have more than doubled our enterprise revenue in the last three years and we’ve become the gold standard for networking. Since 2008, the bandwidth of data centers has grown 350-fold and has doubled in just the past two years. There are a small number of companies making very large bids for AI, and we’ve won most of these. AI is yet to come, but it is going to come, and we solve a common congestion problem with most AI networks.   
 
> Our guidance isn’t conservative. It is balanced. We’ve got a new CFO, and we’ve got things to work through as we transition into AI, so we will take it quarter by quarter and see how it goes, even though everyone who is buying from us has upped their Capex recently.

Edit: CPI might lift tech overall + maybe ANET price target upgrades tomorrow morning. Arista isn't Snapchat, even if it doesn't recover immediately, still a great long term hold.

Edit 2: CPI was shit, but ANET is recovering! ""Only"" -4% now. Gonna be a great mid to longterm hold.",2024-02-12,165,166

144nefq_ANET,ANET,Arista Networks - ANET,"Curious everyones take on selling CSP's and wheeling for CC's on ANET. The stock itself is at or undervalued. The financials (Y/Y growth, EPS growth, Cashflow, etc..) look incredible. I came from the tech sector for 20 years and know Arista to be a great company (I used to work for Cisco Systems before starting my own businesses) and I am familiar with their product direction which is also great. The premiums look great for both CSP's and CC's and have been selling slightly OOM CSP's on them for a few weeks now and they never get assigned and if they did the ATM CC's I'd sell on them would be just fine to me as well. Even if getting saddled with them for a hold would be low risk considering their financials show them as worth pretty much exactly what they are trading for which is usually more rare for a tech company that will tend to come with allot of over speculated share prices. The 6/30 P with 160 Strike is currently selling between 3.30 and 4.40. Curious on anyone else opinion who is good at evaluating wheeling vs long term holds on stocks like this",2023-06-08,1,2

That doesn't bother me as much as this: I put a stop loss in at 142.18, just under the support i've got there. It fills at 10:16 at 142.12. First I'm not seeing the stop should have triggered in the first place. Second, the low of the day is still sitting at 142.13 from 10:09. I think I attribute some wonkiness to paper trading, but that second shouldn't have happened. I'm using etrade, nothing on top. Big time newbie, sort of. Thanks for any thoughts.",2023-03-07,1,6
