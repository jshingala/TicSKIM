[ ](https://preview.redd.it/jpaqzewzlxgb1.png?width=2779&format=png&auto=webp&s=511cbcdb226778ef827a60f80d9bc0d48186c1b7)

Check out this mean-reversion strategy we've been testing on the ARKK ETF, using z-scores to predict price changes and outperforming a basic Buy & Hold.   
Quick primer on z-scores: they tell you how far off you are from the average in terms of standard deviations. Z-score of 1 means you're one standard deviation above, and -1 means one below.

Our strategy is all about mean reversion - the idea that prices, when they wander off, have a tendency to return home, so to speak.

Here's how it works: we calculate the z-score of ARKK ETF's return over the past 21 days. If the z-score dips below -1 (significantly below average), we go long, predicting a price surge. If it climbs above 1 (significantly above average), we go short, expecting a dip.  


* **Entry (Long)**: We enter a long position when the z-score goes below -1. This implies that the ETF's return is more than one standard deviation below the average return for the past 21 days, suggesting the price is relatively low and may revert to the mean.
* **Exit (Long)**: We exit the long position the next day, regardless of the z-score. This is a simplifying assumption for our backtest; in practice, you might want to consider holding the position for longer if the z-score remains below -1, or until the z-score crosses back above -1, indicating that the price has reverted to the mean.
* **Entry (Short)**: We enter a short position when the z-score goes above 1. This implies that the ETF's return is more than one standard deviation above the average return for the past 21 days, suggesting the price is relatively high and may revert to the mean.
* **Exit (Short)**: We exit the short position the next day, regardless of the z-score.

13zz6qk_ARKK,ARKK,ARKK is set to surge at least 86% in the next 1-2 years,"After being cast aside for the past 2 years and forming a strong basing pattern, ARKK is all set for it's next bull run. The blue zone highlighted on the chart is what's known as an order block, which is an area where institutional buy orders are congregated. Order blocks are formed when large institutions want to establish a long position in a stock, but lack the liquidity to do so. To get around this, they first initiate a small short position, driving the stock price down, triggering stop losses. They then take the opposite side of those stop loss orders, establishing their substantially larger long position. During the 2020 bull run, the institutions were making huge profits on their long positions, but were losing money on their short position. Thus, the institutions took profit on their long positions, driving the price of ARKK back down to where they first initiated their short position to close their short position for either a tiny loss or no loss at all. Now that the institutions have likely closed out all of their short positions, there is nothing left to stop ARKK from going up. This almost perfectly coincides with inflation peaking and the eventual Fed rate hike pause. For those who didn't buy during the 2020 mania and only began accumulating in the recent 1-2 years, congratulations on your future well-deserved profits. Price target is $84.65 in the next 1-2 years.

Is this area beween 32-35 a buy for ARKK if you are already in the stock.  If you are already own ARKK and bought it in tripple digits (ouch), is this the time to avg down.  I understand that avg down shouldnt be just to avg down a holding if its a bad stock.

x4346h_ARKK,ARKK,Cathie Wood’s ARKK Sees Biggest Monthly Outflow in Nearly a Year," Cracks are beginning to form in the resiliency of Ark Invest's retail-driven shareholder base, as its flagship fund suffers its biggest outflow in nearly a year.

The Ark Invest Disruptive Innovation ETF saw outflows of $820 million in August, just shy of its September 2021 outflow of $939 million, according to data from VettaFi.

The about-face could mark the beginning of a reversal of a more than year-long trend in which Ark saw positive inflows from its investors despite flagging performance. Year-to-date, the flagship ETF has seen about $1 billion in inflows.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has chalked up the resiliency of her investor base to Ark's practice of being transparent with its investment research and long-term views.

""Ark is net inflowing this year, and I think it's because we give away our research, and our research is unique. It's original research. And we're trying to help people understand how the world is going to change during the next five to 10 years, and how rapidly it's going to change,"" she said in a video update earlier this year.

But now investors may be growing tired of the consistent underperformance in the once-hot thematic ETF. Since its peak in February 2021, Ark's flagship fund has lost 75%, as a series of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and elevated inflation concerns put a big dent in longer-duration stocks that are not yet profitable.

Ark's flagship fund has lost 56% year-to-date, more than double the Nasdaq 100's decline of 25% over the same time period. Of the 36 holdings in Ark's flagship ETF, only two have generated a positive return over the past year: Tesla and Signify Health, according to data.

Meanwhile, a handful of stocks in Ark's portfolio are down upwards of 90% over the past year, including Berkeley Lights and Invitae Corporation, and Ark isn't afraid of buying the dip in its losing stocks.

Adding to Ark's underperformance has been its steadfast commitment to increasing its exposure to fledging tech stocks that saw a boom during the peak work-from-home era, with Zoom Video and Roku being its two largest holdings. Meanwhile, the fund has been building sizable positions in unproven biotech firms Ginkgo Bioworks and Beam Therapeutics, among others.

But despite the recent outflows and poor performance, Ark Invest still commands a sizable investment base relative to other thematic ETF providers. Ark's flagship fund has $8 billion in assets under management, a considerable amount despite its sizable fall from a peak of about $28 billion in early 2021.

As the title states, I have around 6k in a few ARKK funds, down roughly 68% in total. My initial plan was just to hold onto it for now, because how really much lower can it all go. TSLA being so down is not helping them out at all at this point.

This has to be somewhere near the bottom I believe for ARKK, and selling all it now seems like the worst thing someone could do being at the bottom but is it worth it to get out and put the rest in a VTI or a VOO, or even just TSLA? 

I was going to wait on some upward momentum then get out at the down 40%  range, thinking that wouldn't be that much to ask for.

I know it's easy to hate on ARKK now when they are so down, but it's funny because, when I bought in a couple years ago, most post on here were buy ARKK and stating Cathie as a genius. Now it is the complete opposite.

tbx1zy_ARKK,ARKK,Cathie Wood’s ARKK Lures Almost $1 Billion Even as ETF Sells Off,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund is down almost 40% this year. Some investors, though, are piling in -- wary of missing out on potential gains should the tide turn in its favor. 

The $11 billion ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) is on track to see its fifth straight week of inflows totaling roughly $1.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Traders have added money to the fund for three consecutive months now, the longest such streak in a year, with a net intake of $965 million for 2022 so far.

That’s happening as Wood’s growth-centric ETF gets hit on multiple fronts. The Federal Reserve is commencing a rate-hiking cycle, while the war in Ukraine pushes up commodity prices, leading to concerns that economic growth and corporate profits could slow. 

But for some investors, “it’s opportunistic investing,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “Maybe it’s an opportunity to rebalance and buy some of these big-name, good companies that have been in this correction and the prices are cheaper.”

The S&P 500 is on pace to notch its second consecutive week lower, but retail traders haven’t been deterred by the volatility. They’ve become a reliable support pillar for the market, plowing cash toward stocks for nine straight weeks. Partly, it’s a habit developed during the Covid-19 crash -- and one that’s proving stickier than many expected. Back then, buying during the March lows proved very profitable, including for ARKK enthusiasts. 

Gaffney says there’s a swath of investors who are wary of missing out on any other potential big run-ups in prices. “You always get some people who feel like, ‘I missed out on the last big run, and I’m not going to miss that again, so I’m going to get in now when prices are cheap.’”

Wood is famous for making bets on high-growth disruptive firms in areas like biotech and clean energy. Her flagship fund rose roughly 150% in 2020, with Tesla Inc. -- one of her favored plays -- gaining 740% that year. But those types of companies are suffering a reversal of fortunes this year. 

ARKK peaked last February and is down 60% since then. It has only spent a third of the year in the green so far. 

But the broader tech-trade selloff has become over-extended as investors bailed amid prospects for higher rates, according to Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.

“That being as oversold as it was certainly would be a place where you could find people who sift through the wreckage and say, ‘I can, with a modicum of comfort, say that these things are overdone. Enough damage has been done,’” he said by phone. “That probably is what drives some of the interest of late.”

Wood has stuck to her thesis even amid the slump, though she had a rare moment of compunction earlier this month when she admitted that her 2020 prediction for oil prices at $12 was “wrong.” 

And though ARKK has seen inflows this year, Wood’s other funds have suffered outflows, with the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) seeing withdrawals of $143 million this year, and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) losing more than $435 million. 

“The challenge is obviously she takes a very long-term view, and what that looks like is trying to be predictive of things that are many years in the future -- and this environment is one that is actually devastating to that,” said Eric Leve, chief investment officer at Bailard. “Higher interest rates are just crushing high growth, especially smaller and mid-cap high-growth companies whose earnings prospects remain far in the future.”

t3pzhh_ARKK,ARKK,$ARKK is on a run; up 16% since the low of Feb 23," I'm betting on an $ARKK comeback, after the massive selloff it has seen over the past several months.

1. Tech stocks were oversold, as were finTech stocks.
2. Capital will be fleeing markets in Russia and Ukraine, looking for a safe harbor in the USA.
3. Given the disruption to global economics due to the war, the Fed is less likely to *dramatically* raise borrowing costs, which is very helpful to the outlook of our highly leveraged tech growth sector.  Dramatically increased borrowing costs were priced in for these highly leveraged companies, and now that outlook is tempered.
4. ARKK invests heavily in FinTech and Pharmaceutical companies (outside of their largest holdings in $TSLA) and is *relatively* insulated from supply chain shocks caused by the war.

I'm just piling into $ARKK stock.  Hoping to see it return to the supports in the low $90s that it had in December. I bought in at $63, and it is up to $70 today.  

**MY POSITION:**  39 shares OF $ARKK @ a cost of $2,525 (been accumulating shares as I become more confident) and one long call dated March 18 with a strike of $74.",2022-02-28,49,91

Many media outlets and retail traders have turned completely against her funds but one man's trash *may* be another man's treasure. Look at the daily chart for the past year, we just logged a bullish reversal at around 63.12 key support level and is grossly oversold with an impressive DMI trend change indication for your technical heads out there. Many of the stocks in this fund are down 60%+ in the past 6 months and are likely to head back up and retrace 33%-66.7% of their recent falls.

There are a lot of trashy companies in this ETF mixed with some real future game changers. But odds favor a return to 80.88 resistance. I would only like it there before it likely returns for another attempt at 63.12 lows. After the next attempt at lows it frankly looks great for the long term positions, and I mean long term 5+yrs for a 150%+ return.

This is lining up to be a perfect technical, fundamental and crazy Elon tweet storm of bearishness for $ARKK.

Looking at the chart $ARKK has not joined in the most recent 'everything rally'. It's not near new highs and is at some technical resistance.

It's largest holding is $TSLA which has been on a screamer and to me looks blow off toppy. It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.

I think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.

The question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?

I am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:

**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**

I believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable. I did think about changing the strike date to Feb to avoid a possible Santa Claus rally, but then again if I think my timing is right then Jan should be fine.",2021-11-07,27,48

ntz1fd_ARKK,ARKK,"Cleanest + Repeated Options Flow Plays Series # 3 - AMC, CLNE, FUBO, ARKK. FB, FUTU, JMIA","Back with some great plays for everyone. Started [this series about 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/npjj9c/cleanest_options_flow_from_last_week_great_setups/) in another subreddit and many of the plays have been working extremely well e.g $ZM puts, $ARKK puts, $PAGS calls, $ABNB calls, and a lot more. You can check the previous plays by going to my profile.

Many of these plays are quite short term which is why I'm posting this in this subreddit.

# What is ""Clean + Repeated Flow""?

Any stock where the options flow has a single out of the money contract that dominates the overall flow has what I call ""clean + repeated"" options flow. The flow has to be all ""buys"" with large amounts of premiums being spent on it.

The reason for having this criteria is to find plays where other smart people are expecting the price to increase or decrease significantly, hence the OTM plays only.

Let's go.

# AMC

Let's start with the most famous stock last week with billions of dollars spent on it.  Although this is extremely high risk, there are tons of contracts towards 60-80 strikes for the next 1-2 weeks.  High risk but a lot of possible reward as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ur9lid7ngq371.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3137d3c7796a2a9f43001c28f0a553faf9c4f62

# CLNE

Clean flow here, no puts at all on Friday. Expecting the price to increase by a few dollars by the next few weeks.  Play here is September 17, 13 strike calls.

https://preview.redd.it/te1ouznngq371.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b68bfc3f545df91ba12f12744113ee7b5f7d37

# FUBO

Again, clean flow here towards 28 strike with one trade for the 40 strike.  I like the fact that the sold call was for 28 strike which means that might be the minimum we go next week.  **Play here are 40 calls for 11 November 2021.**

https://preview.redd.it/6hf1za6ogq371.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&s=597dbdd0666f585b85ccf76df784e2ab5b06b249

# ARKK

Plenty of puts flow keeps on coming. Growth stocks are making good moves, so these might be hedged positions, but the flow remains bearish on ARKK. Not super high confidence, but it can act as a hedge if it doesn't work out. **Play here is 107 puts for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/sxmofaoogq371.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c2ec8dc9fe45cb5f41e4761ff0b844cfe094e93

# FB

Heavy short term bullish flow here. I'd expect the price to keep increasing throughout the week.  **Play here is 345 calls for July 16th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zp78ts6pgq371.png?width=2117&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cb8824b4ddbaf040bf40fc25b7cfbc3194bb850

# FUTU

Lots of call buying going on here for the 155 strike. We caught this on Friday, and it has already panned out a bit, but there might still be money to be made here.  **Play  here would be 155 calls for July.**

https://preview.redd.it/iwdns6ppgq371.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fe38aa71bbfce5b6f07879aefeba8f151f7ac61

# JMIA

Someone was very confident in a price increase here. Plenty of orders filled above ask for the 33 strike here.  **Play here is 33 strike for July 16th or June 18th.**

https://preview.redd.it/zzc7cleqgq371.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&s=849fd8cb047598180678fe43576536d14353707a

npjq8q_CRWD,CRWD,"Cleanest Options Flow from Last Week - Setups going into Next Week - QQQ, CRWD, ARKK, PAGS, ZM, ABNB","I built a bot a couple of weeks ago  that looks at the live options flow all day and finds heavy repeated  flow where a lot of money is being spent. This type of flow can predict  future price activity especially if the contracts are out of the money.  Based on this principle, here are some great plays with cleanest options  flow from this week.

All of these are potential plays that I'll be playing in the next few weeks. Hope folks will find these beneficial both for day trading and swing trading. 

Let's start with **$ZM.**  There were a bunch of puts bought towards 330 and a put bought above  ask for 250 all expiring in the next few months.  There was some  interesting call flow towards 400 but very little.  Play here is 330  puts for July/August.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oqr1ef67gk271.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=3680ab75188b7c39d1acb37dea5d101f15e9e9e2

**$PAGS** this was my favorite flow that we caught last week. There were tons of 50 calls and a lot of money was being spent on them.  The stock has already gone from 45 to 49 based on the flow we caught. But there seems to be more upside.  Plays is 52.5 September Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1v2c34w9gk271.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c52ecbcbba9cfce0f1de000b212f105935b2e9

**$ABNB** another excellent setup here. There are a few puts here but quite a lot of calls towards 140-150. Clean flow!  The play here is 140-150 calls for August/September.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iraf5tlagk271.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=957850c17a84c0beb5f553b75e4c226980d13b4a

**$CRWD** I believe we have earnings here this week. Risk setup but there's abundant flow towards 230-235 calls.  Play here is to just follow smart money. June 235 calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4c1dg24bgk271.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7ced6e73c42114770e42f796bba8e363a1ba56

**$ARKK** some heavy puts here + reveral after touching the 50 moving average. We are still in a downtrend so this can also be an excellent hedge play if you are into growth stocks.  Play here is 90-100 puts 2 months out.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zc5zxpbgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&s=89a75abac961d937daeee3d0fe4c6d7fa0e20d0a

**$QQQ** this is a lotto play but there are tons of heavy puts on QQQ last week. I'd buy a few puts far out of the money both as a hedge and as a lotto.  Play here 315 puts for July 16.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oyohc7cgk271.png?width=2242&format=png&auto=webp&s=f966f2f5d24580c962389f5b54edc6982b6a0e91

**$UBER** final one here. Heavy calls towards 55 strike + clean flow.   Play here is 55 strikes for August 20. Follow the expiration here! Don't go short term.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p0ozdducgk271.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e9c24ef143ff0f505574901d56c0df621e31b93

That's it. Please always do your own DD along with these plays for the best results. Options flow should always be coupled with price action analysis to find the best plays. Also, let me know if this is something the community likes. I can post these every week.

What do you guys think? Too early to say MOON will win over ARKK in the long term? 

Ps: since I am based in EU, I can't buy either of these etfs. However, arkk has inspired me to buy into baidu and tdoc is my biggest holding (bought before I heard of Arkk). Regarding Moon, only company i own that overlaps with the moon holdings is plug (but not as individual holding, but through IQQH).

Looking to get some feedback here on a LEAP play for ARKK as the ETF is still a ways off of its ATH and current LEAPS could pay double to triple the expected return from holding the stock. Yes I eat crayons and looked at the possible pay out on options profit calculator lol

The IV is in the 92% percentile rank so it’s IV was lower 92% of the time last year (makes sense given the massive sell off recently). 

However, looking at the Jan 22 $100 call could pay off incredibly well even if this ETF hits its ATH again in a year from now (double the return on the leap compared to gains from holding the stock).

lz11co_ARKK,ARKK,Question for people invested in ARK funds. Specifically ARKK.,"As everyone knows, tech/growth/speculative stocks are currently seeing correction from the insane run up we've had this past year. What slightly bothers me about this run up is the past performance of the ARK fund prior to this run up. The growth was so slow and steady, absolutely nothing like the returns we'd seen in 2020. 

&#x200B;

So my question to you guys.. how much of this growth do you think came in the form of actual growth from the companies themselves rather than cheap interest rates/deep discounted cashflows/cheap borrowing? 

&#x200B;

Between 2015 - 2020, ARKK grew around 100%. Between 2020-2021, its grown 300%, so to me that doesn't feel very sustainable and in some ways i'm trying to use this as a proxy to 'predict the bottom' (I know I know, nobody can predict the bottom), but surely based on this fact alone it allows us to at least guess a bit more accurately?",2021-03-06,15,29

lv1sjx_NET,NET,Investors beware: $ARKK is a liquidity disaster waiting to happen,"I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.

Lately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.

In the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?

We'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

I ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.

***Correlation of 70%***

***R-squared of 0.49*** 

That is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.

What happens next?

Last week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.

The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.

As someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.

After spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.

As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.

Good luck and I hope I am wrong.

***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.

In any case, here goes...

Background on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a ""roll forward"" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.

In this case:

A:   Beginning of period AUM        <--- Sourced from Simfund

B:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   <--- Sourced from Simfund

C:   +/- Market Performance        <--- Implied by D less B less A

D:   End of Period AUM                <--- Sourced from Simfund


In this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.

I think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.

***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.

***Edit*** - An interesting easter egg in Ark's daily email update and associated disclosures. Quoting from the thread linked below.

On Friday, February 26, ARK expanded its daily trade email disclaimer to 718 words compared to 163 words on Thursday, February 25.

Two new disclaimers:

""Additional risks of investing in ARK ETFs include market, management, concentration and non-diversification risks""

""There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue..”

lv1sjx_SQ,SQ,Investors beware: $ARKK is a liquidity disaster waiting to happen,"I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.

Lately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.

In the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?

We'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

I ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.

***Correlation of 70%***

***R-squared of 0.49*** 

That is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.

What happens next?

Last week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.

The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.

As someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.

After spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.

As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.

Good luck and I hope I am wrong.

After a stratospheric year, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is ready to take it a step further: Into gourds.

The New York-based firm is planning to launch the ARK Agricultural Exploration ETF (ticker ARKZ), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed exchange-traded fund will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in gourd harvesting, and related agricultural commodities. 

After massive inflows over the past year, the once-niche firm now oversees about $41.5 billion in ETF products, compared with less than $3.5 billion in the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ark recently became a [top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/cathie-wood-s-ark-joins-top-10-etf-giants-with-tesla-heavy-fund)\-10 ETF issuer, thanks in large part to its $21.6 billion flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that has [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) as its biggest holding. While the vast majority of ETFs passively track indexes of stocks, Ark offers five actively managed U.S. ETFs, and Wood runs all of them.

After the close of regular trading, [Deere & Company](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DE:US) soared -0.14%, while gourd futures skyrocketed on additional news that r/wallstreetbets user u/TheEmperorOfJenks was to be appointed Managing Director of the new fund.",2021-01-19,1467,98

I’ve seen a lot of discussion about these two specific ETF funds and I like the idea of having a portfolio that isn’t super up and down. I’ve been looking into investing into either ARKG or ARKK (yes I know getting both is an option) and my current portfolio consists of RCEY, Nio, CRSR, SPCE, APHA, UXIN. Can someone break down the pros and cons between these two ETFs and which would be more coverage for my portfolio? I’m leaning towards ARKK because it seems like it’s investing in companies that I’m at least somewhat familiar with. Just wanted your guys overall thoughts on these two stocks.",2020-12-22,4,26
kfavo1_SQ,SQ,ARKK 18 Jun 21 120 C being miss priced.,I bought these with the intention of a poor mans TSLA play with a ROKU and SQ kicker but have been learning a  hard lesson. Over the last 3 trading sessions the ETF has gone from 121.83 to 126.07 while at the same time the contract I have has lost 30% of its value. Frustrated I call TD and all they can say is it is worth what someone will pay for it. So greeks be damned? IV doesn't matter? Needless to say that answer does not work for me and I hoped this sub would have an actual answer.,2020-12-18,16,53

k8vgap_ARKK,ARKK,DEEP ITM LEAP calls on ARKK,I'm planning to do my first deep itm leap call on an ETF. I choose Arkk cause im bullish on this etf. I own 46 shares and made some nice returns on it. I'm thinking about buying the Jan. 2022 $75c with a delta of .85. I also plan on selling calls against my leap (poor man's covered call). My concern is will I have enough liquidity to close my contract if I need to? and what if my sell calls strike is ITM by expiration? any input is greatly appreciated thank you.,2020-12-08,32,39
k8xtl3_ARKK,ARKK,Thoughts on investing everything into actively managed ETFs? (ARKK),"Hey guys,

I’ve have a position in ARKK, and the more I’ve learned about it and listened to Cathie, the more I feel it will beat a passive equity index over the long term. 

The way I’ve heard it put is that, investing in all-in-one ETFs is like investing in the past, in what’s worked, whereas investing in disruptive innovation is predicting what the future will be, and working back from there. 

What are the worst case scenarios for putting everything into one investment company?

Is there a moral argument for investing in innovative companies rather than in broad market indices?

Those are a couple things I’m wondering about. Let me know your thoughts and if you disagree with anything.",2020-12-08,20,20

io39rb_ARKK,ARKK,"Are ARKK, ARKQ and ARKW worth investing for a long term considering their exposure to TSLA?","I recently invested a small amount in the ARKK, ARKQ and ARKW funds. I was always skeptical of their exposure to TSLA. It has benefited those funds recently, but their TSLA holding seems like a poison pill to me. Not sure what they would do with TSLA and how TSLA itself would perform in future.

I am more interested in investing potential growth stories and am not keen specifically on TSLA. I am also looking for long-term. Are these ARK funds good to invest in? Are there other alternatives?

ifa049_ARKK,ARKK,The market doesn’t account for unexpected innovation. Which is why ARKK is currently the best ETF today.,"Something I noticed, when Amazon released AWS the value of the stock began increasing ten fold. 

When Tesla released the cybertruck, and announced battery day the stock shot up ten fold. 

When Square announced a new addition to their ecosystem such as using ML to take out loans and opening a real bank, the stock also increased tremendously. 


It seems that investing in good vertically integrated companies, with great CEOs, that have shown a history of being able to suddenly announce unexpected innovations will end up giving 10-100x returns. Which is what TSLA, AMZN and SQ are currently doing. Which is what AAPL used to do under Steve Jobs.
