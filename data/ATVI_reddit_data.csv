1kh1tsc_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft wins FTC appeal challenging $69 bln Activision Blizzard deal,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected a legal challenge by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69 billion purchase of “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower judge's order that said the FTC was not entitled to a preliminary injunction blocking the deal, which closed in 2023.

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.",2023-05-15,2228,302

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

By all accounts and market professionals, the CMA is the last major hurdle and is likely to approve. The buyout will likely close in June at the $95 merger price. The EU is unlikely to block, and the FTC has no case and will lose in court if they go for a preliminary injunction. 

So, if the CMA approves by Wed, the deal is almost guaranteed to close. The stock is currently at $85.53. What do you guys think about $92 calls expiring this Friday the 28th? New Zealand is also due to announce their decision on Friday, but that likely will have little bearing on the stock price.

12mxbsi_ATVI,ATVI,Long dated options after acquisitions do not expire worthless. ATVI covered calls are risky,"I’ve been researching what happens to long dated options after an acquisition. Apparently the fate of options depend on the acquisition terms. There was recently a post about selling covered calls on ATVI. This is a good way to ruin your life. 

The fate of non-expired ITM options is completely unclear. Therefore if you sell covered calls on ATVI at $95 (this is the buyout price) you are exposing yourself to unknown risks. People seemed to be under the impression that the calls will expire worthless and they can keep the premium. 

One common adjustment is a change in the terms of the option contract, such as a change in the strike price or the number of shares underlying the option. This is done to reflect the change in the value of the underlying asset due to the acquisition.

In some cases, the acquiring company may also choose to buy back outstanding call options at a premium to their current market value in order to avoid the potential for large payouts to option holders. 

How can the calls expire worthless if they’re no where near the expiration date? Clearly this is more complicated than you thought. Unless you’ve read through the terms of the acquisition, you are completely unprepared for the risks that may occur.",2023-04-15,0,10

But sources say at least one of the four-member panel’s three Democratic commissioners — which in addition to Khan include Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya — also has recently appeared to lean toward the Microsoft camp, according to a source close to the situation.

A Democratic defection would leave Khan with a 2-2 tie in any vote to clamp down on the merger — a result that would not only effectively OK the deal but also throw Khan’s authority over the agency into question. That, accordingly, is a vote that Khan isn’t likely to risk, according to DC insiders.

“Lina would probably not put things in a position for that to take place, so instead of having that vote she would make the motion to approve the settlement,” said William Kovacic, a former FTC Chairman. “The way out is to say, ‘We got a great deal and only got it because we’ve been badasses.'”

Activision has been trading near 52 week high of $86 for most of the last year with hopes of Microsoft acquiring the company. 

> **Microsoft transaction**

> As announced on January 18, 2022, Microsoft plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share in an all-cash
transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of regulatory review. The
transaction, which is expected to close in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, has been approved by the boards
of directors of both Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and by Activision Blizzard’s stockholders


There has been a lot of drama about it and the deal seems to be on hold indefinitely... until EU decides that it's kosher. 

[EU opens investigation into Microsoft, Activision Blizzard merger](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/11/08/eu-microsoft-activision-acquisition-call-of-duty/)


Recently though there has been some worrying news involving Activision. 

[Activision Blizzard games to go offline in China after NetEase deal falls through](https://www.ft.com/content/2d3a2351-8c19-4e11-bf16-54d05a668840)


> China is the world’s largest gaming market, but foreign developers need a local partner to distribute their games in the country. Beijing also heavily censors gaming content and controls the number of new releases through a licensing system.

> Activision Blizzard said on Thursday it was unable to reach a deal to renew a licensing agreement with NetEase, one of China’s largest game developers and publishers, which has distributed the games in the country for years.

> The California-based company said last week that the NetEase agreement in dispute accounted for about 3 per cent of its net revenues last year, translating to roughly $264mn in sales.


[Google agreed to pay $360 mln to Activision to stop competition, Epic Games alleges](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-agreed-pay-360-mln-activision-stop-competition-epic-games-alleges-2022-11-17/)

[Here is the latest earning report](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/67c7ad10-e540-4152-a3e4-5323b329920a)


> For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, Activision Blizzard’s net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were
$1.78 billion, as compared with $2.07 billion for the third quarter of 2021. GAAP net revenues from digital channels were
$1.61 billion. GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.55, as compared with $0.82 for
the third quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, Activision Blizzard’s operating margin was 34% and earnings per diluted
share was $0.68, as compared with $0.89 for the third quarter of 2021.
Activision Blizzard generated $257 million in operating cash flow for the quarter as compared with $521 million for the
third quarter of 2021.


Stock is trading at its current price just with hopes of the Microsoft deal, which to me seems be getting more and more unlikely.


With relatively poor performance and a shrinking market, Blizzard may well drop down to its 52 week low of $56 or even lower. 


You decide if it's worth gambling.

&#x200B;

**Prior edition:**  

*  [Q1 '22 Earnings Call Takeaways for video game publishers: (ATVI, EA, TTWO) : stocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzeoht/q1_22_earnings_call_takeaways_for_video_game/) 

&#x200B;

**CY Q2 '22 Bookings vs the prior quarter:**

* ATVI: $1,637m (*down $284m or 14.8%*)
   * Bookings were down primarily due to Activision (-*$299m or -37.9%)* 
   * Decrease is primarily due to Call of Duty

&#x200B;

* EA: $1,299m (*down $37m or 2.8%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*down $117m or 41.5%; this is primarily due to last year including releases for Mass Effect Remaster and It Takes Two without a comparable release during the current quarter*)
   * Live Services (*up $80m or 7.6%; primarily due to Apex Legends, acquisitions, and FIFA*)

&#x200B;

* TTWO: $1,103m (*up $391m or 49.1%*)
   * The increase is primarily due to the recent Zynga acquisition, NBA, and WWE
   * Excluding Zynga, TTWO's bookings would have been $731m or up 3% y/y

&#x200B;

* General Takeaways:
   * ATVI continues to struggle due to lower engagement with Call of Duty
   * EA & TTWO results were within expectations 

&#x200B;

**Full Year Bookings Guidance vs prior guidance:**

* ATVI: N/A
   * No guidance available since they're about to be acquired by Microsoft

&#x200B;

* EA: $7,900m - $8,100m (*no change*)
   * No change in prior guidance since EA Sports outperforming will offset headwinds from a weaker mobile market and strengthening U.S. dollar

&#x200B;

* TTWO: $5,800m - $5,900m (*up $2,050m or 53.2% - 54.7%*)
   * Increase is primarily due to the recent Zynga acquisition
   * Focusing on 2K & Rockstar to exclude the noise from acquisitions & smaller parts of the business, guidance is $3,132m - $3,186m. That's down $243m - $279m or 7.2% - 8.1%.
   * That's assuming mobile & Private Division accounted for 10% of the prior guidance and 46% of the current guidance

&#x200B;

* General Takeaways:
   * ATVI gives no guidance, but it's irrelevant since they're about to be acquired. I also expect results to improve with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Overwatch II
   * EA did not change their guidance showing that the business is still performing well
   * TTWO was able to show more details about how the business will look with Zynga, but guidance xZynga was weaker due to game delays and some weakness for GTA

&#x200B;

**Latest Price Targets after updating my forecasts:**

* ATVI: $95
   * Based on Microsoft's acquisition price

&#x200B;

* EA: $130 - $132
   * 15x multiple on FY '23 EBITDA of $2,400m - $2,445m
   * This is aligned with EA's guidance
   * I previously gave the stock a 20x multiple, but valuations are decreasing across the stock market and they have an unusually high amount of EBITDA adjustments this year given their acquisitions. As a result, I lowered my assigned multiple by 5pp.
   * I expect the company to be sold this year or in 2023 based on recent reports that EA is trying to sell itself to big tech. More details: [Report: EA Was Deep In Merger Talks With NBCUniversal (kotaku.com)](https://kotaku.com/ea-acquisition-apex-legends-star-wars-fifa-nbcuniversal-1848957274)
   * A 20x multiple on the same FY '23 EBITDA forecast suggests a $173 - $176 price target

&#x200B;

* TTWO: $114 - $120
   * 20x multiple of FY '23 EBITDA of $1,060m - $1,109m
   * This is aligned with TTWO's guidance
   * I previously gave the stock a 25x multiple, but valuations are decreasing across the stock market and they have an unusually high amount of EBITDA adjustments this year given their Zynga acquisition. As a result, I lowered my assigned multiple by 5pp,
   * Could earn a higher multiple in the future since it's the largest metaverse company on earth that the stock market isn't fully appreciating, Zynga integration upside in 1 -2 years, GTA 6 upside in 3 - 5 years, & could be an attractive acquisition target for big tech that want a top player in gaming & metaverse with a digestible market cap (*only $21 billion*)

Berkshire seems to want to take advantage of this situation and acquired almost a billion worth of Activision. Why wouldn't Microsoft itself do that?,2022-05-10,69,20

ue0jle_ATVI,ATVI,Activision/ATVI shareholders approve Microsoft buyout - looking like solid value,"Solid play on this, around 77 bucks on a microsoft purchase price of 95 and clearing the hurdle of the vote today.

Of course this still requires regulatory approval in the US and Europe but fears on this are overblown imo, it's hard to argue exactly how this transaction provides Microsoft any real monopolistic power. Because.. it doesn't. Not nearly enough to block this. Remember, they want to be tough on tech monopolozation, failing to block a dicey transaction isn't a good look. They'll want to keep their powder dry, albeit with some potential Sabre rattling.

Over 23% to be gained, to my mind finalization of the deal is when, not if. They're still claiming before mid 2023, if so it's roughly 20% p.a. return worst case, then it's a solid play. You can boost returns on an option play but end of 23 options are pricing a lot of additional gain out.

Attractiveness increases when you look at the broader background - as Fed/most of the globe lifts rates (with pricing continuing to tick up here), growth stocks will continue to be pressured, most stocks will be.. like I said, solid play with solid names in my opinion.

Bottom line first: Do you think the ATVI MAR23 +1*90/-2*95/1*100 properly reflects the chance that the MSFT cash acquisition goes through?

So recently MSFT has decided to add ATVI in their [mad quest to buy everything](https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/). Currently ATVI trades at a ~16.89% discount to the proposed acq cash price. The part that confuses me is that the butterfly around the 95 strike reflects almost a 5-1 payout if closing on acq price. The crux of my Q is if the discount to Acq and prob of the butterfly line up, or if there is research related to that topic?

Could there be a strategy to enter the MAR2023 butterfly and short equivalent delta to build a pure “odds acq might proceed” play? Vol should be seen as “lower” since an acq is possible, but should the ATVI MAR23 +1*90/-2*95/1*100 reflect such a low vol? Not too concerned w/ negative carry since the play would be asymmetrical.

s8harn_ATVI,ATVI,Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts,"**Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts**

*Originally posted on my* [blog](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2022/01/19/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-thoughts/)*. Disclosure: I am long Activision Blizzard and Microsoft.*

Big news in the gaming world. Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion (net of cash $68b), or $95 per share . This is the largest gaming industry acquisition ever, which crushed the previous record established last week when Take Two bought Zynga for $11 billion. The deal is also Microsoft’s biggest ever.

Microsoft offered a 45% premium. This is a hefty premium compared to where ATVI traded in recent months, but ATVI traded at higher prices one year ago (52-week high $104). The recent scandals have hurt ATVI.

At the moment, ATVI trades \~$82 per share. This implies that the market is skeptical that the deal will close. There’s an arbitrage opportunity here. If the deal goes through, it offers a 16% upside. ATVI also distributes a small dividend once a year. Let’s discuss this arbitrage opportunity. .

Disclosure: I am long ATVI and Microsoft. I’ve been a shareholder of both companies before the announcement. I’m pleased with the offer. I’m biased. I don’t see the risk the market does and that’s the issue. It’s not the capacity to pay. Microsoft has the cash and won’t dilute shareholders. So it sounds like possible antitrust issues. Is there anything else I’m missing?

Here’s a brief background on both companies:

**Activision Blizzard**

It’s no secret that the company behind blockbuster games like Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo is going through a rough patch, to say the least. I’m not going to rehash everything that happened (years of sexual harassment, discrimination, and misconduct). But what happened and how it was handled is business/PR 101 on what not to do.

ATVI’s reputation is damaged. Talent is leaving. There’s probably more skeletons in the closet. Bobby Kotick built a great company, great games, and rewarded shareholders very well along the way. But Kotick mismanaged the crisis and lost the trust of the gamers, public, employees, and the market. We don’t have the full story. I suspect more internal problems, more culture and development issues with games. And it’s not just the scandal, ATVI has made some missteps in the past.

The thing is the scandal would have followed the company for a long time. These things don’t go away easily. The media and the Internet will keep bringing up. And if you underperform operationally, game quality and growth is affected, the pressure will just keep going up. Your culture might be so tainted that gamers don’t want to be associated with your games. A crisis like that would have taken years to fix and in the process possibly lose your competitiveness and sales. Who knows if the stock would ever recover.

With this background, I understand why ATVI accepted the $95 cash offer. It’s probably better that ATVI is under a different home. Fix the issues away from the public. It’s been reported that Kotick will leave if and once the deal closes. In a sense it gives him a graceful exit.

**Microsoft**

Microsoft has been making a lot of deals lately. WSJ reported that MSFT had long been interested in ATVI and had discussed a potential acquisition in the past.

If you are going to spend $75 billion for a business, you have big plans. It’s also telling of their gaming ambitions. For the last ten years MSFT has been boosting their gaming portfolio.

For the last ten years Microsoft has been boosting their gaming assets. Microsoft has been working on building the “Netflix” of gaming. A subscription based cloud gaming service. Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows people to stream games via nearly any internet-connected device (issue is that game requires a lot of data to run smoothly). And because Microsoft owns Azure, they have the cloud infrastructure to support such a strategy.

The strategy is to persuade gamers to abandon their expensive hardware and play on the cloud. If Microsoft could convert some of Activision’s close to 400 million monthly active users into subscribers, it could significantly bolster its cloud-game business.

**Issues**

I believe it comes down to antitrust. But because I’m set to benefit I don’t fully see the risk the market does. John Hempton from Bronte Capital brought up some of the same issues on a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_Hempton/status/1483540883333324802). But I don’t see anything substantial in the Twitter comments. I share some of his views. Here’s what I think and please let me know what I don’t see:

* Is there a precedent where the Gov/Justice Department/FTC blocked a gaming transaction?
* The deal is not expected to close for a while (ATVI Fiscal 2023) but that is still a big gap.
* I think the #1 factor is Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC. She’s been very vocal about taking on big tech. She’s writing papers about. That’s why she got the job. The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor is not Microsoft’s ally.
* This deal poses an important test of the Biden Administration’s generally unfriendly view of large technology acquisitions.
* However, from a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other big tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google).
* Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t go through. This indicates to me that they are confident the deal will go through.
* The games will need to be on multiple platforms (Playstation, PC, Nintendo, mobile etc…). If not it’s a deal breaker. The deal won’t get approved and you will get a gamer mutiny. And gamers are crazy.
* Keeping the games multi-platform also makes business sense. If you fence off Call of Duty to only Xbox, you will kill part of the gamer community and hurt the branding. If you pay $75b you want to see some returns at the end of the day.
* If these get hairy they might have to sell a couple titles.
* I don’t think there’s too much concentration. In terms of gaming sales (excluding hardware) Microsoft is #4. Tencent, Sony and Apple have more gaming revenues. ATVI is #7. The deal will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company in terms of revenue.

I think the deal will go through. Let’s hear other views and why.

qpm163_ATVI,ATVI,Activision Blizzard $ATVI - Steep Discount,"Has anyone spent time taking a close look at this company? I’m especially curious if anyone particularly loves/hates this at $67/share

Activision is the company behind Call of Duty, Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, etc. I know they to have a very loyal customer following. 

Over the past 6 months, the stock has traded down approximately 30% from $100/share. Given a history of +5-10% revenue growth, and over $3.5/share of cash flow, this seems potentially quite attractive

Reasons for the sell-off that I can see: 1) Sexual harassment lawsuit and claims of unequal gender pay; 2) delays around Overwatch and Diablo IV making for a lengthier period before the next revenue growth acceleration 

$3.5 / $67 = +5% yield. Assuming no multiple expansion, 5-10% growth results in 10-15% IRRs on a multi year basis. 

In terms of multiples, the company has treaded 20-30x cash flow historically. If the multiple improves from its current ~20x, that’s incremental return from there

qovbv7_TTWO,TTWO,"Q3 '21 Earnings Call Takeaways for video game publishers: (ATVI, EA, TTWO)","I love video games as an investor & a gamer. Here's my ***unbiased view supported by data, research & facts*** of how each publisher did in the prior quarter & the outlook ahead:

&#x200B;

**Q3 '21 Bookings vs the prior quarter:**

* ATVI: $1,880m (*down $41m or 2.1%*)
   * Bookings were down primarily due to Activision console & PC (-*$152m or -24.2%; I believe this is due to churn to Apex Legends due to their lack of a solution for anti-cheating while ATVI believes it was due to last year's tough comps*) mostly offset by Blizzard (*$60m or 13.9%; they released Diablo*) and King (*$17m or 2.7%; Candy Crush & advertising*)
* EA: $1,851m (*up $515m or 38.5%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $414m or 146.8%; they released FIFA '22*)
   * Live Services (*up $101m or 9.6%; which I believe is primarily Apex Legends benefitting from WarZone churn*)
* TTWO: $985m (*up $273m or 38.4%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $85m or 38.4%; they released NBA 2K '22*)
   * Recurrent Consumer Spending *(up $189m or 38.4%, benefitted from GTA Los Santos Turner update & NBA 2K engagement*)
* General Takeaways:
   * Excluding new game releases, TTWO & EA were able to sequentially increase bookings from the prior quarter while ATVI did not.
   * ATVI is losing engagement for WarZone while EA & TTWO are doing well.

&#x200B;

**Full Year Bookings Outlook vs prior guidance:**

* ATVI: $8,650m (*unchanged*)
   * I believe there is some downside risk given World of Warcraft & Call of Duty may see continued gamer churn to New World, Apex, Legends, and Battlefield 2042.
* EA: $7,625m (*up $225m or 3.0%*)
   * That $225m was for Live Services only, which likely reflects Apex Legends taking share from WarZone.
   * I noticed they didn't change their expectations for Full Game Downloads including Battlefield 2042, which I'm bullish on given community engagement
* TTWO: $3,300m - $3,400m (*up $100m or 3.0%*)
   * Looks like NBA 2K & GTA engagement has been better-than-expected despite tough comps from last year's lockdowns & this year's reopening economy
* General Takeaways:
   * I don't trust ATVI's guidance for bad reasons (*CoD & WoW churn*)
   * I don't trust EA's guidance for good reasons (*the CEO mentioned BF 2042 early access event was the largest they ever had & feel very good about player demand, yet didn't bump Full Download guidance*)
   * TTWO is doing just fine

&#x200B;

**Latest Price Targets after updating my forecasts:**

* ATVI: $59
   * 10x multiple on FY EBITDA of $4,022m
   * That $4,022m is aligned with management's guidance, but giving a lower multiple due to near-team guidance miss from WoW & CoD churn, delaying OverWatch 2 & Diablo, and a penalty for poor management with workplace issues
   * If I bumped that multiple to 25x, my price target would be $137. But, I don't see the market giving that multiple anytime soon until the pipeline is back on track & there is more confidence in management.
   * Very undervalued for long-term investors that are patient for a turnaround if I bumped the multiple back up.
* EA: $167
   * 25x multiple on FY EBITDA of $1,915m
   * Upside from Battlefield 2042 and is my #1 conviction for the short-term
* TTWO: $225
   * 35x multiple of FY EBITDA of $728m
   * Higher multiple since it's the largest metaverse company on earth that the stock market isn't fully appreciating, GTA 6 upside in a few years, & could be an attractive acquisition target for big tech that want a top player in gaming & metaverse with a digestible market cap (*only $21 billion*)
   * My #1 conviction for the long-term due to metaverse & GTA 6",2021-11-07,21,6

Looks like one of those rare opportunities to snatch up a solid company for a heavy discount. Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Candy Crush, some of the biggest titles.

&#x200B;

**Activision Blizzard (ActiBlizz) - About the company**

Where does Activision Blizzard (ATVI) fit into all of this? ActiBlizz is one of the world’s most renowned triple A game developers. The company is divided into 3 separate publishers that consist of various studios and intellectual property: Activision, Blizzard, and King. Here’s where each of their IP fall under by publisher.

https://preview.redd.it/4o7omgg5har71.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=200fec65a1bd9bc848dbfe83f1d8032e0a91bce6

&#x200B;

ActiBlizz’s largest-grossing franchise is by far the Call of Duty IP, also known as CoD, that releases a new addition to the sequel every year in the fall. Coming in second is the King publisher with Candy Crush, and very close behind is the Blizzard segment that consists of games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthsone, Starcraft, etc. Here’s a chart that displays the percentage of revenue from each publisher. Activision is by far the largest source of revenue producing nearly 50%.

https://preview.redd.it/q28pqar5har71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=c371422b634c2edfe05b91564d0f402675458603

&#x200B;

**Gaming Market - CAGR and TAM**

Let’s look at the potential growth of the video game industry. A report by Cision, suggests that the video game market, which includes PC, console, and mobile gaming, will have an expected CAGR of 11% between 2021-2026. The total addressable market (TAM) of the gaming market, currently estimated at $175 billion, is forecasted to reach approximately 300 billion by 2027. Roughly half of this is attributed to mobile gaming, leaving the other half for PC and console.

&#x200B;

It’s not easy to put an exact number on ATVI’s current market share in this industry. Based on their TTM revenues of roughly \~8.3 billion and a current market size of $175 billion we can make a broad assumption that ATVI currently holds a 5% market share of the entire gaming industry. If all things remain equal a 5% share of the estimated 300 billion in 2027 would equate to 15 billion in revenue for ATVI, almost double what they are currently bringing in.

&#x200B;

**ActiBlizz - The Strategy & Pipeline**

The industry-wide data emphasizes mobile gaming market is out-pacing growth relative to PC and console. ATVI already owns the the most grossing mobile game of all time, Candy Crush, but they are also re-positioning themselves to take the lead into the advanced mobile gaming market. By advanced gaming market I am referring to games that aren’t the type for playing five minutes here and there. These games are the grab-and-go versions of popular console/PC IP, such as CoD mobile and the up-and-coming Diablo: Immortal, a hack-and-slash for smartphones.

&#x200B;

Activision hit it out of the park with CoD mobile and, as per their most recent earnings call, is on track to exceed $1 billion in consumer spending for the year. Remember this is a MOBILE game. On their recent earnings calls management commented on the strong growth in bookings:

>“Call of Duty Mobile net bookings grew double digits year over year and sequentially, driven by strong execution in seasonal content in the West and the recent launch of the game in China”

&#x200B;

ActiBlizz has successfully ported a CoD title to mobile and it is well-known that a Diablo title will be coming to mobile in early 2022. Management also recently hinted at a World of Warcraft (WoW) mobile title in the works.

>“Two Warcraft mobile experiences are in various stages of internal testing, with the team looking forward to sharing more about these titles soon”

&#x200B;

PC and console games will always remain a strong presence in the gaming industry, but as smartphones and tablets become increasingly powerful the door is wide open to take advantage of this growing market. ActiBlizz is well-positioned to dominate mobile gaming by introducing monetization tactics to capture freemium users (free to play, pay to buy premium in-game content) and transition them later on to their existing premium models on different consoles -creating a positive feedback loop. To do this, the company has been hiring talent and so far has added hundreds of developers to the roster even though they have lost a few of their top game designers (I will get into this later on).

>“We have added hundreds of developers to the franchise over the last three years, and we continue to grow our teams as we prepare to launch three unique and complementary experiences across platform”

&#x200B;

**Diablo II: Remastered - The Nostalgic Cash-Machine**

ATVI already has steady cash-flow from their on-going IP. Whether the latest CoD release has an average review of 9/10 or 6/10 it’s safe to say they will sell millions of copies regardless. The same can be said for updates to the Hearthstone and WoW franchises, this is already known and priced in. I want to forecast revenues from the expansion of the Diablo segment by looking at recently released Diablo 2: Remastered (D2R) game for PC and console.

&#x200B;

A quick history of the Diablo franchise. Back in the year 2000 Diablo II became one of the greatest games ever for that time period selling over 4 million copies as a PC-only game. Fourteen years later ActiBlizz released Diablo 3 for PC and console which ended up selling over 30 million (!) copies and becoming top 3 game in history, closely behind Minecraft in the number two spot, and PlayerUnknown Battleground as number one.

&#x200B;

Circling back to D2R which was released last weekend (Sept 23, 2021). Let’s look at a few trends for how anticipated this game was among the gaming community.

&#x200B;

First, I want to look at the estimated site traffic of the most well-known Diablo community for in-game trading, d2jsp

https://preview.redd.it/h5u9glx6har71.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=73fb68d1fc195c8e3eea03d864d5b443bd9eecd0

&#x200B;

Next, I’ll look at Reddit’s very own sub-reddit stats and look at the increase in subscribers and sub-reddit activity (comments) for the two most popular Diablo communities, r/Diablo and r/Diablo2.

https://preview.redd.it/dg9d1je7har71.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=448f83ae9b513d5c51733d31c05335a7b30bdf74

https://preview.redd.it/4w2sit18har71.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e6db7843e3e14da4dff95ca233fc0b31d5c963

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lastly, although somewhat less relevant, let’s compare Google trends for Diablo vs CoD: Warzone vs Fortnite -all very popular games.

https://preview.redd.it/zu3qczi8har71.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f26b1e6b29cb4ae8dbc73b671f8cc5979b8b73a

&#x200B;

Of course, just by the nature of a new Diablo release there will be increase chatter, searches, and trends around the internet. Although expected, it is very nice to see strong growth on all sides. It will be somewhat important to keep an eye on these trends a few months from now.

&#x200B;

Guessing the exact numbers for Diablo 2: Remastered pre-orders and sales on opening weekend is not an easy feat. However, given that D3 sold over 30 million copies in 7 years I think we can expect strong numbers from D2R.

&#x200B;

Looking into the 2022 release of Diablo mobile and the 2023 release of Diablo 4, Diablo 2 could not have been released at a more strategic time to get users back into the Diablo franchise. In my opinion this was a move to setup Diablo 4, coming out in 2023, for an absolute record-breaking release.

&#x200B;

At $40 USD per copy of D2R sold here is some napkin math of estimating revenues based on units sold.

Let’s make a conservative forecast that in it’s lifetime D2R sells 10 million copies with 60% of the units being sold in the first year. 6 million copies sold this year would equate to 240 million in revenue for the Blizzard segment in the next twelve months which has done 1.906 billion in TTM revenues, a 12.6% increase in revenues for this segment. Considering the fact that D2R is mainly a re-skin of the popular game we might also see a slight expansion in margins.

&#x200B;

**The Bear Case(s)**

ActiBlizz has been receiving a lot of bad press and questionable news headlines due to a few ongoing concerns with the company. The first is their recent 18 million dollar deal to settle sexual harassment lawsuits. From bad company reviews on various job boards to losing a lot of senior game designers, the work-place culture has been receiving an extremely bad rap. As much as I hate to see a company making headlines for these reasons, I would have to side on the fact that the financial impact these headlines will have on the company is going to be relatively muted.

&#x200B;

Tied to what was mentioned above and the ongoing concerns of the company’s culture was another headline making the rounds. ActiBlizz’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, has recently cashed in on a 155 million compensation package. His compensation was mainly tied to the performance of ATVI’s share price, which saw a huge organic boost caused by Covid.

&#x200B;

Lastly, China’s recent crackdown on young gamers limits youth to gaming only 3 hours per week. Exactly how this will be enforced by the nation and the impact it will have on the Chinese video gaming market is still unknown.

&#x200B;

**Analyst Targets**

I always take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but looking at all coverage and upgrades in 2021 almost every single analyst covering ATVI has a price target above $110. These upgrades came in earlier in the year when the stock was over $90 per share. Most of the current price targets propose 50% upside to be seen.

https://preview.redd.it/2xxp8ee9har71.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5217fb8322a3636bcd82d3dc8ad57e6319af956

&#x200B;

**Financials**

&#x200B;

*Income Statement*

If you need further confirmation from the tailwinds ATVI has experienced from the start of covid here’s a breakdown revenues over the last several years.

https://preview.redd.it/myeuj7r9har71.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=05f87d69ecf8f5cd732c8780eb9bea3b9c2c4a75

&#x200B;

*Balance Sheet*

The company also has a very strong balance sheet sitting on 8.6 billion in cash, and cash equivalents. This provides huge amounts of leverage for potential acquisitions of smaller IP to even further expand their empire or develop new IP with comprehensive story-lines, media, and  digital assets.

https://preview.redd.it/di22oseahar71.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa00861644b2521fdfa672a8db6812847c6f01d

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

When we compare ATVI to one of their biggest competitors, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), they are pound-for-pound trading at similar valuations with similar metrics (although ATVI does nearly 3x the sales). ATVI’s addressable market will continue to expand with tailwinds effecting the entire gaming industry and they have positioned themselves well to continue dominating the industry. Over the last three months ATVI’s share price has seen a 20% decline from $95 to now $79 per share. Trading at a P/E of 23 it is my opinion that given the strength of their pipeline ATVI is under-valued here with downside being limited.",2021-10-03,33,30

&#x200B;

Next, I’ll look at Reddit’s very own sub-reddit stats and look at the increase in subscribers and sub-reddit activity (comments) for the two most popular Diablo communities, r/Diablo and r/Diablo2.

https://preview.redd.it/aqo9badmgar71.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7dd134e5e51c1e56a77896d2d2393082bd71e49

&#x200B;

Lastly, although somewhat less relevant, let’s compare Google trends for Diablo vs CoD: Warzone vs Fortnite -all very popular games.

https://preview.redd.it/fvvqi18ngar71.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0041eb87a4150a516b8d48ebf2373450059ce3

&#x200B;

Of course, just by the nature of a new Diablo release there will be increase chatter, searches, and trends around the internet. Although expected, it is very nice to see strong growth on all sides. It will be somewhat important to keep an eye on these trends a few months from now.

&#x200B;

Guessing the exact numbers for Diablo 2: Remastered pre-orders and sales on opening weekend is not an easy feat. However, given that D3 sold over 30 million copies in 7 years I think we can expect strong numbers from D2R.

&#x200B;

Looking into the 2022 release of Diablo mobile and the 2023 release of Diablo 4, Diablo 2 could not have been released at a more strategic time to get users back into the Diablo franchise. In my opinion this was a move to setup Diablo 4, coming out in 2023, for an absolute record-breaking release.

&#x200B;

At $40 USD per copy of D2R sold here is some napkin math of estimating revenues based on units sold.

Let’s make a conservative forecast that in it’s lifetime D2R sells 10 million copies with 60% of the units being sold in the first year. 6 million copies sold this year would equate to 240 million in revenue for the Blizzard segment in the next twelve months which has done 1.906 billion in TTM revenues, a 12.6% increase in revenues for this segment. Considering the fact that D2R is mainly a re-skin of the popular game we might also see a slight expansion in margins.

&#x200B;

**The Bear Case(s)**

ActiBlizz has been receiving a lot of bad press and questionable news headlines due to a few ongoing concerns with the company. The first is their recent 18 million dollar deal to settle sexual harassment lawsuits. From bad company reviews on various job boards to losing a lot of senior game designers, the work-place culture has been receiving an extremely bad rap. As much as I hate to see a company making headlines for these reasons, I would have to side on the fact that the financial impact these headlines will have on the company is going to be relatively muted.

&#x200B;

Tied to what was mentioned above and the ongoing concerns of the company’s culture was another headline making the rounds. ActiBlizz’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, has recently cashed in on a 155 million compensation package. His compensation was mainly tied to the performance of ATVI’s share price, which saw a huge organic boost caused by Covid.

&#x200B;

Lastly, China’s recent crackdown on young gamers limits youth to gaming only 3 hours per week. Exactly how this will be enforced by the nation and the impact it will have on the Chinese video gaming market is still unknown.

&#x200B;

**Analyst Targets**

I always take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but looking at all coverage and upgrades in 2021 almost every single analyst covering ATVI has a price target above $110. These upgrades came in earlier in the year when the stock was over $90 per share. Most of the current price targets propose 50% upside to be seen.

&#x200B;

**Financials**

*Income Statement*

If you need further confirmation from the tailwinds ATVI has experienced from the start of covid here’s a breakdown revenues over the last several years.

https://preview.redd.it/fukmn95pgar71.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f29d4c37fe6f8a47fc775fd6fde64271f81bc1c

&#x200B;

*Balance Sheet*

The company also has a very strong balance sheet sitting on 8.6 billion in cash, and cash equivalents. This provides huge amounts of leverage for potential acquisitions of smaller IP to even further expand their empire or develop new IP with comprehensive story-lines, media, and  digital assets.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

When we compare ATVI to one of their biggest competitors, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), they are pound-for-pound trading at similar valuations with similar metrics (although ATVI does nearly 3x the sales). ATVI’s addressable market will continue to expand with tailwinds effecting the entire gaming industry and they have positioned themselves well to continue dominating the industry. Over the last three months ATVI’s share price has seen a 20% decline from $95 to now $79 per share. Trading at a P/E of 23 it is my opinion that given the strength of their pipeline ATVI is under-valued here with downside being limited.",2021-10-03,4,2

# My Conclusion

>**Activision** has many good qualities investors look for in an investment. It has very **popular franchises** that sell all across the world. It has a large player base of over **400 million monthly active users,** Over the last year, the company generated a healthy \*\*free cash flow margin of 33%.\*\*beyond their current operation ATVI is looking to getting themselves into **mobile gaming business.**  
>  
>even though ATVI seems like the natural choice the **bad sentiment** that follows the company might effect sales as more gamers **ban their products.**

&#x200B;

>On the other side **Take-Two** is much smaller and is more dependent on a few franchises like **Rockstar and 2K** , Since *Grand Theft Auto V* launched in 2013, Take-Two's **free cash flow has increased by 347% to $843 million.**  
>  
>Take-Two's **EPS is expected to decline** this year due to the investments in marketing, personnel, IT, and developers, which in a matter of growth, i**nvesting in recruiting is very important**, more over we can see that even in the R&D expanses growth in the last year TTWO surpassed ATVI,  
>  
>**To sum in all up**, in my opinion, **TTWO has the upper hand in this battel.**

Stocks were in the green and the weighted-average returns were 8% while over the last week the following ETFs/indices returned:

A few of you pointed out the Peloton loss specifically, however, the entry on that was $110 and my personal entry was around $108. Peloton pumped a few days before earnings and was over $114 going into the report. The earnings miss and subsequent drop to $104 was, in reality, not that bad.

If you remember my post with Peloton from two weeks ago I actually noted there could be a pretty hard support line at $100 level, which was close to the floor on the earnings drop. My plan would normally be to continue to hold a stock like this because it's still within my ranges, however, I'll highlight a few remarks from the earnings call that are of concern to me and might end up making me sell next week.

***About the 20% price slash of their main bike:***

>Today, we announced our latest step on the journey to broaden the accessibility of our products. We are lowering the price of our original Bike by $400 to $1,495.

&#x200B;

>...the price drop with B1 was absolutely offensive

&#x200B;

>We will continue to prioritize subscription growth over near-term profitability as it's still very early days in the consumer migration to connected fitness in the home.

&#x200B;

***The Good:***

>average connected fitness monthly churn of 0.73% in Q4 and 0.61% for fiscal year 2021.

&#x200B;

>As we announced on Tuesday of this week, we are thrilled to commence U.S. sales and resume U.K. and Canada sales on August 30, finally bringing this incredible product to market in the U.S. ahead of the key holiday selling season.

&#x200B;

***The Bad:***

>Gross margin for the quarter was 27.1%, which came below our expectations. This was entirely due to our connected fitness product segment, which had a gross margin of 11.6%, below our 21% guidance. As I mentioned a moment ago, initial Tread and Tread+ return rates were higher than our forecast as of the third-quarter call.

&#x200B;

>In Q4, we generated total revenue of $937 million, representing 54% year-on-year growth. The primary drivers leading to our revenue outperformance versus guidance were higher-than-expected Bike deliveries and better-than-expected connected fitness churn.

&#x200B;

>This was partially offset by a higher-than-anticipated Tread and Tread+ return rate.

&#x200B;

>The Tread recalls also have some carryover impact on our logistics and warehousing costs, which came in higher than anticipated, rounding out the balance of the shortfall in connected fitness margin versus expectations.

&#x200B;

***Financials & Guidance:***

>We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and liquid assets and have additional liquidity in the form of an untapped $285 million credit facility. As a reminder, our balance sheet benefited in fiscal '21 from approximately $900 million in net proceeds from our convertible note offering completed in February. Now on to our outlook.

&#x200B;

>We are now lapping those comparisons, which makes predicting our year-over-year performance more challenging than normal.

&#x200B;

>In Q1, we expect revenue of approximately $800 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth and an 87% two-year CAGR.

&#x200B;

>Although our profitability will step back in fiscal 2022 for the reasons I've outlined, we are very confident about the economic profile of our business model and expect to be adjusted EBITDA profitable again in fiscal 2023.

&#x200B;

**The Conclusion**

In my opinion, the company has seen some one-time set-backs with recalls which ended up hurting their bottom-line significantly. Consistent EBITDA profitability wash pushed back from 2022 into 2023 now. I wouldn’t normally be too concerned about this, but I did notice management was comparing a lot of their growth and CAGR going back two-years, aka pre-pandemic. From the “guidance” they only expect a 6% growth YoY (!!) and yet they were comparing CAGR to two years ago. This was somewhat alarming and might make me reconsider my position, even though it is a swing trade. I do see a lot of positives about the company, without going into too many details they still:

&#x200B;

* Have incredibly low churn rate, less than 0.75% which is one of the best I’ve ever seen.
* They have a strong segment of recurring revenue with high gross margins coming from connected fitness subscriptions.
* They’ve expanded supply chains and still selling tons of bikes

HOOD had an incredible IPO. The stock price doubled shortly after and has somewhat stabilized over the last week. After this significant drop back to $45 level I like the potential entry point here. We can also see from the right side of the chart there is some gamma exposure to the upside if the stock can get up and above the $50 level.

This stock was over $100 earlier this year and has since dropped to the $80 level. I’ve entered a position and am long the stock here. Disclaimer: management has been under pressure as there are lawsuits/allegations of harassment within the company culture. I’m not sure if this well effect their bottom-line, but at this point I’m willing to buy the dip, similar to TTWO I pointed out not long ago. These two companies are the giants in the industry and with catalysts of new releases coming out in the short-term I like the risk/reward here.

Here’s a look at the GEX and some buying pressures at different levels of ATVI’s stock price. Based on the GEX (gamma exposure), any push above $86-87 will start to initiate some buying pressure by market-makers.

Coupang is a South Korean retailer, similar to Amazon and also Walmart’s grocery delivery segment. CPNG was very hyped on it’s IPO, but has since been on a down-trend. I liked this company in the low $40’s and now that it’s $30 per share I think an entry is favorable. The most interesting thing about CPNG is they have a market cap of 50 billion, sales of 15 billion, while growing revenues between 70-90% YoY.

Chewy is reporting earnings this week. They’ve been in a solid uptrend since May and are sitting at $88 per share at the bottom of the upward trend/channel and also nearing the 50 EMA.

My plan would normally be to continue to hold a stock like this because it's still within my ranges, however, I'll highlight a few remarks from the earnings call that are of concern to me and might end up making me sell next week.

&#x200B;

***About the 20% price slash of their main bike:***

>Today, we announced our latest step on the journey to broaden the accessibility of our products. We are lowering the price of our original Bike by $400 to $1,495.

&#x200B;

>...the price drop with B1 was absolutely offensive

&#x200B;

>We will continue to prioritize subscription growth over near-term profitability as it's still very early days in the consumer migration to connected fitness in the home.

&#x200B;

***The Good:***

>average connected fitness monthly churn of 0.73% in Q4 and 0.61% for fiscal year 2021.

&#x200B;

>As we announced on Tuesday of this week, we are thrilled to commence U.S. sales and resume U.K. and Canada sales on August 30, finally bringing this incredible product to market in the U.S. ahead of the key holiday selling season.

&#x200B;

***The Bad:***

>Gross margin for the quarter was 27.1%, which came below our expectations. This was entirely due to our connected fitness product segment, which had a gross margin of 11.6%, below our 21% guidance. As I mentioned a moment ago, initial Tread and Tread+ return rates were higher than our forecast as of the third-quarter call.

&#x200B;

>In Q4, we generated total revenue of $937 million, representing 54% year-on-year growth. The primary drivers leading to our revenue outperformance versus guidance were higher-than-expected Bike deliveries and better-than-expected connected fitness churn.

&#x200B;

>This was partially offset by a higher-than-anticipated Tread and Tread+ return rate.

&#x200B;

>The Tread recalls also have some carryover impact on our logistics and warehousing costs, which came in higher than anticipated, rounding out the balance of the shortfall in connected fitness margin versus expectations.

&#x200B;

***Financials & Guidance:***

>We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and liquid assets and have additional liquidity in the form of an untapped $285 million credit facility. As a reminder, our balance sheet benefited in fiscal '21 from approximately $900 million in net proceeds from our convertible note offering completed in February. Now on to our outlook.

&#x200B;

>We are now lapping those comparisons, which makes predicting our year-over-year performance more challenging than normal.

&#x200B;

>In Q1, we expect revenue of approximately $800 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth and an 87% two-year CAGR.

&#x200B;

>Although our profitability will step back in fiscal 2022 for the reasons I've outlined, we are very confident about the economic profile of our business model and expect to be adjusted EBITDA profitable again in fiscal 2023.

&#x200B;

**The Conclusion**

In my opinion, the company has seen some one-time set-backs with recalls which ended up hurting their bottom-line significantly. Consistent EBITDA profitability wash pushed back from 2022 into 2023 now. I wouldn’t normally be too concerned about this, but I did notice management was comparing a lot of their growth and CAGR going back two-years, aka pre-pandemic. From the “guidance” they only expect a 6% growth YoY (!!) and yet they were comparing CAGR to two years ago. This was somewhat alarming and might make me reconsider my position, even though it is a swing trade. I do see a lot of positives about the company, without going into too many details they still:

&#x200B;

* Have incredibly low churn rate, less than 0.75% which is one of the best I’ve ever seen.
* They have a strong segment of recurring revenue with high gross margins coming from connected fitness subscriptions.
* They’ve expanded supply chains and still selling tons of bikes

&#x200B;

**Robinhood Markets (HOOD)**

HOOD had an incredible IPO. The stock price doubled shortly after and has somewhat stabilized over the last week. After this significant drop back to $45 level I like the potential entry point here. We can also see from the right side of the chart there is some gamma exposure to the upside if the stock can get up and above the $50 level.

&#x200B;

**Activision Blizzard (ATVI)**

https://preview.redd.it/podv9bi0ldk71.png?width=2430&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e88903acd8a32e9a63aeeffc7eed2a5684b627f

This stock was over $100 earlier this year and has since dropped to the $80 level. I’ve entered a position and am long the stock here. Disclaimer: management has been under pressure as there are lawsuits/allegations of harassment within the company culture. I’m not sure if this well effect their bottom-line, but at this point I’m willing to buy the dip, similar to TTWO I pointed out not long ago. These two companies are the giants in the industry and with catalysts of new releases coming out in the short-term I like the risk/reward here.

&#x200B;

Here’s some larger trades and option flow that came through ATVI on Friday

https://preview.redd.it/hj8lpsr1ldk71.png?width=2126&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fb5eeaa8436377945b956a62e1c67c96313ac80

Here’s a look at the GEX and some buying pressures at different levels of ATVI’s stock price. Based on the GEX (gamma exposure), any push above $86-87 will start to initiate some buying pressure by market-makers.

Coupang is a South Korean retailer, similar to Amazon and also Walmart’s grocery delivery segment. CPNG was very hyped on it’s IPO, but has since been on a down-trend. I liked this company in the low $40’s and now that it’s $30 per share I think an entry is favorable. The most interesting thing about CPNG is they have a market cap of 50 billion, sales of 15 billion, while growing revenues between 70-90% YoY.

Chewy is reporting earnings this week. They’ve been in a solid uptrend since May and are sitting at $88 per share at the bottom of the upward trend/channel and also nearing the 50 EMA. I’m looking for a bounce of these lines and a continuation of the trend. Note: Earnings are more often than not lotto plays.

I like Home Depot and they’ve been a winner throughout Covid. After an incredible run in March from $240 a share to $320 the stock price has now stalled at that level for the last 4 months. It’s now sitting on the the volume profile shelf and I will be looking for a positive catalyst and a push over $330 as volume thins out.",2021-08-29,11,8

lcrl0c_VRTX,VRTX,ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD (ATVI): Today’s earnings call and some unique numbers make this is an interesting stock I wish I had jumped on.,"Right now, Activision is having its quarterly earnings call. Reports are saying $3.05 billion versus $2.78 billion expected, and earnings per share: $1.21 versus $1.17 expected:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html

I don’t own any at the moment, but I wish I had made a major investment. I had been filtering stocks, and a few stats about Activision stuck out to me. Activision has:

* Over 70% gross profit margin
* Over 30% growth in earnings per share this quarter
* Over 30% growth in sales this quarter
* Positive sales growth over past five years
* P/E under 40

Only five other large cap stocks share these characteristics:

* Alexandria Real Estate - ARE
* Facebook - FB			
* Horizon Therapeutics - HZNP
* KKR & Co. - KKR
* Vertex Pharma - VRTX			

Every other stock with those growth, sales, and margin numbers are stocks with insanely high P/E ratios, like Etsy (123) or NovoCure (2486 lol). But you’ve got this group of stocks with what looks like value P/E ratios under 40: Activision, Facebook, two medical tech companies, and two financial companies. And all of them are generally regarded as strong buys. 

But there’s something unique in my mind about Activision. Biotech is volatile, prone to setbacks on a technical or regulatory level even before you start talking business fundamentals. And I know the finance companies are good buys. But Activision’s business model seems more insulated from the some of the pitfalls of the market. It was a strong COVID business and not one that I personally see taking a post-COVID recovery hit. 

This is one of those rare companies where the numbers looks fantastic, I’m familiar with the industry, and I like the company’s products. I’ll probably get invested soon. Just going to wait to see how its price responds to the earnings call. I'd be very interested to hear what others think.",2021-02-04,65,51

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

i4z9qp_ATVI,ATVI,"Successful week! +$306 with a 90.91% win ratio overall! Saw this Ascending Triangle too! SPY, IWM, ATVI, GPRO","What up everyone!  


Had another awesome week-week and a half trading options! Saw that the SPY was forming a nice ascending triangle and took advantage of it! Anyone else catch that and trade it? Had a successful bull put on that badboy. Sold the 313 and bought the 312, which was right where I have my horizontal support level (313) and out of the way of the bottom support of the diagonal for the ascending triangle if it kept that trend, which it did!  


Also saw a bullput on IWM and ATVI! Remaking the original Tony Hawk games AND having World of Warcraft curing a quarantined America seems to be good for them this past week hahah. The spreads get screwy on ATVI so I'm gonna procedd with caution if I wanna trade them again. If you are curious what Im talking about, throw it in on a paper money account and watch it. Interesting to see both the bought and sold puts in profits at the same time for a random day or two. Unfortunately they wont accept the trade to get me out in that situation haha. Still keep full credit as planned though.  


I'm also holding 100 shares of GPRO and have been chipping away at the price with covered calls. Every week I make like 8 or 9 bucks on it for it to not hit my strike price lol. Aiming to get the shares essentially for free. I love this strategy because even if it does hit my strike and sells my shares, it will sell in a profit margin from where I bought it at. Anyone else do this for their portfolio? I love this strategy!  


I have been making videos of my trading journey and trying to show people exactly what I do to make my successful trades and why I am making them, hoping to help people to learn, or at least entertain them with my journey! I plan to be fully honest with trades that are successful or not, but I havent lost a trade in the last 20 trades. My very first two I lost money on, then retook my course  I bought like 5 times and spoke with a mentor and have been documenting my trades ever since!

It's been a year since their partner Tencent applied for COD Mobile's license, it's really hard to get licensing for video games in China since the licensing rules reform.

Think about that crappy PUBG Moblie has almost 30m players in China, this approval is likely gonna bring at least 30M new players for COD francise, thats almost the same as the Bllizzard's whole MAU base.

BTW, I am super bullish that Diablo Mobile(coming this year) and D4 are gonna add tremendous amount of players to Blizzard's MAU base (Blizzard's lagging MAU is probably the reason ATVI was down yesterday). So their future looks bright to me.

i26hh9_TTWO,TTWO,TTWO and ATVI earnings speculations.,"With the success of NBA 2020, Red Dead Redemption II, and GTA V, I think TTWO is going to beat earnings expectations by quite a lot. ATVI could also be a great play, as COD: Modern Warfare is doing quite well. Both companies are in really good shape in terms of their financials with their massive cash positions, and they've never been this popular before. ATVI and TTWO are sitting at around $6 billion and $2 billion in cash respectively with little debt. They have massive potentials for growth with decent PE ratios considering today's standards, and these gaming stocks have never seen a better time than now when most of the country is staying indoors.

Let's be real here, every teen this summer is either gaming or streaming Riley Reid's educational videos on the hub. Since our beloved hub hasn't gone public yet, I am willing to bet heavily on gaming stocks this earnings week.

I'm thinking TTWO 175c's and ATVI 88c's for 08/07 at open for quick tendies. However, going long might be a safer and a much wiser option considering how much these companies can grow in the coming months and years.",2020-08-02,53,52

I’m gonna be honest I don’t really know what to do. I expect their earnings will be good and the share price will go up making my contact worth a little bit more. So do you think the best day to sell it would be 8/5? I don’t want to let it expire because that would mean I have to buy 100 shares at $83 each, right? And I don’t have that kind of money.

hvc55a_ATVI,ATVI,ATVI (Activision/Blizzard) Worth Buying at this higher Price?,"Activision has been killing it this year.  Everyone staying home and playing video games.  They also got super lucky releasing their new Call of Duty in Mar before/during the entire Corona Virus lockdown.  The micro transactions have been going through the roof profitability wise as well as their MAUs (Monthly Active Users) are up.  

My question is: are they still worth buying into?  I know people say buy and hold for 5 years and they most likely will go up in the next five years sure.  But is their gargantuan 79.11% gain YoY warranted? Are they overpriced or worth even more?  Some analyst are saying their stock should be around 86$ or 90$ but those are recent analyst hoping for a huge beat on their earnings.  What kind of earnings are they going to have to have to have another 12% increase? Or are they doomed to fall back to 70/75 where they were for about 3 months.

COVID-19 is proving to be a near term positive catalyst for the entire gaming industry, but ATVI stands out with its timely release of Call of Duty Warzone. Analyst checks indicate both the COD franchise and World of Warcraft engagement have been strong through March.

ffxxg5_ATVI,ATVI,ATVI DD - Free Tendies,"Activision has beaten their EPS 4/4 since last year.  If you don't know Activision-Blizzard is responsible for creating Call of Duty, Overwatch, and a few other games.  They're one of the biggest gaming companies in the world.  They are also the biggest player in the E-Sports movement, as they own MLG, and are starting their Call of Duty: Modern Warfare E-Sports League soon, that just got even more sponsors.  They've been hit by corona virus, but not nearly as much as the general stock market, and I believe they should actually have gone up because of the virus.  The only reason that they are lagging behind is because of digital art creation, with around \~50% internationally taking place in China, and they've already started sourcing from other places.

&#x200B;

**China is the biggest consumer of Video Games, with annual revenue of \~$34 Billion**.  For the same reason that Netflix is up because of the virus, Activision should be up too.  People are quarantined to their houses internationally, left with digital content as their only source of entertainment in their life.  Before the crash, Activision was sitting comfortably at $64, now it's at $58 and there's no logical reason for it to be.  People just got scared that it would follow the general stock market.  The average analyst price target is $68, $10 above where its at this very moment.  Because of this strange oppurtunity, my bet, which I believe to be safe and extremely profitable is

**Buy ATVI $60 Call 5/15 Expiration**

&#x200B;

This will guarantee profit, as it is after the EPS, when people will realize the virus was actually good for Activision.

ddde6r_ATVI,ATVI,ATVI Pt. 3: THE CANCELLED PRE-ORDER,"*TL:DR: ATVI Finna get REKT this month see spoonfed trades at the bottom.*

**We're going to jump right into it.** [**Previous thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cti6rb/classic_wow_the_numbers_atvi_50_incoming/)

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

So ATVI hit 55$, earnings season is dropping soon and Modern Warfare is all over the internet in beta.

**First off Let's talk Classic Wow:**

Classic Wow is and was about as successful as I expected before blizzard cut the API supporting the census addons it was looking like more than 3 million subs were added. That's a lot of dough but just as I thought 2 weeks in majority of my friends who were dying of excitement to raid talking about how they were going to rule azeroth dropped off in the level 20's. The game is just way too hard and time-consuming for your average gamer nowadays, I estimate they will keep a solid 2 million subscriptions for the first 6 months and that it will stabilize in the 500k-1Mil range.

**Overall, it was a great success**

They just made probably close to 100 million dollars re-launching a game over a decade old. The game is just a passive income drip to the exec's now and it is likely to forever remain that. I don't think they're going to fuck this up it'll be around for years now and likely we'll see talk of a BC classic server in a few years from now. Not to mention a TON of people went over to BFA after realizing they like WoW but actually are casual scrubs now that want to play retail.

**So why do I think they're about to get rekt? 1 word COD**

I bought Modern Warfare pre-order, I was super hyped all the footage and interviews were touting a game that was actually a genuine revival of the cult-classic and people were actually calling it the best COD they've ever played. Flash forward to today and I've canceled my pre-order as of a week ago.

**The shitstorm is coming Randy...**

I follow a decent selection of youtube gaming commenters, this gives me a complete picture of the ""buzz"" in gaming circles and right now ALL OF THEM, are dropping videos about modern warfare and activisions decision to literally lock out an entire mode from PC & XBOX for a year. Personally, when I heard the news I instantly canceled my pre-order not because I didn't enjoy the game, **DEADASS it was the best cod I have ever played in my entire life period.**

**Me and a metric-fuck-ton of gamers have drawn a line in the sand with these AAA publishers though.**

This is not going to fly and the PR backlash is going to be insane, KEEP IN MIND THIS IS GOOD FOR US. The stock price is going to drop in response to the wave of hate that is coming their way and I haven't even started talking about the lootboxes which are going to contain exclusive weapons **i.e. actual pay to win.**

**If you remember the EA battlefront 2 fiasco over lootboxes, just know if ATVI doesn't stand down this is WORSE.**

Gamers are fucking tired of lootboxes, we don't give a shit if you want to charge us for skins we will gladly pay for them as evident by the many skins I own in a wide variety of games. The major difference here is the Gambling randomness, NO ONE except the whales likes the idea of boxes containing actual weapons that can give you an advantage over other players even if just statistical. This shit is going to prematurely-bukkake all over their faces like a room full of sweaty Japanese nerds on their first day shooting porn.

\_\_\_\_\_

**""Okay, that was a lot of Sweaty DD where are the tendies?""**

Earnings will release, the numbers will show low and be-hold literally nothing the internet says matters because Stacy is going to buy her son Call of Duty anyway it's the only fucking game she knows the name of, big fucking surprise.

Price will spike on the amazing sales report from COD & WoW & All the other parts of ATVI that no one knows are really producing them money like fucking candy crush. **The investors don't give a flying fuck what some salty gamers think, but they do follow the news, bad news scares them, good numbers make them happy.**

**Spoonfed Trades:**

ATVI stock price will drop in response to the backlash coming in the next few weeks,

**Buy puts ASAP if you are Bear gang.**

*Nov. 8th 2019, 50$ Put's* <- ^(I won't be buying any of these as I don't fuck with puts my testicles are rather minuscule.)

**FUCKING NOTE: ONLY when ATVI is at 50$ or lower do I suggest buying back in.**

The price will then stagnate until earnings a few weeks later this is the time to **buy calls if you are Bull gang.**

Feb, 21, 2020 60$ Calls <-^(After the PR shock to the Activision price, these will be dirt fucking cheap.)

*^(This isn't financial advice blah blah, do your own DD, something something inverse wsb.)*

d09c3u_ATVI,ATVI,Does this sound like I understand options? Regarding ATVI options," 

I'm on Robinhood looking at options. I just need help understanding something and was wondering if someone could check my understanding or explain it better.

Activision Blizzard closed at $54.50 a share.

I'm interested and looking at 11/15 call options. One section is out of the money (I think correct me if I'm wrong) with the call being $60 at $1.75, $57.5 at $2.55, and $55 at $3.60. These are less because time is a factor and the risk is more?

The center states the share price at 54.50.

Below is In the money calls (again, please correct if I'm wrong) calls at $52.5 at $4.95, $50 at $6.58, 47.5 at $8.45 etc. These are in the money because it's below the value of the stock price and the risk is less therefore making it more expensive?

How is the contract price calculated? How are strike prices determined? I want to buy $55 call @ $3.60 a share price. I understand its 100 shares per contract. The breakeven for that one is $58.60.

My position looks to be out of the money if I were to go in. But I anticipate there will probably be a dip and the president will probably tweet something that will make it go down and thats when I'll go in. Let me know if any of this makes sense.... lol...

**50$ 8/30 calls jumped 30 cents yesterday from .39 to .69 and this morning spiked up to .90...**

WoW peaked at 12 million subscriptions I've put together a little chart to show you the potential revenues from classic.

[This, of course, is only Classic wow...](https://preview.redd.it/3w76l994dth31.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec567b5a73744db24bb1d9b9b260515a22ae0e37)

The next thing to consider is how many of those players that re-sub to Classic turn around and move into Retail WoW? If we assume only 10% do with BFA selling at 63$ that's the same money as almost another 4 months of subscriptions, the money from subscription-based games is god tier.

There is content in the game that requires players to play together in a 40 man group consistently on a weekly basis clearing bosses to farm for 1% drops it's incomprehensible the amount of time and grinding Classical WoW has in it these people will be ENTHRALLED.

[https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png](https://i.redd.it/h30ou6w47sg31.png)

Right now when I log in to Classic Wow there are 6 servers registering as FULL let alone all the high population and mediums aaaand, **this is just in NA the Europeans are even more crazy about games think about all the Competitive E-sports teams from the Scandanavian regions those guys go HARD af and their WoW players are just the same competing for world firsts with everyone else.**

A full server back then would have around 10k+ players on it blizzard has already stated servers will hold more players than before because of the layering system they've built which allows multiple people to play in the same areas without causing disruption to gameplay because of competition over quest spawns etc.

**So just in players that have logged in to secure their name the numbers are already over 100k.**

There are people who've taken weeks off of work to dedicate to playing, they're flying around the world to meet with old guildmates and planning on binging on take out and neglecting sleep. We're talking practically the most addicting game ever released, just think about that 12 million sub peak. That was 12 million people paying 14.99$ a month JUST TO PLAY A GAME. This shit is not a joke, the video games industry is already overtaking the entertainment industry don't underestimate these companies.

They may draw scandals but take it from me a player that's lived through many game company scandals, it didn't stop me from buying and it didn't stop me from playing. We're all addicted to this shit and it's a low maintenance cash cow.

We are on the cusp of passing 50$ again, if the news goes well today it could be big gains but prepare for the worst all the analyst reports are spouting ""the no major releases this quarter"". Though Hearthstone does rake in quite a bit and the expansion it dropped could be enough to bump up the companies bottom line this quarter!

ckj58r_ATVI,ATVI,Turning a long call into a spread a good idea? (ATVI example),"I've watched the guys on CNBC present spreads where they limit their upside for as little as 10% reduction in purchase price, which always struck me as a strange thing to do. What about turning a long call into a spread after the underlying has moved up? What's good criteria for doing that?

For example, you might have bought a 9/20 ATVI 52.5 call for 1.00 yesterday. Today, the stock went up $2 for a while, and the option went up to 1.70 or so. That's a decent 1 day return, and you could sell it or continue riding it out and risking the 1.00, but you noticed the 55's went up to 1.00, so you could turn it into a 52.5/55 spread for net 0 investment.

Also with battle royal being the hot new game mode, $ATVI can use it's already popular title and it's fan base to utilize Blackout and get more players over to the game.

It's currently sitting pretty at #1 of the Amazon ps4 games list with almost exclusively 5 star reviews and that is good indicator we will see a surprise earnings boost.

Things are also looking swell for other products as well - Overwatch has gained almost 25% new players since the free trials in May on PC alone. Consoles are likely to have had great numbers as well. 

Given the recent rise of $TTWO, the future pipeline of Destiny 2, Call of Duty and more Overwatch crates in the holiday season it's a safe bet that $ATVI is a buy right now at $62.

So why buy $ATVI? Well it's already a good indication that with Destiny 2 presales and Call of Duty WW hitting shelves in shortly, things are looking up for revenue forecasts I can see.

To add onto the fact, Robert Craft (Patriots Owner) and several other rich white guys with lots of money are buying E-Sports teams for MILLIONS of dollars. This is something that makes me believe that Activision can sustain healthy growth over the next year and even for at least 5 years of steady growth if E-Sports continues to take off.

$TTWO was trading at $63.50 back in May. Right where ATVI is at right now.

With Call of Duty returning to the arena that made it one of the top FPS titles in gaming history, Destiny 2 launching off the back of a hugely successful first game, Blizzard with their titles, and E-Sports growing at an infinite rate... $ATVI has no where to go but up in my opinion.

6baz32_MA,MA,"My Top 3 Stock Picks for 2017 - $MU, $BABA, and $ATVI","**Activision/Blizzard (ATVI)** [Check my analysis out on GravyTrades!](https://www.gravytrades.com/trading-and-research/atvi-looking-minds-gamers/)

The videogame conglomerate of Activision/Blizzard has been a dominant force among in the gaming industry, and there are several reasons to be bullish moving into 2018 and beyond. Gaming is an industry that, even more so than others, needs to understand, and think from the perspective of their customers. The companies team of engineers and developers have worked hard to provide a positive experience for their customers, something that I believe will pay off immensely moving into the future. 

The gaming community has grown tired of paying top dollar for mediocre add on content, so the Overwatch developers worked hard to make content for fans to get excited about, and it worked. By releasing high quality expansions including new maps, game modes, characters, and more, consumers are willing to invest in the future of the game. Viewing Overwatch as something as simply a videogame would not lend enough credit to the developers, and their aggressive roadmap for the title. Blizzard is looking to build an empire from the popularity of Overwatch by continuing to provide value to people who invest in the game through high quality expansion packs, and by quickly responding to concerns from players about critical issues like cheating and hacking, both of which can severely impact the playing experience for everyone who purchases the game. We’ve seen how quickly a misleading and poor development team can ruin an experience for an entire community (looking at you No Man’s Sky), and the effect of a talented, active team of developers can have just as powerful an impact on the future growth of Activision. 

The professional e-sports scene that Activision has heavy exposure to is growing rapidly. In fact, demand for tournament style playing grew beyond scheduled tournaments at convention centers, prompting the construction of a massive multi-level 30,000 square foot e-sports gaming arena. People will play games for money, like a casino, and the arena plans to open its doors in 2018. I believe that within the next several years, this type of business will expand to include multiple locations across the United States, and globally. We’ve seen e-sports rapid growth in China, where users can visit café’s and rent gaming PC’s to play their favorite games, the only difference being that users could make money from playing these games that they love. Activision’s diverse portfolio of companies and acquisitions gives them a competitive advantage in the industry due to the vast categories of fans that they create content for. 

Activision has likes to guide conservatively, so estimates will likely be beaten. As Activision transitions Overwatch more heavily into e-sports this will create consistent and growing revenue to grow the franchise beyond a computer game and into an empire. Sales are strong, with 50% revenue growth year over year, and plenty of avenues to expand in the future. The board of directors has also implemented a $1 billion stock repurchase program, returning value to shareholders and showing confidence in the company’s future growth. I am long this stock from $53.34, and I plan on continuing to add to my position. 

**Alibaba Holding (BABA)**

China’s economy is growing at a rapid pace, and one of the companies leading this growth is Alibaba Group. Alibaba’s is known for its massive presence in ecommerce and online shopping, even in the US. This company presents a unique opportunity for investors as both a speculative play, and a great investment in a large profitable company. The companies diversity of holdings includes cloud computing, marketing & advertising, ecommerce, and payment processing, all of which are growing, and competitive markets. 
	
One of the company’s strongest areas of growth are in its payment processing platform, Alipay. Alipay is a standard method of payment in China, and is comparable to Apple Pay, or Visa Checkout in the US. Alibaba recently entered a partnership with a First Data, a US based payment processing company, which opens the Alipay platform to be accepted at more than 4 million businesses in America. This will give Chinese vacationers and visitors an easier way to spend money in the US, where tourist regularly spend billions of dollars annually. In fact, they have an aggressive growth plan to expand this around the world creating a universal payment system. In fact, Alipay has already expanding to 70 countries around the world. Adding to this, the growth numbers we saw from Visa and PayPal’s earnings goes to show that mobile payments are strong and are consistently increasing in processing volume.  If Alipay can grow to compete on a global scale in the ways they’re hoping to, then they are in a very strong position against competition, like Amazon and Walmart. 

Aside from mobile payments, cloud computing is another rising technology with immense potential to expand in consumer and professional markets. Alibaba leads this space with 40% of the cloud computing market share thanks to AliCloud. They have over half a million paying users, and with Microsoft reporting strong margins and growth in cloud computing, I believe this technology will be a driving force behind the success of this company moving into the future. Revenue growth for AliCloud is up over 100% year over year thanks to heavy expansion into enterprise markets and partnerships with Nvidia and Intel to improve the technology they use for their cloud computing solutions. The services that are offered manage to be affordable while remaining on the bleeding edge of cybersecurity and computing technology. 

Alibaba’s dominance in China and continued success as they expand into the US markets and beyond is where I see the value in this company. CEO Jack Ma has a strong understanding of the effect of the Internet on global economies, and his strides to move Alibaba into a position to be competitive in worldwide markets with leading technology puts themselves in an optimal position to become a dominant world force in Ecommerce and cloud computing over the next several years and beyond. Alibaba’s strong leadership paired with aggressive potential for growth in cutting edge sectors of technology make it a strong investment given the current world market and political conditions. I am long since $115.10, and I plan on holding through earnings on Thursday. 

**Micron (MU)**

Micron is a leading producer of NAND memory for computers and datacenters. In the past, Micron’s stock price has been influenced almost entirely on the demand and prices for NAND memory as a commodity. Many investors don’t like this stock due to its “commodity like” price fluctuations and lack of fundamentals, but that’s all beginning to change. 

Micron makes the most money during NAND shortages, which the market is currently experiencing, improving margins and demand. Micron is trading a very low valuation to future earnings (forward p/e is around 6.5x) on the fear that the tides could shift and cause memory prices, and the stock price, to fall with increased supply and competing prices. Here’s where I think analysts such as Goldman Sachs go wrong with their ‘Neutral’ sentiment on Micron. The recent report from Goldman Sachs highlighted the fact that NAND prices are at their peak, offering little upside to the current stock price.  However, as the value of data and information continues to expand, large companies like Facebook, Google and Alibaba continue to build and expand their datacenters to keep up with the rapid growth of their platforms. To say that NAND prices are at their peak would also largely correlate to a peak in demand, which isn’t something that looks to be slowing. In fact, Nvidia reported a 48% increase in quarterly datacenter revenue, beating expectations by a 28.6%, largely powering Micron’s rally last week. Micron is currently the only provider to Nvidia of GDDR5X memory, an improvement upon the previous GDDR5 technology that is still used by competitors. Given how widely adopted Nvidia’s technology is used among the largest players in the data market, it’s safe to say that Micron’s sales will continue to improve on the top and bottom line.

I also believe that introducing Sanjay Mehrotra as the new CEO is a positive move for the company and his goals to diversify Micron will open the way for investors to take a second look at the previously speculative company. Sanjay was the CEO of SanDisk and adds experience running a public traded memory company, which was bought by Western Digital in 2016. Interest in new acquisitions will improve the diversity among Microns product offerings, which will create stability where the stock previous fell vulnerable to NAND memory price fluctuations. 

In recent earnings report from Western Digital and Seagate, both companies reported that “Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to a favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and has helped mitigate typical seasonality” (Western Digital earnings report). While analysts believe that prices have peaked, industry leaders insist that prices will only continue to rise because Samsung will not be introducing new supply to the market. Many bears believe that rising prices will lower demand for datacenter builders, but these builders put a higher priority on system stability and performance rather than prices, due to the seemingly inelastic demand for datacenter components in the new age of collecting and using data on a large scale. Google, Facebook and the other leaders of the “mass data” industry are only interested in investing in top of the line datacenter equipment, almost regardless of cost. These companies can’t afford for their datacenters to fail under any circumstance, as the costs encountered due to server crashes and issues are far higher than the money they would save on lower quality components. 

I believe that the times of Micron trading at just 5.4x future earnings will soon come to end, as their earnings reports will continue to show growth and diversification among the technology and datacenter markets. I am long this stock with ~$25 cost basis, and only intend on adding to my position as the next earnings report approaches.

4ab0jn_ATVI,ATVI,First stab at a valuation: Activision Blizzard Inc. Comments and criticism welcomed!,"**Investment Thesis**

I am recommending a Buy position for Activision Blizzard Inc. Based on multiple valuation methods, the average fair market value of ATVI is $41.33. Activision is the largest video game firm in the world. It currently controls the entire video game realm with famous franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, and the recently acquired Candy Crush. ATVI also owns Major League Gaming, a professional esports organization that hosts major video game tournaments worldwide. I believe they are positioned for a large growth as they enter a new genre of gaming with their Overwatch, first person shooter game. They are also expected to release a movie in 2016 made after the hit franchise Warcraft. And as Virtual Reality systems such as Occulus develop, so too will ATVI build games for that arena.

**EIC Analysis**

**Economy**

The markets have been very volatile at the beginning of 2016 giving ATVI a YTD return of nearly -18% while the S&P 500 only suffered -5%. The economy for video games is still very strong and worldwide. Four out of five households owned a video game console in 2014 and the U.S Computer and Video game sales have been increasing, even through the financial crisis.[1] Over the last five years, ATVI has had a total return of 200%, outperforming the S&P 500 by near 4x.

**Industry**

The video game industry is in a mature state characterized by cyclical growth and strong competition. The industry relies on constant new releases of popular video games to attract consumer sentiment and fuel demand. Over the last decade we’ve seen a large shift over to “social games” being played on devices that connect to the internet. Sales are largely generated through new channels that incorporate downloadable content, in-game purchases, advertisement revenue, and subscription fees. Esports has also risen to play a major role in gaming industry. MLG hosts professional competitions in CounterStrike: GO, Call of Duty, DOTA 2, Starcraft, and Halo. The amount of live viewers for esports events overall have been increasing over the year as we see more and more international competitive play amongst new games. Last year, the largest esports event reached 36 million in 2015.[2]

**Company**

Activision is primarily driven by the sale of its video games. They have large market shares in all types of gaming systems including mobile, console, and PC. They recently acquired King Digital, producer of Candy Crush, the top downloaded game in the iOS store in 2015[3] and ranked #6 in the highest grossing app.[4] They are also known for World of Warcraft, the largest Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game in the world which hit a subscriber base of 12.5 million players in 2012[5], and are currently reaping a base subscription fee of $15 per player per month. Last year, ATVI generated around $4.6B in revenue while King generated around $2B. Together in 2016, they are expected to generate around $6.5B.

**DCF/NPV Valuation**

A DCF model was created to estimate ATVI’s net present value . The following assumptions were made: a 6% projected growth for 2016 from the completion of the King Digital acquisition, revenues from mobile would grow from last year as the smart phone industry grew, and a conservative yet consistent year-on-year growth between 1-2% for the next 10 years with a terminal growth rate of 2%.

http://i.imgur.com/gWPUcvy.png

http://i.imgur.com/F8EV8z5.png

http://i.imgur.com/FRFlflg.png

ATVI historically has no debt. They recently took on debt for the purchase of King Digital and has been paying it down annually. I project this debt will be completely paid off in the future and accounted for that in our assumptions. Their NPV and Share price is highly affected by the discount rate and growth rate. As they move away from debt and towards full equity, their value increases.

http://i.imgur.com/ET5nK59.png

http://i.imgur.com/jQMU5K0.png

WACC Calculation: http://imgur.com/ZngMxuo

**APV Valuation**

An APV model was also created to account for their change in capital structure. ATVI went from historically no debt, to taking on close to $5B in debt on their balance sheet after acquiring King Digital. Their long-term debt has decreased this year. I'm inferring that ATVI does not tend to take on debt and will pay this off. Therefore, an APV valuation would reflect a closer accurate towards the company’s intrinsic value. The APV value for the firm came out to $33.10 per share. The below picture shows the APV projected cash flow and tax shields. This is under the assumption that ATVI does not take on anymore debt or acquisitions and continues to gradually pay off their current debt.

http://i.imgur.com/Ils2Hw1.png

http://i.imgur.com/BjDWAKO.png

**PE EPS Multiple Valuation**

The last method of valuating ATVI was to project the EPS growth over the next 10 years and multiple the terminal EPS by the forward P/E ratio. Their Price-to-Earnings ratio is currently 25.63. Their expected EPS in year 2025E is 1.65. This is using a conservative approach assuming their outstanding shares remain constant. Using the projected DCF model as a base, the estimated fair value based on the PE EPS multiple was $42.27.

http://i.imgur.com/dyZ61KK.png

**Technical Analysis**

Based on technical analysis, the stock has dropped almost 20% from its 52-week highs. On the monthly chart, we can see a very strong convicting bounce off the 20-day moving average. The moving averages are ordered in a bullish manner and the most recent red candlestick shows very strong buy volume from its long tail.

http://i.imgur.com/XW30axX.png


**Conclusion**

Activision is expected to have a huge boost in earnings this year due to the King Acquisition. I expect growth to subside the following year but remain stable as mobile games grow slowly with console and PC. Outside of mobile, I project 7% growth in PC revenues and 9% growth in console games over the year. Operating margins have increased slowly since 2014 and will expect to grow on average 1% a year. The recommend fair value price is based off three different valuations that all result in a higher expected share price. I expect ATVI’s share price to increase by 20% over the next 10 years in a neutral to bullish economy.

Not sure how many of you guys are gaming nerds, I for one am not any more at least for over a decade.

This is very interesting news IMO, it is essentially the same concept as Disney with Marvel. The extent of consumer penetration might not be the same, but I know Blizzard has a bunch of sci-fi themed games that have a cult following and the movies might be more in line with the lord of the rings series to give you an idea of fan fervor. 

Activision Blizzard was one of my earliest investments in 2008, but I sold early for a small profit after 4-5 years of near 0 price movement. It looks like the stock has finally moved in recent years.

Just want to get others thoughts on this for now, I haven't really followed the stock for years so I would like to get a good idea about consumer's perception about the movies. The stock tanked after the news broke out so that's a hint I guess from investors?

The weird part is that ATVI had their hit games before the price run up circa 2013. The stock essentially had the run up after the fervor of all the hit games was pretty much dead or running out of steam. Weird IMO.",2015-11-07,10,9

3jhxqo_TTWO,TTWO,"Hey gamers, time to invest in Activision Blizzard?","As you probably remember, Heroes of the Storm game was released three months ago and has shown potential for very strong user growth.

It might give Activision Blizzard access to the vast and rapidly growing market of multiplayer online battle arena games.

Looking quite interesting to invest. Never been playing video games actually, therefore need your opinion. Is it that good to push the stock price up? I wanna play long here.",2015-09-03,6,42
3j9odl_TTWO,TTWO,"Opinions on EA, ATVI and TTWO?","I have high interests in video & computer games.

EA, ATVI and TTWO caught my eyes and it seems like they've been performing pretty well until the recent crash.

For now, I think ATVI has a slight advantage out of all three with an upcoming Warcraft movie, WoW expansion pack, Skylanders and CoD on their way (plus, they recently made it into S&P500.)

EA also outperformed their expected outcomes this year so EA can also me a great choice. 

(Especially with Star Wars Battlefront releasing soon.)

As for TTWO, their NBA 2k Online has been going viral in China, so this might take into affect anytime soon.

What are your opinions on these three?",2015-09-01,1,3

They are also coming out with new expansions for World of Warcraft, a new ""season"" for Diablo III, they have a new forthcoming game called Overwatch and they have a new expansion for the popular console game Skylanders that looks pretty amazing. They are up $1.50 in pre-market trading and the market is opening now. Take a look.",2015-08-28,21,47
3gh2fs_ATVI,ATVI,$ATVI - Opinions?,"Activision Blizzard has a pretty strong hold on certain aspects of the video game industry. Not only do they own Call of Duty,  very popular FPS, but also World of Warcraft, and most notably, a growing card game, Hearthstone.

They recently released an expansion for World of Warcraft and are about to release a large expansion for Hearthstone. They also have a new game ""Overwatch"" in development, which seems very promising.

I don't know the history or reputation of $ATVI but I believe that the company can grow a lot with these new releases.

Thoughts?

My main concern is that the options spreads seem much less active than stocks like AAPL or NFLX. Are options for less actively traded stocks less likely to grow in value before/at expiry?

This will not be a lot of money and if I lose it all it will have been worth the knowledge I obtained. I am just looking for some insight.",2015-01-12,1,10
2mw3z8_ATVI,ATVI,ATVI Activision Blizzard?,"So Warcraft is back up to 10m monthly subscribers for the new expansion see http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/ 

The new call of duty is a fairly good refresh of the franchise and refines the game in some areas. There are also more games in the pipeline with heroes of the storm.

The stock currently trades at 21x earnings at the current price of 21$ and 14-15x future earnings according to analysts estimates.

The stock is trading at $21 putting it on the same valuation as EA it trades at over $24 easily and ATVI appears to have more room for growth.

EA went up 20% on earnings, TTWO went down initially after earnings but came back up a few days later. I am wondering if ATVI will follow the trend with whats coming up for them.

Could ATVI be going up on AH and tomorrow since they could also announce cod first day estimates at the conference call?

18drab_ATVI,ATVI,[Advice] Sell ATVI or Hold?,"Hi all,

I bought ATVI around 2 years ago and have since cost averaged it down to a cost basis of $585.39 holding 46.88 shares.  It finally broke into positive ground for me, hitting a market value of $637.61 at 13.60/share or a 8.92% gain; again over roughly 2 years. 

I initially bought ATVI when I first started investing; thinking mostly that I wanted to invest in a company that I ""knew"" about and since I'm a ""gamer"" it seemed logical.  It hasn't turned out to be a bad investment per-say, just a fairly uninteresting one that has yeilded VERY slow gains, and frankly, although I am up enough now to cover the cost of sale, it wouldn't be the first time and I've seen ATVI drop back down before.

Anyway, to be frank it's not a lot of money either way - I don't really ""care"" all too much, just wondering if its worth selling and re-investing in something else like a GE (which I already have; but wouldn't mind putting more into) or something else; or should I stick with it, collect their yearly dividend and hope they go up from 13.60...

Thanks Brovestors in advance.
