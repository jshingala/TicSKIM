I have 100 shares and i am at 98% profit right now. Should i sell about 25 if it its 100% or more and then buy back if it dips a little? 

A part of me is tempted to realize some profits but a part of me also worries that my dividend will lessen and it may climb up further and i will miss realizing more profits on those 25 shares. ",2025-05-29,8,13

Is it better to leave the funds in AVGO due to the potential stock price growth in the next five years, or does having the extra funds in QQQI produce a better total ROI? I also have funds in SCHD that equal the funds of AVGO and QQQI combined, so if I merged AVGO and QQQI, I would still have dividend funds spread out between two equities.

1j9j16t_INTC,INTC,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

# Alibaba Shares Soar After Chinese Tech Giant Unveils New DeepSeek Rival

**China just went all-in on AI, and Wall Street is taking notes.**

Alibaba sent shockwaves through the stock market after unveiling its latest AI reasoning model, QwQ-32B, a high-efficiency rival to OpenAI and DeepSeek. The news ignited a frenzy‚ÄîAlibaba‚Äôs Hong Kong shares spiked 8.4%, dragging China‚Äôs tech index up 5.4%, with Tencent and Kuaishou notching double-digit gains. Investors, it seems, aren‚Äôt just buying into Alibaba‚Äîthey‚Äôre buying into China‚Äôs AI dominance.

**The AI Arms Race Is Heating Up**  
  
China‚Äôs tech giants are rolling out AI models at breakneck speed. Tencent just introduced its open-source video model Hunyuan, Kuaishou launched its own AI-driven platform, and Manus AI debuted a ‚Äúgeneral AI agent‚Äù that claims to outperform OpenAI‚Äôs DeepResearch. Meanwhile, Alibaba is pouring $53 billion into AI infrastructure over the next three years, betting big that its latest model will cement its place at the top.

**China‚Äôs AI Push Is Government-Backed‚ÄîAnd It Shows**  
  
Beijing isn‚Äôt just watching from the sidelines‚Äîit‚Äôs fueling the AI boom. At this week‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress, China doubled down on AI support, vowing to accelerate development in everything from intelligent manufacturing to large-scale AI models. The message? China isn‚Äôt playing catch-up‚Äîit‚Äôs leading the charge. That backing is why Alibaba has added $153 billion in market value since January, as investors race to get ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be a government-fueled AI gold rush.  
  
While China is firing on all cylinders, U.S. tech firms are struggling to keep pace. Meta and Amazon are pushing AI agent development, but Marvell Technology‚Äôs dismal earnings report highlighted growing concerns about America‚Äôs ability to maintain its AI edge. Factor in tariffs that are pressuring U.S. tech firms, and the balance of power in AI suddenly looks a lot more competitive than Silicon Valley would like to admit.

**China‚Äôs Not Just Catching Up‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Taking the Lead:**¬†For years, Chinese tech companies were seen as playing second fiddle to their U.S. counterparts. But with Alibaba‚Äôs AI breakthrough, government backing, and an aggressive investment spree, that narrative is shifting fast. It was thought that export control on chips sent to China would allow the US to maintain a 3-6 month lead in AI but this just shows it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs game.

# Alibaba Shares Soar After Chinese Tech Giant Unveils New DeepSeek Rival

**China just went all-in on AI, and Wall Street is taking notes.**

Alibaba sent shockwaves through the stock market after unveiling its latest AI reasoning model, QwQ-32B, a high-efficiency rival to OpenAI and DeepSeek. The news ignited a frenzy‚ÄîAlibaba‚Äôs Hong Kong shares spiked 8.4%, dragging China‚Äôs tech index up 5.4%, with Tencent and Kuaishou notching double-digit gains. Investors, it seems, aren‚Äôt just buying into Alibaba‚Äîthey‚Äôre buying into China‚Äôs AI dominance.

**The AI Arms Race Is Heating Up**  
  
China‚Äôs tech giants are rolling out AI models at breakneck speed. Tencent just introduced its open-source video model Hunyuan, Kuaishou launched its own AI-driven platform, and Manus AI debuted a ‚Äúgeneral AI agent‚Äù that claims to outperform OpenAI‚Äôs DeepResearch. Meanwhile, Alibaba is pouring $53 billion into AI infrastructure over the next three years, betting big that its latest model will cement its place at the top.

**China‚Äôs AI Push Is Government-Backed‚ÄîAnd It Shows**  
  
Beijing isn‚Äôt just watching from the sidelines‚Äîit‚Äôs fueling the AI boom. At this week‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress, China doubled down on AI support, vowing to accelerate development in everything from intelligent manufacturing to large-scale AI models. The message? China isn‚Äôt playing catch-up‚Äîit‚Äôs leading the charge. That backing is why Alibaba has added $153 billion in market value since January, as investors race to get ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be a government-fueled AI gold rush.  
  
While China is firing on all cylinders, U.S. tech firms are struggling to keep pace. Meta and Amazon are pushing AI agent development, but Marvell Technology‚Äôs dismal earnings report highlighted growing concerns about America‚Äôs ability to maintain its AI edge. Factor in tariffs that are pressuring U.S. tech firms, and the balance of power in AI suddenly looks a lot more competitive than Silicon Valley would like to admit.

**China‚Äôs Not Just Catching Up‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Taking the Lead:**¬†For years, Chinese tech companies were seen as playing second fiddle to their U.S. counterparts. But with Alibaba‚Äôs AI breakthrough, government backing, and an aggressive investment spree, that narrative is shifting fast. It was thought that export control on chips sent to China would allow the US to maintain a 3-6 month lead in AI but this just shows it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs game.

**China just went all-in on AI, and Wall Street is taking notes.**

Alibaba sent shockwaves through the stock market after unveiling its latest AI reasoning model, QwQ-32B, a high-efficiency rival to OpenAI and DeepSeek. The news ignited a frenzy‚ÄîAlibaba‚Äôs Hong Kong shares spiked 8.4%, dragging China‚Äôs tech index up 5.4%, with Tencent and Kuaishou notching double-digit gains. Investors, it seems, aren‚Äôt just buying into Alibaba‚Äîthey‚Äôre buying into China‚Äôs AI dominance.

**The AI Arms Race Is Heating Up**  
  
China‚Äôs tech giants are rolling out AI models at breakneck speed. Tencent just introduced its open-source video model Hunyuan, Kuaishou launched its own AI-driven platform, and Manus AI debuted a ‚Äúgeneral AI agent‚Äù that claims to outperform OpenAI‚Äôs DeepResearch. Meanwhile, Alibaba is pouring $53 billion into AI infrastructure over the next three years, betting big that its latest model will cement its place at the top.

**China‚Äôs AI Push Is Government-Backed‚ÄîAnd It Shows**  
  
Beijing isn‚Äôt just watching from the sidelines‚Äîit‚Äôs fueling the AI boom. At this week‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress, China doubled down on AI support, vowing to accelerate development in everything from intelligent manufacturing to large-scale AI models. The message? China isn‚Äôt playing catch-up‚Äîit‚Äôs leading the charge. That backing is why Alibaba has added $153 billion in market value since January, as investors race to get ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be a government-fueled AI gold rush.  
  
While China is firing on all cylinders, U.S. tech firms are struggling to keep pace. Meta and Amazon are pushing AI agent development, but Marvell Technology‚Äôs dismal earnings report highlighted growing concerns about America‚Äôs ability to maintain its AI edge. Factor in tariffs that are pressuring U.S. tech firms, and the balance of power in AI suddenly looks a lot more competitive than Silicon Valley would like to admit.

**China‚Äôs Not Just Catching Up‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Taking the Lead:**¬†For years, Chinese tech companies were seen as playing second fiddle to their U.S. counterparts. But with Alibaba‚Äôs AI breakthrough, government backing, and an aggressive investment spree, that narrative is shifting fast. It was thought that export control on chips sent to China would allow the US to maintain a 3-6 month lead in AI but this just shows it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs game.

# Earnings From Broadcom, Hewlett Packard, Costco & Kroger

**Broadcom**¬†skyrocketed 12.82% after proving that AI is still the golden ticket.

1j4s8qo_AVGO,AVGO,Thoughts on a couple of AVGO earnings trades,"I usually **invest** for the long term and don't gamble with short term options plays, but when the opportunity arises I do like to do an earnings play where I gamble a bit of money I'm willing to lose. 

AVGO reports today post market, currently trading at \~$190 down from $250, where last earnings is what took AVGO up \~40% (from $180 -> $250):

https://preview.redd.it/ww09bpsy91ne1.png?width=2528&format=png&auto=webp&s=3736c0a8d0705b41df07f5040e90e3edd4707dd9

Markets are currently implying a move of 8.7% or a trading range of $175-20

https://preview.redd.it/od7b86npb1ne1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d616e31a94c29c0deab66eb83393d7ef35403a0

I never try to predict which direction a stock will go, so lets look at both options: 

DOWN: AVGO is already down 25% from its ATH of $250, and it should have a bit of support around the $160-180 level.

UP: After last earnings AVGO popped to $250, where since then there was the deepSeek scare where people thought for a minute that processing power was no longer necessary to make progress in the AI field and most of the chips and energy stocks tanked. Personally I think that story was overblown as the quoted cost of $6M didn't include all the supporting infrastructure deepseek by chance already had. But also since then we've had earnings from most of the companies and they have mostly stabilized since. I'm not saying AVGO will pop tomorrow back to $250 and beyond, only that its a possibility. 

Strategy options: 

\+ Obviously you could buy a call/put, but the premiums are **super** high right now with the VIX \~20 and earnings today, and if the stock doesn't go the way you guess you'll lose all your money immediately. And in order to make a significant amount of money you'd need a large move, which its possible AVGO could move very little after earnings. 

\+ You can improve on the above by using a call/put spread, which is **a lot better** than just 1 option because you sell away all the low probability of success premium to another sucker whose gambling not investing. You can generally buy a vertical spread ATM for half of the spread, so its a strategy which will return 100% on the investment if the upper leg. So you could buy a $190-200 bull call spread for $5 and make $5 if AVGO pops $10. Statistically this is a crapshoot - its cointoss if it will make money, but 50% chances isn't horrible, and depending on your portfolio value could be worth a $500 gamble. 

**Personally I prefer higher probability strategies though, so lets discuss a bit of a complicated strategy but which has a much higher probability of success.**

\+ I can buy a $190-200 bull call spread for $5 for the potential to make $5 if AVGO pops 10$. Probability of making money - 50%. I can then buy a put ratio spread for a net credit, lowering the overall cost of the strategy. So I can buy a March 21 (3 weeks) 1x $180 sell 2x $170 put ratio spread, for a net credit of \~$1. So overall the position is a $400 debit. So again the strategy:

\-2x march 21 $170 put   
\+1 x march 21 $180 put  
\+1x march 21 $190 call  
\-1x march 21 $200 call

And note that I used the March monthly expiry instead of the tomorrow weekly expiry to give myself a little bit more time for the position to work itself out or adjust if necessary. So in terms of outcomes:

\- AVGO > $200 - I make $600.   
\- 184 > AVGO > 176 - I lose 0-$400  
\- 176 > AVGO > 164 - I make 0-$600  
\- 164 > AVGO < 160 - I lose 0-$400  
\- AVGO < 160 - **Here I start to lose >$400, and is the ""dangerous"" outcome.**

The thing is, with AVGO trading at $190, down from $250, **statistically,** if AVGO were to go down to $160, I would see that as a buying opportunity:

https://preview.redd.it/3j8f1qvpi1ne1.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=58e646064509a079a2b4dc3c0a990df77ae2ac57

Buying AVGO at $160 would be like buying AVGO 9 months ago. If you can go back 9 months in time on a company you like and think has a good future - its a good opportunity. And honestly - if AVGO were to go down below $160, I wouldn't buy it. I would take the $600 profit on the $180-170 bear put spread, and roll the short $170 puts either down to a 170-160 ratio spread, for the potential to make another $500 if AVGO continues going down, or just down and out to a lower and longer strike. And maybe add a bull call spread, because AVGO is now trading for >40% off its ATH, and statistically, it seems probable that its oversold. 

So that would be the strategy I would personally pursue. I'm not 100% I will actually make the trade but I'll at least track it and report back here for whoevers interested. 

What are your AVGO earnings plays?

1isv6xb_AVGO,AVGO,"Intel: TSMC & Broadcom Eye Key Assets, but Regulatory Hurdles Loom","* Intel is in early discussions with TSMC and Broadcom for a potential joint venture or acquisition.
* TSMC is exploring control over Intel‚Äôs Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.
* Broadcom is interested in Intel‚Äôs design assets, aligning with its growth strategy.
* Intel‚Äôs stock surged 24% last week but remains uncertain due to regulatory and deal structure risks.
* CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to maintain key control over its Foundry business if spun off.
* Intel has $50.7 billion in debt, and a deal could help reduce financial strain.
* Intel is in early discussions with TSMC and Broadcom for a potential joint venture or acquisition.
* TSMC is exploring control over Intel‚Äôs Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.

Intel has been at the center of takeover speculation, with reports suggesting Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking to acquire parts of the company. These discussions, still in the early stages, could result in a joint venture or asset sale that restructures Intel‚Äôs operations.

TSMC, which previously distanced itself from Intel, is now exploring a joint venture for Intel‚Äôs Foundry business. The feasibility study focuses on acquiring Intel‚Äôs chip plants, particularly its 18A process node and proprietary PowerVia technology. However, such a deal would require U.S. government approval. Reports suggest that the Trump administration supports the move, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick involved in the discussions. If finalized, TSMC might lead a consortium of investors, including private equity firms and semiconductor companies, to structure the acquisition.

Broadcom has reentered the picture with an interest in Intel‚Äôs design assets. CEO Hock Tan is known for streamlining businesses after acquisitions, and he could reshape Intel‚Äôs design segment, likely keeping Data Center & AI assets while selling off other divisions. If Broadcom proceeds, a possible scenario could involve selling Intel‚Äôs Client design business to a company like Qualcomm. This would be similar to Broadcom‚Äôs strategy after acquiring VMware, where it divested non-core business units to focus on profitability.

Intel‚Äôs stock jumped 24% last week, marking its best weekly performance in over two decades. The company is currently valued at around $102.19 billion, trading close to its book value. However, despite the market optimism, there are risks that could derail these deals. Regulatory approval remains a major hurdle, and CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to retain key control over any spun-off Foundry assets. If negotiations fail or the government shifts its stance, Intel‚Äôs stock could face downward pressure.

For now, the uncertainty surrounding these takeover discussions keeps Intel at a Hold rating. While a deal could unlock significant value, the complexity of regulatory approvals and deal structures makes it difficult to predict an outcome. Investors should remain cautious as discussions progress.

They noted that the restructuring process appears to be in its early stages, with the new administration at Intel pushing forward with the plans. The firm also anticipates that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will agree to be involved in managing IFS, under conditions that would be favorable to them.

1irey65_AVGO,AVGO,Broadcom and TSMC in Talks to Carve Up Intel‚Äôs Declining Realm,"According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, industry giants Broadcom $AVGO and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) are reportedly in talks to carve up Intel‚Äôs declining realm.

Intel, once the indomitable titan of the chip-making world, has been struggling to maintain its dominance and is now considering a major division. Broadcom is eyeing Intel‚Äôs chip design and marketing division, while TSMC is poised to take over Intel‚Äôs manufacturing arm. This potential dismantling could align Intel with the growing industry trend where companies focus on either designing or manufacturing chips, but not both.

It‚Äôs incredible to think that a company as big and important as Intel, a name synonymous with innovation and technological advancement, is now facing such a drastic fate. One day, it was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, and the next day, it looks like it might be divided and taken over. The market tilt is indeed ruthless.

The discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal offers have been made yet. However, Intel‚Äôs recent tribulations, including falling behind TSMC in advanced chip production and the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have left it in a vulnerable position.

It's fascinating to witness how the landscape of the semiconductor industry might shift if this deal goes through. What do you all think about this potential carve-up? Do you believe it will spell the end of an era for Intel, or could this be the rebirth it desperately needs?",2025-02-17,69,40

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

>we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 

* This is a major indicator that the AI chip boom is REAL and Broadcom is in the right place at the right time.
* **Hyperscaler Demand:**¬†Three major cloud companies (hyperscalers) are driving this growth, and Broadcom is working with two more.
* **Custom Chips are King:**¬†Google's Gemini uses Broadcom's custom chips (TPUs). This proves that specialized chips are essential for large-scale AI. Off-the-shelf just won't cut it.
* **VMware Integration:**¬†The VMware acquisition is successful and profitable.
* **Broadcom's Expertise:**¬†They're the best at designing and making these custom AI chips.

Broadcom is positioned to dominate the AI chip market, just like Nvidia. The growth won't be overnight, but the long-term potential is massive.

Here's the kicker: AVGO's revenue could potentially quadruple, yet the stock price is only up around 20% in the past month! **This means there's a HUGE gap between the potential future value and the current price.** AVGO is seriously undervalued right now.

**TL;DR:** AVGO is about to become a major player in the AI chip market. $60-90 billion in potential revenue by 2027 (possibly 4x growth or more), driven by custom chip demand from big cloud companies. TSM's earnings call confirms this is happening NOW. **The stock price hasn't caught up to the potential yet, meaning there's a lot of room to grow.** This could be the next NVDA.",2025-01-16,39,34

1hiw993_AVGO,AVGO,AVGO Price Manipulation? Observations from Today‚Äôs Trading Activity,"Hey guys,

I noticed what seems to be a clear example of price manipulation by hedge funds/market makers today, and I wanted to share my observations.

This morning, I added AVGO $227.5 Put (expiring today 12/20) to my watchlist. For context, AVGO‚Äôs ex-dividend date is Monday, Dec 23, meaning anyone holding shares as of today, Friday, Dec 20, will be eligible for a dividend payout of $0.59 per share‚Äîa decent amount.

Here‚Äôs what I observed on the 1-minute daily chart:
	
‚Ä¢	At exactly 3:50 PM EST, there was a 1M share sell order, which dropped AVGO‚Äôs share price from ~$226 to just over $220.
	
‚Ä¢	Then, at 4:00 PM EST, a massive 46.5M share green candle appeared, but the stock price barely moved.

Here‚Äôs my take: It seems like the price was deliberately manipulated down to $220.x by selling a relatively small number of shares (1M) to make a larger chunk (46.5M) more affordable. This allowed institutions to load up on shares just before the ex-dividend date to secure the hefty payout.

To add to the intrigue, the option I was watching suddenly spiked from $0.90 to $8.50 during this timeframe.

Am I understanding this correctly? Could this be a textbook example of price manipulation, or am I missing something? Would love to hear your thoughts and analysis.",2024-12-20,15,31

1hfldj9_AVGO,AVGO,From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let‚Äôs start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom‚Äôs impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention‚Äîsimilar to Microsoft‚Äôs current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It‚Äôs akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We‚Äôre likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here‚Äôs the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60‚Äì90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom‚Äôs ASIC solutions and NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC‚Äîbeing application-specific‚Äîcould offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn‚Äôt match Broadcom momentum.

1hfpel0_AVGO,AVGO,$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----,"Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one‚Äôs a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

This is a strong buy imho especially with guidance into 2027!!

# ServiceTitan Shares Soar 42% in Blockbuster IPO

The IPO drought may finally be lifting.¬†

ServiceTitan, a cloud software provider for home and commercial trades, made a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker $TTAN, with shares soaring 42% from their $71 IPO price to close at $101.¬†

The move gave the Glendale, California-based company a market cap of nearly $9 billion, offering a glimmer of hope for a tech IPO market that‚Äôs been in hibernation since 2021.

**From Plumbers to Public Markets**  
  
Founded in 2007 by two sons of tradesmen, ServiceTitan offers software tools to help electricians, plumbers, and landscapers manage scheduling, payments, and customer service. The company serves over 8,000 customers and generated $614 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, up 31% year-over-year, though it still operates at a net loss of $195 million.

The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in the company's growth potential, particularly as demand for its cloud solutions climbs. ServiceTitan‚Äôs cloud infrastructure business saw 52% year-over-year growth, cementing its position as a rising star in the tech sector.

**Navigating IPO Challenges**  
  
ServiceTitan‚Äôs road to the public markets wasn‚Äôt purely strategic‚Äîit was partially financial. A prior funding round included steep ""compounding ratchet"" terms, pushing the company to go public to avoid dilution penalties.¬†

he IPO raised $625 million, with a portion allocated to buy back preferred stock and pay off early investors. Despite the urgency, the IPO‚Äôs reception suggests strong market enthusiasm, with retail investors driving early gains.

**What‚Äôs Next for IPOs?**  
  
ServiceTitan‚Äôs debut isn‚Äôt just a win for its founders or venture backers like ICONIQ Growth and Bessemer Venture Partners‚Äîit‚Äôs a potential green light for other fintech and tech startups waiting in the wings. Analysts see the IPO as a sign that investor appetite for high-growth tech stocks is returning, even amid tighter monetary conditions.

For ServiceTitan, the next chapter includes leveraging its IPO proceeds to fuel growth, pursue acquisitions, and edge closer to profitability. As co-founder and CEO Ara Mahdessian noted, ‚ÄúInvestors value durable growth and cash flow positivity‚Äîqualities we‚Äôre proud to deliver.‚Äù

With the Nasdaq Composite closing at record highs and tech giants thriving, ServiceTitan‚Äôs IPO success might just be the spark needed to reopen the IPO floodgates.

# Echelon Of Earnings

**‚ö°Ô∏èBroadcom Powers Up on AI Hype:**¬†Broadcom‚Äôs latest earnings call was an AI lovefest, with the chipmaker reporting a jaw-dropping 220% surge in AI chip revenue, hitting $12.2 billion for the fiscal year. CEO Hock Tan wasn‚Äôt shy about the company‚Äôs future, forecasting a $90 billion addressable market for AI components by 2027. While the broader semiconductor business is feeling a bit sluggish, AI is doing the heavy lifting.¬†  
  
In Q4 alone, total sales reached nearly $14.1 billion, driven by the booming demand for AI processors and networking chips. Investors cheered, sending the stock up 14% in after-hours trading. Broadcom‚Äôs secret sauce? Two new hyperscaler clients and a growing AI infrastructure footprint that keeps it in the same conversation as Nvidia. ($AVGO)

**ü§òüèº Costco Keeps Rolling Despite Consumer Caution:**¬†Turns out, bulk-size everything is recession-proof. Costco smashed Wall Street‚Äôs expectations with a $4.04 per share profit last quarter, thanks to its die-hard member base and a strong showing from both food and discretionary sales. Same-store sales jumped 7.1%, and online sales played a starring role in the retailer‚Äôs continued growth.¬†  
  
Even as inflation forces some retailers to fight for scraps, Costco‚Äôs Kirkland brand and jumbo-sized deals are still luring customers through the doors. Seasonal items like furniture and jewelry are flying off the shelves, while food and groceries continue to edge out dining out. Investors liked what they saw‚ÄîCostco‚Äôs stock is up 50% year-to-date, with no signs of slowing down. ($COST)

ü•ä¬†**Adobe Faces the AI Critics:**¬†Adobe is finding out that even being a generative AI pioneer doesn‚Äôt guarantee smooth sailing. The company‚Äôs FY2025 guidance sent shares tumbling 13%, marking its worst day in two years. While Q4 results‚Äî$5.61 billion in revenue and $4.81 per share in profit‚Äîbeat analyst estimates, the future is less certain. Investors are jittery over competition from AI startups like OpenAI, which are encroaching on Adobe‚Äôs turf with creative tools that could siphon market share.¬†  
  
Adobe isn‚Äôt sitting still, though. Its AI tool, Firefly, has been integrated across key products like Photoshop and Premiere, logging a whopping 16 billion uses. Executives are betting on a new, higher-priced Firefly tier to boost margins in 2025. But Wall Street‚Äôs patience is running thin, with many still questioning whether Adobe can defend its position in an AI-driven world. ($ADBE)

# Amazon Adds 'Car Shopping' to Its Cart

Amazon is taking your online shopping spree to a whole new level‚Äîcars.¬†

The retail behemoth just launched¬†*Amazon Autos*, letting you shop for a Hyundai like you would for an air fryer. Except instead of a Prime box at your door, you‚Äôll pick it up at a dealership.

**The Details: Click, Scroll, Drive**  
  
Amazon Autos is debuting in 48 U.S. cities with Hyundai as its exclusive partner. Buyers can browse new models, customize trims and colors, estimate trade-in values, secure financing, and e-sign paperwork‚Äîall on Amazon‚Äôs platform. What you won‚Äôt get? Free two-day delivery. You‚Äôll still have to visit the dealership to drive off in your new ride.

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is throwing in a $2,300 gift card for purchases made before January 10. Think of it as gas money, or, knowing Amazon, a chance to stock up on Alexa devices for your car.

**Why It Matters: Bye-Bye, Dealership Drama?**  
  
Car buying is infamous for its soul-draining haggling. Amazon promises to take that headache out of the equation by showing transparent, haggle-free pricing at checkout‚Äîtaxes and fees included. Unlike Tesla‚Äôs direct-to-consumer model, Amazon keeps dealerships in the mix, playing the ultimate middleman. Hyundai dealers sell the cars; Amazon makes the process easier (or so they claim).  
  
Here‚Äôs the fine print: Amazon Autos is only offering new Hyundai vehicles‚Äîno used cars, no other brands (yet). Leasing and more expansive financing options are expected to roll out next year. Still, Amazon is clearly testing the waters, setting itself up as the one-click king of car buying.

**Bigger Picture: A New Gear for E-Commerce**  
  
This move isn‚Äôt just about Hyundai. It‚Äôs a clear sign Amazon is eyeing the future of car shopping, where the experience is more app-friendly than awkward-salesperson-at-a-dealership. Rivals like Carvana and CarMax should take note.

If Amazon pulls this off, imagine adding a car to your cart alongside your groceries.¬†

# Apple‚Äôs AI Ambitions Take Shape with Broadcom Partnership

Apple is stepping up its game in artificial intelligence, teaming up with Broadcom to create its first AI-focused server chip, code-named¬†*Baltra*. Slated for mass production by 2026, this custom silicon marks Apple‚Äôs latest move to reduce its reliance on Nvidia‚Äôs chips while carving out a space in the lucrative AI hardware race.

**Broadcom‚Äôs Boost**  
  
Broadcom shares climbed 5% on the news, reflecting the market‚Äôs enthusiasm for this partnership. Apple and Broadcom are reportedly prioritizing the chip's networking technology‚Äîa critical piece for handling the high demands of AI processing in the cloud. Apple is expected to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.‚Äôs (TSMC) cutting-edge N3P process for¬†*Baltra*.

This isn‚Äôt Apple‚Äôs first foray into chip design. The tech giant has successfully replaced Intel in its MacBooks with its in-house M-series processors, and now it‚Äôs channeling that expertise into server hardware to support AI applications.

**Catching Up in AI**  
  
While Apple has been slow to roll out generative AI compared to its Big Tech rivals, it‚Äôs starting to show signs of catching up. Recent¬†*Apple Intelligence*¬†features, including integrations for Siri and Maps, aim to leverage AI directly on devices. But for more compute-heavy tasks, Apple‚Äôs cloud infrastructure needs a serious upgrade‚Äîwhich is where¬†*Baltra*comes in.

**Broadcom‚Äôs Winning Streak**  
  
Broadcom has become a top beneficiary of the generative AI boom, with shares up 54% this year following a massive rally in 2023. The company‚Äôs role in Apple‚Äôs AI chip ambitions further solidifies its standing in a market that could grow to $45 billion by 2028.

While Apple‚Äôs efforts won‚Äôt dethrone Nvidia anytime soon, the company‚Äôs pivot toward in-house AI hardware signals a strategic move to future-proof its ecosystem‚Äîand ensure Siri doesn‚Äôt get left in the dust.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) steps into the inflation spotlight next, offering a look at how prices are trending for the companies behind the goods and services we consume. While the CPI tracks costs for consumers, PPI is a wholesale measure of inflation that provides critical insights into the broader economic picture, even if it doesn‚Äôt get as much buzz.

In October, PPI remained flat month-over-month and rose 1.8% year-over-year. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, jumped 2.8%. Economists are watching closely for November‚Äôs reading, expecting a slight moderation to 2.5% annually. Meanwhile, the Fed‚Äôs other priority‚Äîemployment‚Äîgets a check-in tomorrow with jobless claims data. Last week‚Äôs claims rose by 9,000 to 224,000, slightly above expectations but still below historical averages, and forecasts call for 221,000 new claims this week.

1fa2ai9_AVGO,AVGO,Broadcom says it will sell $12 billion in AI parts and custom chips this year,"Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.

Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.

Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:

Earnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected

Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected

Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.

Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.

The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.

Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google‚Äôs TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.

‚ÄúBroadcom‚Äôs third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,‚Äù Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom‚Äôs infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company‚Äôs VMware acquisition.

1f8spne_AAPL,AAPL,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

1f8spne_INTC,INTC,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

1dypf7g_NVDA,NVDA,"Given the context of NVDA, is AVGO undervalued?","Normally I wouldn't say a stock with P/E ratio of 75, with 20 years of growth built into the price, is any kind of undervalued. But in the context of the kind of numbers NVDA is trading at now, isn't AVGO in fact undervalued in comparison?

Because the thing with NVDA is all of their AI cards, especially the good ones require a lot of cooling, so you can't pack it into a smartphone. So if we say we are moving away from specific small AI models like a million parameters RELU6 that does one particular thing like image recognition, and another similar model for translation, and another one for voice recognition, etc, and into the realms of generalized billion parameters LLMs that can do everything. Then that also means we are moving away from the realm where you can run these AI models on your own phone, so you have to connect to some server somewhere, and then the cloud will run your request and send the results back to you.

I think Google is great at doing this, but a lot of people swear by Apple, or Microsoft, or Amazon. So then I thought instead of betting on one cloud to beat the rest because I like it better. Why not bet on the NVDA equivalent of clouds, and that would be Broadcom, AVGO.

If you are thinking, why AVGO instead of just buying NVDA. I think AVGO has lower risk and wider moat. On the one side is AMD, Intel, ARM, on the other side is Google, Meta, Amazon, either side have a pretty good chance of announcing something that could ruin NVDA the way Blackberry got wrecked by the iPone. How many people saw that one coming in the 2000s? In comparison, I don't see anybody being able to destroy Broadcom anytime soon.",2024-07-09,3,13

Absolute dividend growth monster. That said, such periods of outperformance are often followed by periods of underperformance. I don‚Äôt think AVGO is a bad stock, but I have a hard time seeing it repeat the run-up it‚Äôs had over the last 4 years and felt that my funds were better off elsewhere. Pigs get slaughtered.

Also sold out of IRM, another dividend darling. Gave up a 7.91% yield on cost after an equally impressive run over the last few years. Their dividend growth rate had slowed dramatically, and while I think they‚Äôve done a great job transitioning to data centers - the valuation also felt stretched and I‚Äôd rather not assume a ‚Äòbase case‚Äô of flawless execution over the next 3-4 years simply to justify the CURRENT valuation. Too rich for my blood.

With the market sitting at nosebleed valuations, and the Mag 7 making up like 2/3rds of all market returns in the last year, I‚Äôm transitioning most of the funds to USFR to relax on a cool 5.3% risk free yield.. paid monthly.. until the fed decides to cut rates (or doesn‚Äôt).

18acw3n_AVGO,AVGO,"Expected Moves this Week: SPX/SPY, QQQ, IWM, Broadcom, Docusign and more.","After a week and a half hovering around the 4550/455 level, SPX/SPY made a move higher late in the week. The index has been doing a bit of a stairstep higher the past 3 weeks, first pinning near 450 after a strong move higher then doing the same at 455. Now near 460, it's entirely possible the same thing happens at this level, but there are some things to keep an eye out for that could signal a pickup in vol. The first would be any sign of two-way moves. The SPX/SPY is currently in the midst of a historic run that has only seen 1 day the red of more than 0.5% in the past month. So clearly any move lower more than that, particularly one that sees an acceleration over a few days of larger moves lower would probably be a signal of a little bit of volatiliy returning. The other would be to the upside. It's worth keeping an eye on Russell 2000 / IWM as that has been showing some signs the past week of playing catchup to the move in QQQ. On Friday IWM was up nearly 3%. And IWM vol, as measured by the RVX was up 2%. That sort of rising stocks, with rising IV condition is noteworthy if it turns from more of a rotation from mega cap to small cap into FOMO buying and froth, with the potential that investors start reaching for out of the money calls. That's another way vol goes higher and it can mean some powerful moves higher in a lot of stocks, sometimes defying logic.

The big economic news of the week comes Friday with the NFP payrolls/jobs number. The earnings calendar is highlighted by Broadcom AVGO on Thursday. Vol remains extremely low with the VIX near 12.50 on Friday and 0DTE expected moves about 0.5% each day:

I have questions here.   Does this mean one can buy 20 shares of VMW @ $142.50 for $2850 and receive 5 shares of AVGO @ $978 , or $4890 ?

&#x200B;

Would one have had to do that last week?  As in if I buy shares tomorrow to play this arbitrage would the previous shareholder get to decide because of the 3 day settlement?   

&#x200B;

14ora88_NVDA,NVDA,"Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?","In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated. 

As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.

To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:

Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.

These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.

	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued.
	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation.
	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.

To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.

AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.

Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.

AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.

Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:

AVGO Annual Income Statement:

	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million
	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million

NVDA Annual Income Statement:

	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million
	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million

Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.

In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.

These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.

Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.

Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.

While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued.

zcmdv1_AVGO,AVGO,"Expected moves this week: Options pricing FOMC, Earnings from Lulu, Broadcom, Costco, Autozone.","## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì Fed comments still creating market moves**

SPY rose 1.2% last week, less than the 1.5% move options were pricing. The week featured more volatility than the final tally would indicate as it rose about 3.3% from the week‚Äôs lows following the positive rate hike comments by Powell on Wednesday. VIX futures are still steeply in contango with Dec around 21 and Feb near 25. SPY option IV is less steep with 30-day IV, 18, 60-day, 19, and 90-day, 20. Powell‚Äôs comments moved markets more than the Jobs number and that assumption continues with big volatility assumptions around the Dec FOMC meeting. More on that below.

&#x200B;

**This Week ‚Äì¬†Low IV for now, with options looking ahead to Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.3% move for the upcoming week.

Last week, we highlighted how the economic calendar was about to pick up in the first few weeks of December. The Powell speech was the highlight last week, with the Jobs number also seeing a big move lower before a late recovery. This week sees Producer Prices and Consumer Sentiment but the options market is already looking forward to Dec 14th. IV is low for the next week and a half and pricing much larger movement into and out of the FOMC decision. In fact, SPY options are pricing just a 1.5% move out to December 12th, with just 12 IV. Options pick up for the 13th, and the SPY options expiring on December 16th are 21 IV. This is something to keep an eye on for expiry dates and trading over the next 2 weeks as it will also show up in individual stocks (for instance, AAPL Dec 9 options are 22 IV and Dec 16th are 29). Here‚Äôs how it looks in SPY, something that looks more like a stock about to report earnings:

uw2wps_AVGO,AVGO,Broadcom (AVGO) acquiring Vmware (VMW)?,"Somehow analysts are saying this is a strategic fit.

Broadcom is an embedded chip maker primarily selling communications chips (wifi, cellular, Ethernet, etc).

Vmware is a virtual-machine software developer.

Virtual machines are used to isolate cloud instances on large servers.

They're both involved in internet technology, but metaphorically it's like a tire company buying a body-panel maker.

The only synergy surface is device drivers, but those are part of the operating system that would be run within the VM instance. There's very little to be gained from tuning the VM further.

So what is the reason to do this merger? And does it indicate a lack of hard investment opportunities for AVGO in its own business, and does that indicate big trouble for tech growth overall?",2022-05-23,27,28
s3ayvh_AVGO,AVGO,"AAPL and AVGO correlation, along with increasing Fed Rates","Okay, somebody school me here.  I have a theory, break it apart.  Educate me.  That's what we are mostly here for.

Fed Rates increase, makes it more expensive to borrow money and develop for businesses like AAPL.  Valuations drop, etc.

At one point, AAPL was considering developing their own semiconductors, wireless components, etc, that they currently outsource from AVGO.

With the fed increasing rates this year, does that have the potential to further solidify AAPL's dependence on AVGO for another year, making AVGO a good buy at sub $600 right now?

I remember reading a report that around 15 B or 20% of AVGO's business was from supplying AAPL.

But anyway, with the current climate and increasing fed rates this year (which might even be as low as 0.25% so potentially negligible), does it make it reasonable to assume that AAPL may hold off on spending on that semiconductor development for a while, making AVGO a pretty good shot at below $600 entry right now?

Hopefully I'm making sense here.  Completely hypotheticals.

Looking for some alternatives to NVDA due to the high P/E, and surprisingly AVGO seems to be a reasonable P/E at around 41.45.

lol I say all this as big tech is getting absolutely THRASHED.

So educate me fellas.  You guys think AAPL will press forward with their semiconductor development this year?  Or will they hold off due to increasing fed rates and stick even further with AVGO for the time being?",2022-01-13,1,21

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I‚Äôm using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I‚Äôm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *‚Äì The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication ‚Äî not a guarantee ‚Äî we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings‚Äô stock model projects a stock‚Äôs total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we‚Äôre avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company‚Äôs shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500‚Äôs +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We‚Äôre only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*‚ÄúA‚Äù Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Strong Buy****‚Äú.*

*‚ÄúB‚Äù rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Buy****‚Äú.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company‚Äôs financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

nwagwc_AVGO,AVGO,Thoughts on Broadcom (AVGO),"Recently did some research into Broadcom and I think it would be a good buy if it was down like 10% from here. I tried to use a DCF model and if I did it correctly then it's around it's intrinsic value and with it having a 3% dividend yield, growing free cash flow, trading at around 20 times free cash flow, and exposure to 5G, phones, and a growing software sector it makes me feel good.

Zoom, Broadcom, DocuSign, Cloudera, Macy's and more. A couple of big moves WAAAY beyond the expected move last week, notably CRM and ULTA. We hadn't seen a lot of those type of moves on earnings the past few weeks, so perhaps something is changing. Options seemed notably conservative last week in some high flyers, mostly because the overall market hadn't been moving much and the VIX was holding in the low 20's.

# Description

Broadcom Limited is a semiconductor company. The Company offers a range of products in end-markets, including wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial and others. The Company's products are used in various applications, including data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays. 

## Recent financials 

Given it's a merger, there aren't any official long term financials. And given they are in the process of [acquiring Brocade](http://investors.broadcom.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=203541&p=irol-EventDetails&EventId=5242448) too... it's going to get messier.

So let's look at the merger [presentation](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?t=1&item=VHlwZT0yfFBhcmVudElEPTUyNDI0NDh8Q2hpbGRJRD02NTEyMDE=) and take management at their word.

|Pro-forma 2016 Estimate|Broadcom|Brocade|Combined|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $16.6bn | $1.4bn | $18.0bn |
|Gross Margin | 61% | 77% | 62% |
|Operating Profit | $6.8bn | $0.8bn | $7.6bn |
|Operating Margin | 41% | 58% | 42% |

They go on to suggest that they can do a top-line growth of 5% and are aiming to expand margins to 45%. Net net that would translate to approx 10% growth at the bottom line.

## Brocade deal

They expect the deal to close in the 2nd half of 2017. 

> Acquiring Brocade, a leader in Fibre Channel storage area network (‚ÄúFC SAN‚Äù) switching and IP Networking, for $5.9 billion. Broadcom to retain Brocade‚Äôs FC SAN Switching business and divest Brocade‚Äôs IP Networking business including Ruckus Wireless

Is Broadcom becoming the Oracle of the semi business? Rolling up the sector to embed themselves in the end-client base and then get pricing leverage?

## Competition

> We compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications, including, but not limited to the following:

> * Broadband and Connectivity: Intel; Marvell; Mediatek; Qualcomm; STMicro
> * Infrastructure and Networking: Cavium; Freescale; Intel; Marvell; Mellanox

Though clearly it's Intel and Marvell that overlap the most.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Broadcom Ltd | $16,600M | 41% | -ve
Intel Corporation | $57,927M | 39% | 17%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,458M | 4% | -ve
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $6,781M | 18% | 3%
Cavium Inc | $478M | -9% | -ve
Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. | $813M | 15% | 6%

On the face of it, they are doing well. In line with Intel and Qualcomm. Who couldn't be happy about that. 

## Cash / Debt?

Broadcom Ltd has $11,754M of net debt. That is 4x it's latest operating profit. Though in the Brocade deal presentation they forecast 2x by the time the deal closes.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $204.66 for Broadcom Ltd and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 26% to their target. Sweet!

# Valuation

And the valuation isn't wildly off Intel or Qualcomm's, so hard to worry about that. It doesn't feel impossible to see the sector re-rate, if there are some earnings surprises...

|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AVGO.O | $64,681M | 14x | 15% | 1% | 5%
INTC.O | $159,989M | 13x | 10% | 3% | 15%
MRVL.O | $7,158M | 24x | 22% | 2% | 3%
QCOM.O | $94,757M | 14x | 11% | 3% | 11%
STM | $9,074M | 41x | 39% | 3% | 14%
CAVM.O | $3,642M | 35x | 29% | 0% | 1%
MLNX.O | $1,937M | 11x | 19% | 0% | 7%

...though trimming forecasts has been the recent trend, not upgrades.

# Dividends

Broadcom Ltd is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.79 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $11.25. So plenty of room to pay off debts, keep up the M&A and even do buybacks.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they said

> I would like to say it‚Äôs visibility to near-term projected demand remains very solid and we anticipate continued momentum into the fourth quarter. We expect the ramp in our wireless segment to drive consolidated revenue growth of 8% sequentially. We expect our operating leverage to drive earnings per share growth of 16% sequentially twice our projected revenue growth.

But when it came to the Brocade announcement

> Broadcom Limited Affirms Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Guidance and Tightens Revenue to Upper End of Range. 

:) 

So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range.

433v09_AVGO,AVGO,"BRCM, AVGO merger?","Now that the outcome has been determined, but apparently not yet published, Does anyone know approximately what BRCM holders who did not make an election will get in the merger?  
  
Early news reports said those not making an election were equal to making an election of 50% cash and 50% stock.  But later news reports (which I think means more accurate) said non election was equal to electing 100% cash.  
  
Early news reports gave the cash and stock rates of the merger ($54.50 and .4378).  Later reports leave that out.  Are those still correct?  
  
The most recent news reports say the 100% cash election was only slightly oversubscribed, by an amount that should imply 94.52% cash, or imply each share of BRCM (that did not elect stock) would get $51.51 cash plus each 125 shares of BRCM would get 3 shares of AVGO.  If AVGO is $123 when your broker aggregates and sells the fractional 3/125 shares, the cash you get from that would be $2.95 per BRCM share, in addition to the $51.51 direct.  
  
If you had 42 or more shares of BRCM, you would get one or more whole shares of AVGO, that your broker would not automatically sell (with the fractional shares).  So that extra $2.95 per BRCM share is only on the part that isn't whole shares from the 3 AVGO per 125 BRCM.  

Is my understanding of all the above roughly correct?  Or did I miss something important?  (I'm not expecting either that $51.51 or the 3/125 to be exactly correct, just wondering if the logic is right making each of those nearly correct).",2016-01-28,2,0
3f2mfe_AVGO,AVGO,The pain continues for semi-conductors. QRVO plunges nearly 17% afterhours. SWKS and AVGO fall as well.,"QRVO is down after-hours due to a cut in guidance. SWKS and AVGO fall in sympathy, as well as NXPI.

NXPI reports later this evening. AVGO next week. 

I made a thread earlier warning to stay away from these stocks. Looks like my suspicions were confirmed at least for the short term. 



EDIT: I think this shows that SWKS is clearly the very best of this group. Amazing fundamentals. Watch for SWKS to hit the 200ema. Last time that happened was October 2014 and it bounced right off sky high. If SWKS does indeed hit that 200ema again(I think its about $84 now and it may not get there), its the absolute perfect buying opportunity. This is of course all assuming that nothing changes for SWKS(revised guidance, etc). It is absolutely being unfairly beat up. This is a very competitive space so if you like to pick stocks, you need to go with the winners. QRVO is a loser.
