Often I find hard to buy it... Which sometimes ends in missed opportunities.   

(I bet that a lot of people considered MSFT expensive at 107$ in 2019).    

For me, one example from current market is **American Express $AXP** I believe it is a very nice company and value is fair, but the price has risen so much in the last 3 months...    
It doesn't look like the best moment to open a position. 

Also I think that being contrarian and buying at all time highs is a bit of a contradiction.... Would you say so?

1d2037m_AXP,AXP,American Express (AXP): What makes them stand out in the market against their competitors?,"Warren Buffett has held AXP stock since the early 1990s. For a long time though, Amex was seen as too exclusive, since it wasn’t accepted as widely as Visa and MasterCard. That’s certainly changed in recent years as more places than ever now take Amex. Certainly, those loyal to Amex praise their customer service and benefits.

Since June of 2023, AXP has shot up from 158 to 238. As of now, it’s still trading at a P/E of 19.6 (12.15 EPS). What makes it stand out, and what are the benefits and risks of AXP?",2024-05-27,153,50
1c5kn6x_AXP,AXP,The bearish case for American Express,"AXP-next earnings report on Apr 19, 2024

Higher for longer, good for AXP the company, bad for everyday individuals trying to survive in this high inflation environment. People usually charge any extra/miscellaneous expense to the cc with a hope it will be paid off later. Paying back credit cards is usually not the highest priority over rent and utilities.

Delinquency rates are starting rise and this is not good for lenders, especially those that lend at a super high interest rate: 20%+ interest.

I think any profits Amex makes from these high rates may be offset from the coming losses and charge offs on the credit card balances.

[https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240206](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240206)

“Credit card and auto loan transitions into delinquency are still **rising above pre-pandemic levels**,” said Wilbert van der Klaauw, economic research advisor at the New York Fed. “This signals increased financial stress, especially among younger and lower-income households.”

2008 started with sub prime borrowers.

The only things saving the banks and lenders at the moment is the super strong jobs market. If we start to see the unemployment rate rise, watch out. It usually starts slow then rises rapidly.

I'm bearish on all of the credit card companies. CC debt is over $1Trillion dollars at 20%+ interest. This is simply unsustainable. Theres too much credit risk out there between auto loans, CC balances, student loans, and commercial real estate. Oddly this time around residential mortgages are the MVP. ",2024-04-16,2,7

vbez2o_AXP,AXP,"Warren Buffett says these are the best stocks to own when inflation spikes — with consumer prices still surging, it's time to follow his lead - $CXV $AAPL $KO $AXP","[https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes)

Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs.

Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.

Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has [plenty of advice](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/5-top-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-shareholder-meeting) on what to own when consumer prices spike.

In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.

Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.

## American Express (AXP)

Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.

The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.

American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.

Business is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion.

American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion.

Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.

American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%.

 

## Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola is a classic example of a [recession-resistant](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/jim-rogers-warns-big-collapse-and-recession) business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.

The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.

Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.

Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion.

You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.

 

## Apple (AAPL)

No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.

Earlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.

While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.

Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%.

Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.

 

## Chevron (CVX)

One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.

Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.

It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.

Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/ukraine-invasion-protect-your-portfolio) could keep that trend going.

Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022.

The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%.",2022-06-13,23,25
usu6eg_AXP,AXP,Levered vs unlevered DCF analysis AXP,"Hi guys,

I'm a complete rookie when it comes technical analysis, so please go easy on me if that's a stupid question.

I was trying to find information on American Express (AXP) stock and came across this DCF analysis: [https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/discounted-cash-flow-model/AXP](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/discounted-cash-flow-model/AXP)

However, the *levered* DCF posits a vastly different valuation (equity value of 632 vs 77 (!) for the unlevered DCF): [https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/discounted-cash-flow-model-levered/AXP](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/discounted-cash-flow-model-levered/AXP)

My question is not whether these estimates are conservative or not, but rather why on earth does the levered DCF offer such a high valuation? Shouldn't levered DCF include interest payments and debt obligations? If so, shouldn't the number actually be lower? 

Thanks for any insights offered!",2022-05-19,3,1

American Express (NYSE:[AXP](https://www.investing.com/equities/american-express)) reported on Tuesday fourth quarter [earnings ](https://www.investing.com/equities/american-express-earnings)that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.

American Express announced earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $12.15B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.86 on revenue of $11.52B.

 ""Our investment strategy enabled us to reach record levels of card member spending ... increase new card acquisitions, grow our loan balances,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said in a statement.

The company expects the momentum to continue in 2022, estimating annual net revenue to grow between 18% and 20% and earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65.

American Express shares are down 2% from the beginning of the year, still down 15.92% from its 52 week high of $189.03 set on October 22, 2021. They are outperforming the Dow Jones which is down 5.43% from the start of the year.",2022-01-25,4,6

The company posted third-quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.27 a share, up from $1.1 billion, or $1.30 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.80 a share.

American Express’s AXP revenue net of interest expense grew to $10.9 billion from $8.8 billion, while analysts had been modeling $10.5 billion. Cardholder spending accelerated and was up 19% relative to the third quarter of 2019, the company disclosed in its release.

The stock is breaking ath as the earning report beats both top and bottom lines. As people keep going back to work, business travel have resume and will be going back to normal. This trend will benefit AXP as consumer spending rebound and the coming holiday seasons will boost AXP revenue as well.",2021-10-22,118,9
ppcdl6_AXP,AXP,$AXP why would you not invest in Credit Cards?,"There are so many reasons to invest in in Amex right now, it is beyond undervalued for the time we are living in now. Consumerism is at an all time high and $AXP is just inches away from soaring to its valued number. I would be shocked if it doesnt hit $200 by the end of the year.

It's increased in just the past year alone way above pre-covid numbers. Americans are buying so many things and keeping the credit card companies at bay while they are slowly collecting that sweet sweet interest money. 
I think now is the time to buy in the dip and ride the wave to $200 ++

They're all at extreme discounts given we may be going into even worse economic times over a long period which would obviously hurt all of these companies in a bad way, but they're also at incredible discounts. Are you personally looking into any of these companies and if so which one are you aiming for? Any advice you can give to a new investor on this industry as a whole? I fully expect for them to be hit very hard if the economy continues to shit the bed.

Seems Discover has the best net profit margins at 20% whereas the other two are 14 and 15%. 

Capitol One has 15% shareholder equity compared to 10 and 11% on Discover and American. 

Of course delinquency will rise due to coronavirus and high unemployment, but I don't think it'll be as bad as some might think due to the governments stimulus cheques to help out people. I think with the stimulus cheques it might encourage some people to continue making the bare minimum payments rather than just outright halting payments (of course many people will still do this).

Capital One dividend isn't too consistent and definitely iffy, Discover has a very solid dividend history and consistent growth and American Express over the last few years has been solid with their dividend as well, however at only a 2% (current) dividend yield compared to the other two at 4 and 5%. So far American has paid out dividends twice this year despite covid and Discover and Capital have both paid out their Q1 dividend with their Q2 dividends coming out next month.

Value | $75,051M

# 1. You know the brand, what about the company?

Amex's principal products and services are charge and credit card products, and travel-related services, which are offered to consumers and businesses around the world. 

They break the business into:

* U.S. Consumer Services, i.e. folks in the US with an Amex card
* International Consumer and Network Services = foreigners
* Global Commercial Services = businessmen
* Global Merchant Services, shops and businesses paying Amex a cut

Next let's look at the splits. 

|2016|Net Revenue|Income|Margin| No. of cards | Capital |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
US Consumers | $11.3bn | $2.5bn | 22%| 33m | $7.2bn |
International | $5.2bn | $0.7bn | 13%|  15m |$2.5bn |
Global Commercial | $9.2bn | $1.9bn | 21%|  14m |$7.0bn |
Merchant Services | $4.4bn | $1.5bn | 33%| n/a | $2.5bn |

So clearly the least exciting bit is international. What's wrong with ""American""! But maybe we shouldn't be so negative on the International unit, as to a large extent, Amex is outsourcing the international business with 150 partners do the card issuing to consumers and negotiations with shops in over 130 countries. i.e. they've only 15m Amex cards internationally but another 49m partner cards!

But overall the best margins and returns are from shops. It's no wonder lots of businesses refuse Amex.

## Bringing it all together:

The top line is flatlining at best. And although the bottom line is looking good, that's driven by buybacks, not by operational efficiency. In fact, one-off gains have boosted earnings a lot in each of the last 3 years.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $31bn | $33bn | $34bn | $33bn | $32bn|
|EPS | $3.89 | $4.88 | $5.56 | $5.05 | $5.65|

Now, I'm all for capital coming back to shareholders, but I'd like to see some growth too. In the annual report they wrote:

> In a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In 2016, revenue was lower year-over-year, though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. In addition, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Amex, please forgive me, but aren't you a mainly US business? Isn't the Great Recession nearly 7 years past?

# 2. Amex vs the rest

Visa and Mastercard really aren't fair comparisons, from a business model perspective, since they don't actually manage end consumers. They are more like the ""Merchant Services"" unit of Amex.. just 3 to 4 times bigger.

Maybe Paypal and Discovery ar worth a look, as they are brands in their own right, so on that front, we can probably cheer both margins and returns. 

|Operations|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
American Express Company | $32,517M | 25% | 24%
Visa Inc | $16,829M | 68% | 17%
Mastercard Inc | $11,064M | 57% | 75%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $11,273M | 21% | 10%
Discover Financial Services | $8,810M | 53% | 22%
Fiserv Inc | $5,568M | 35% | 35%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $7,341M | 24% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $3,870M | 21% | 12%
Square Inc | $1,791M | 0% | -17%

But it's when we get to valuation that the difference come clear. AXP and DFS are expect to be single digit growers. And it's reflected in the price. 

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
AXP | $75,051M | 15x | 8% | 2% |
V | $221,874M | 29x | 15% | 1% |
MA | $133,781M | 29x | 15% | 1% | 
PYPL.O | $65,336M | 31x | 17% | 0% | 
DFS | $23,526M | 10x | 9% | 2% | 
FISV.O | $26,348M | 24x | 12% | 0% | 
ADS | $14,621M | 14x | 12% | 1% | 
GPN | $14,010M | 23x | 18% | 0% | 
SQ | $9,091M | -128x | 20% | 0% | 

Perhaps the assumption is that the ""moats"" around V MA and PYPL are significantly deeper. And that Amex's brand just isn't that defensible long term. An assumption, I'd argue with!

# 3. What does Wall Street thinks?

Although Wall Street says _Buy_ it's hardly putting it's neck out with a $84 price target. i.e. no upside!

And at 15 times earnings, the stock's valuation has ramped to a two year high, all the way from just 9x earnings back in Feb 2016.

# 4. Clear your card?

When I read management transcripts, I don't get the impression that the Amex card is either in the soup or super. For example:

> Step in back, over the past several years we have embarked on a serious of initiatives to reposition the company drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts which we covered in Investor Day, include, amongst others, focusing on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets on our global commercial segments, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant network and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These action for targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer-term.

It feels very ""pedestrian"". Sure, I'll get some cash back in divides and appreciation with buyback. But it's hard to get excited. 

The card may be Platinum, but not the stock.
