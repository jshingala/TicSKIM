1kr3p1m_BAC,BAC,"Moody’s downgrades JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo in blow to U.S. banks","
Moody’s Ratings on Monday downgraded the long-term ratings of several of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), citing weakened prospects of federal support following Friday’s U.S. sovereign downgrade. The move marks a rare blow to the top tier of the U.S. financial system and may raise borrowing costs and regulatory pressure on institutions still seen as systemically important.

The rating agency lowered deposit ratings, senior unsecured debt, and counterparty risk assessments for key subsidiaries and branches of the banks to Aa2 from Aa1. These ratings had previously included a notch of uplift tied to the government’s Aaa rating, support Moody’s no longer deems as fully credible following the downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt to Aa1.

“The downgrade of the US Government’s rating indicates that it has less ability to support the US’s global systemically important banks,” Moody’s said. “The ratings and assessments downgraded in today’s action all previously incorporated one notch of US Government support uplift and this notch of support has now been removed.”

1ff8bwh_BAC,BAC,Investment Thesis: $BAC,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent moves and thoughts on $BAC (Bank of America). I sold, but I’m still holding onto some shares. Here’s my reasoning:

**Thesis:** Warren Buffett recently sold a large position in $BAC. To me, this signals one of two things: either $BAC is at its peak, or Buffett is preparing cash for a significant purchase. Given his track record, I think it’s worth paying attention.

**Actions Taken:**

* Sold some $BAC
* Moved the funds to my dividend portfolio to build a cash position.
* Still have exposure to $BAC through direct ownership and ETFs. and BRK-B
* Holding onto $BRK-B for the long term.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on $BAC and Buffett’s recent moves. Do you think $BAC has peaked, or is there another reason for his sale? How are you positioning your portfolios in response?

Looking forward to the discussion!",2024-09-12,0,3

1e4lsyl_BAC,BAC,Bank of America tops estimates on better-than-expected investment banking ,"Bank of America on Tuesday said second-quarter revenue and profit topped expectations on rising investment banking and asset management fees.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: 83 cents a share vs. 80 cents a share LSEG estimate

Revenue: $25.54 billion vs. $25.22 billion estimate

The bank said profit slipped 6.9% from the year earlier period to $6.9 billion, or 83 cents a share. Revenue climbed less than 1% to $25.54 billion.

How is Bank of America navigating the interest rate environment?

That’s a key question after CEO Brian Moynihan told investors in April that net interest income would bottom in the second quarter.

The measure, known as NII, is the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays depositors for their savings. It’s one of the main ways that banks earn money.

Wells Fargo shares fell on Friday when it posted disappointing NII figures, showing how much investors are fixated on the metric.

1dlb1s3_BAC,BAC,"Regulators hit Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America over living will plans","KEY POINTS

* Banking regulators on Friday disclosed that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.
* The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills of Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America filed in 2023 were inadequate.
* Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios; derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

Banking regulators on Friday [disclosed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240621a.htm) that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills — plans for unwinding huge institutions in the event of distress or failure — of [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) and [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) filed in 2023 were inadequate.

Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios. Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, [according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.

“An assessment of the covered company’s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm’s capabilities have material limitations,” regulators [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) of Citigroup.

The living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.

While JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America’s plans were each deemed to have a “shortcoming” by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious “deficiency” by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn’t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.

Since the Fed didn’t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious “shortcoming” grade.

“We are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,” New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.

“While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,” the bank said. “More broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.”",2024-06-21,108,7

Banking regulators on Friday [disclosed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240621a.htm) that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills — plans for unwinding huge institutions in the event of distress or failure — of [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) and [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) filed in 2023 were inadequate.

Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios. Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, [according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.

“An assessment of the covered company’s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm’s capabilities have material limitations,” regulators [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) of Citigroup.

1dcelvx_JPM,JPM,Bank of America overvalued? ,"High interest rate environment has been pretty good to banks in the past year, posting strong earnings every time. Q1 earnings JPM gave mediocre guidance and stock dropped 6%, Citi, Bank of America, and Well Fargo all three beat earnings and left guidance mostly unchanged. All four bounced back after the market correction finished. All except BAC are lagging behind SPY since May 1st, JPM up 4.4%, C barely up, WFC -1.95%, but BAC is up 7.6%. All except BAC are trading slightly above or just above their 50-day EMA, with JPM trading \~2% above and BAC trading 4.5% above.

So my question is that if Q1 earnings and outlook are so similar for all 4 major banks, and they generally all do the same thing, why is BAC stock up so much more and seem overextended compared to the other 3? I understand that Warren Buffet holds $35bn of BAC stock but he has since 2007 and his last purchase was in 2023. Is it solely because of his name or am i missing something here?

19drm25_BAC,BAC,BAC Preferred Stock,"I was thinking of buying some BAC preferred stock (BAC PRS). My reasoning is that :

\- It has a really good yield  5.63% at the time of making this post.

\- If the fed cut rates, then the price of the stock should increase because it acts more like a bond.

\- It won't be callable until  02/17/2027.

\- BAC is one of the biggest banks in USA. They've managed to survive the financial crisis and they have improved a lot since then.

The stock is not convertible like (BAC PRL), but that trades at a premium and I don't think BAC is going to surpass 50$ any time soon. 

Also the stock is not cumulative which is the biggest downside in my opinion, but there aren't any cumulative options anyway.

So what's your opinion on the stock, do you own it?",2024-01-23,1,5

17chg7a_BAC,BAC,SBF vs BAC,"I want to hear your thoughts. I get the media noise calling SBF and Ellison hall of famer fraudsters the like we haven't seen since Madoff. The trading ""geniuses"" at FTX gambled w/ depositor money losing ppl billions; w/ no risk hedging whatsoever and lost it all.

Now, I look at BAC's balance sheet and see that burning $140B bond paper loss hole they dug themselves into thanks to taking in pandemic stimmy deposits and gambling it all on bonds at an all-time low yield with little to no rate/inflation risk hedging.

I think to myself how is this not the same BS that went on at FTX? But just because BAC gambled on the official Disney Bucks of the US (that can be magicked out of thin air) they're ok and no exec is in trouble..?

BAC is even worse I'd say, in fact. Cause even if the rates keep skyrocketing and that 140B hole getting bigger and bigger, BAC will never end up going bankrupt cause the Fed will ride to their rescue on the QE white horse the moment it looks like it'll burst at the seams; at the expense of the American taxpayer ofc.

I'm not advocating SBF's innocence, he's clearly a criminal and should go to prison, but why just stop at him? To me this looks like he's just being scapegoated to make it look to the American ppl feel the govt is guarding their financial interests when they're actually not.

I find it hard to not agree with SBF's comment that his biggest mistake in the FTX saga actually was declaring bankruptcy (not the criminal behavior). If he had been smart he'd have used his political bribe connections to parlay himself into a depositors' insurance deal with the Fed Govt and gotten himself into the inner circle.

Since the 2008 GFC, we have long known that the govt actually rewards, not punishes, this criminal behavior by letting you make degenerate bets and keep the profits if successful, or stepping up to cover the gambling bill on someone else's dime if bust. You just have to be part of the inner circle and keep the house of cards looking passable.",2023-10-20,7,17

&#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

The google sheet is open to everyone, and to get full access all you need to do is click the link at the top then in the top left of the sheet click File -> Make a Copy

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",2023-07-21,53,23
14ws4hc_BAC,BAC,Bank of America accused of opening fake accounts and charging illegal junk fees,"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/investing/bank-of-america-fake-accounts/index.html

Federal regulators accused Bank of America on Tuesday of harming customers by double-dipping on fees, withholding credit card rewards and opening fake accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

Some of the allegations are reminiscent of the Wells Fargo scandal last decade that involved opening millions of bank accounts without customer authorization. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust. The CFPB will be putting an end to these practices across the banking system.”",2023-07-11,1869,339

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

13pu5z5_BAC,BAC,Another LEAPS Call Post: BAC,"Back again everyone,

I'm looking through some screeners of stocks that are down off their highs and have potential for some growth (or at least no decline!) in the next \~1.5 years. Would get a DITM LEAPS Call and sell PMCC during to mitigate risk and lower cost basis.

BAC seems to fit this mold relatively well. Or at least I think. Which is why I'm here...

Pros:

* BAC has definitely been affected by the recent bank crisis and will likely spring back once the end of political theater of the debt ceiling and depositor calm washes over the land.
* Relatively low IV (again I think, please correct me if I'm wrong) of \~46 for a LEAPS call expiring in 2025
* Rates likely to stall/fall in the next few years and very likely to do so before 2025, causing the economy to grow and bank lending to increase
* Warren Buffet is largest owner of BofA and obviously has phenomenal track record (don't like using this as a pro, but when arguably the greatest investor of all time says he likes the stock, the stock is liked)
* According to this ([Bank Of America Cash on Hand 2010-2023 | BAC | MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/cash-on-hand)) BofA has around 1T in cash as of March 31, 2023; likely more than enough to cover any bank runs (and if not the government would likely bail them out anyway or they would get acquired by JPM 😑)
* Overall solid company with good track record
* Down about 26% off the 52 week high

Cons:

* We are in a turbulent financial situation. If debt ceiling isn't resolved, could lead to some massive hits, especially in the banking sector
   * Mitigants: It's likely political theater, a LEAPS would likely give ample time for it to bounce back if it's not, sell covered calls during to mitigate any catastrophe in the meantime.
* Potentially high IV could lead to an IV crush? Not 100% sure so please someone tell me if I'm dumb.
* High recession risk.

Obviously wouldn't want to get it on a day like today where it's popping but wait for a drawback and see what happens.

Again, I am just some dude being a dude and looking to get into a LEAPS/PMCC...please tell me if this is a logical and well-thought-out plan or a recipe for disaster.",2023-05-23,1,16

12xyx3v_BAC,BAC,"10K Risk Trend Analysis FRC,SCHW, SVB, BAC","This is an update to include First Republic (FRC) and Schwab (SCHW).

It analyzes the trend in the 10K Item 1A Risk Factors by examining 10 years of 10Ks. The goal is to see if a ""bigger picture"" is helpful in determining areas of the Risk Factors to examine more closely.

The way this analysis works is by counting all the individual risk item headlines and examining trends.

To start off here are the total counts for 2022 compared to 2012:

ITEM 1A RISK FACTOR TOTAL COUNTS

|Security|2022|2012|
|:-|:-|:-|
|FRC - First Republic|56|53|
|SVB - Silicon Valley Bank|45|27|
|SCHW - Schwab|26|17|
|BAC - Bank of America|26|30|

What I think is interesting is that First Republic is the clear and consistent leader in the number of disclosed risk factors for this comparison. Coming a close second is Silicon Valley Bank. So from just the magnitude of risk factors listed FRC and SVB have the ""most"" disclosed risk factors. I think this is helpful because it clearly shows that the companies believe there is more risk in what they are doing and thus need to disclose it.

Next I thought it would be interesting to examine how the Risk Factors have changed over time to see if trends show up. One note - from a previous post analysis I did I found an error in my calculation and corrected it below.

&#x200B;

ITEM 1A RISK FACTOR PERCENT CHANGE COMPARISONS

|Security|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|10 Year|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FRC - First Republic|2%|0%|\-3%|6%|
|SVB - Silicon Valley Bank|5%|18%|25%|67%|
|SCHW - Schwab|0%|0%|53%|53%|
|BAC - Bank of America|\-16%|\-13%|\-10%|\-13%|

SVB has the highest increases in the number of risk factors in every time period except one. For the 10 year change SVB had an increase of 67% in risk factors. In comparison FRC had only a 6% increase over 10 years. This makes it seem like the amount of risk was not that great for FRC, however as we have seen, it had the highest number of risk factors that stayed stable over this timeframe. The risk factors for SVB keeps increasing even through the 1 year timeframe. Bank of America in comparison actually decreased the number of risk factors.

&#x200B;

One other way I thought was also interesting to look at the risk factors was to separate it based on if it actually had happened. This can be done by examining which risk factors contain words saying it had/has/have happened instead of may, could, might, etc... This removes the statements that seem to cover every possible risk to focus on statements of risk that actually happened.

&#x200B;

ITEM 1A REAL RISK FACTOR PERCENT CHANGE COMPARISONS

|Security|1 Year|3 Year|5 Year|10 Year|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FRC - First Republic|16%|16%|22%|22%|
|SVB - Silicon Valley Bank|22%|175%|450%|1000%|
|SCHW - Schwab|\-10%|50%|80%|29%|
|BAC - Bank of America|0%|0%|\-33%|0%|

The risk trend becomes much clearer with this lens. SVB has dramatically increased it's real risk as the 10 year was an amazing 1000% increase. SCHW's growth rate is second highest, with FRC at third. BAC interestingly had 0% or negative change.

So the next logical question to me becomes what's driving these changes?

 Again I thought it would be useful to start by looking at a higher level and see if any useful trends could become apparent. I did this by categorizing the risk factors. The banks like to use 4 main categories so I used those: Market & Liquidity Risks, Strategic Risks, Operational Risks and Government & Regulation Risks. Each risk factor was put into one of these corresponding categories to allow for an apples to apples comparison.

&#x200B;

ITEM 1A REAL RISK FACTOR PERCENT CHANGE COMPARISONS

10 YEAR RISK COMPARISON

&#x200B;

|Security|Market & Liquidity|Strategic|Operational|Government & Regulatory|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FRC - First Republic|33%|33%|11%|33%|
|SVB - Silicon Valley Bank|200%|200%|500%|100%|
|SCHW - Schwab|100%|\-33%|300%|\-50%|
|BAC - Bank of America|0%|0%|100%|\-100%|
|Average|83%|50%|228%|\-4%|

&#x200B;

This data shows that SVB & SCHW & BAC had it's clearest risk factor growth due to Operational risk factors. These combined to give the Operational category the highest risk factor growth for all of these banks. FRC interestingly had pretty even risk growth across these categories. 

In summary I think this is a useful way to examine the risk factors vs just reading it straight in the 10K.

It starts by looking at risk factor trends at a macro view then allows you to examine it in different ways. Instead of just reading the Risk Section you can identify trends and focus in on areas that are changing.

Drawbacks - I think are that it doesn't account for the timing of the risk. For example, FRC had the same risks for pretty much 10 years but the eventual effect only seemed to happen with a combination of SVB and the Fed. Ideally, I'd want someway to highlight potential factors that would trigger the risk.

If you find this approach valuable let me know what other companies you'd like to see or analysis done - just post in the comments. 

Lastly, I'm also thinking about providing this as an ongoing service - if you have any thoughts about the value of doing that please let me know in the comments.",2023-04-24,6,13

Basically from my 3 minutes of research I've determined that banks make more monies from interest rates going up and banks have been pretty beat up lately, and Bank of America ($BAC) is a bank stock that hasn't already had a massive shrek candle like ($JPM), also from this healthy pullback I've also gotten an alert on my stock indicator that we going up soon. Anyways yeah, game plan on Tuesday is to go all in on $BAC stonk and buy as many shares as possible, also the stock bounced off resistance recently and just looks like it's going to go higher and break the 200 day moving average, earning have also been ight, that's about it tbh, uh what else, oh yeah I'm not a financial advisor. My price target is $34.5, a roughly 4% return from the current $33.18 per share price. I expect this price target to be hit within 1-2 weeks, stop loss will be at $32 per share or roughly a -3.5% decrease from the current price. If you have a big boy account just buy shares, if you want to leverage and go with options I recommend buy the  **BAC $34 Call 1/27/2023** option. Keep in mind the only thing that could ruin this trade is if the S&P 500 decides to crash, I doubt it will, but who knows. As such I'm going to just stick to buying shares with my stop loss, however if I were to go with buying the options I wouldn't buy heavy and I'd be mentally prepared to lose it all or use a -50% stop loss, the call options are pretty cheap right now.

Good for shareholders: getting more bang for your buck than with a share buyback (saving money on what is essentially an interest-bearing liability—the average dividend on them is somewhere north of 5%—and increasing book per share at a higher rate than with buybacks, all at the same time).

I suspect this may start to be a trend among the major banks, as the preferreds will in many cases trade below liquidation value on the open market, while the stock trades above TBV in many instances (BAC is trading at a 1.7 multiple).  Certainly seems to be a more prudent use of capital.

* Berkshire’s operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.
* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.
* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter’s market turmoil, however.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate’s operating earnings — which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities — totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company’s utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA’s expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire’s equity investments amid the market’s rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is “usually meaningless.”

Shares of Buffett’s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&P 500′s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

* **Bank of America’s customers continue to spend freely, using their credit cards and other payment methods for 10% more transaction volume in September and the first half of October than a year earlier, CEO Brian Moynihan said.**
* **Customers’ account balances remain higher than before the coronavirus pandemic struck in early 2020, Moynihan said, indicating that they were in a good position to continue spending.**
* **Finally, consumer credit remains pristine, with late-payment metrics still well below pre-2020 averages, indicating that so far, customers have had little difficulty keeping up with their debt.**

 

Consumers are financially resilient, despite high inflation and concerns the U.S. is nearing a recession, according to [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) CEO [Brian Moynihan](https://www.cnbc.com/brian-moynihan/).

""Analysts might wonder whether the talk of inflation, recession and other factors could \[result\] in a slower spending growth,"" Moynihan said Monday during a conference call to discuss [third-quarter results](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/17/bank-of-america-bac-q3-2022-earnings.html) that topped analysts' expectations. ""We just don't see \[that\] here at Bank of America.""

The bank's customers continue to spend freely, using their credit cards and other payment methods for 10% more transaction volumes in September and the first half of October than a year earlier, Moynihan said. While price inflation accounts for some of that, the number of transactions also rose 6%, he said.

Customers’ account balances remain higher than before [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) struck in early 2020, Moynihan said, indicating they were in a good position to continue spending. That is especially true for those who had the smallest balances, which were about five times higher than before the pandemic, according to a Bank of America [chart](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b81b10e3b00ca2879952e619db1e9a62/bankofamerica/db/806/9760/presentation/The+Presentation+Materials+3Q22.pdf).

Finally, consumer credit remains pristine, with late-payment metrics still well below pre-2020 averages, Moynihan said, indicating that so far, customers had little difficulty keeping up with their debt.

“We’re just now seeing \[a\] gradual move off these lows in early stage delinquencies; late-stage delinquencies are still 40% below pre-pandemic,” Moynihan said.",2022-10-18,92,97

wvxuo0_BAC,BAC,"Bank Of America Warns Of ‘Textbook’ Bear Market Rally, Predicting New Lows For Stocks","Though stocks have mounted a stunning comeback from June lows as investors grow more optimistic about cooling inflation and the Federal Reserve potentially scaling back interest rate hikes, the recent rebound is nothing more than a “classic bear” market rally which is likely to hit new lows, according to analysts at Bank of America.

The summer stock market rally looks to be almost over, according to a recent note from Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who points to data suggesting that recent gains are a “textbook” bear market rally which is poised to soon run out of steam.

The S&P 500 has jumped more than 15% since hitting a low point for the year in mid-June, in large part thanks to better-than-expected economic data—including a strong jobs report and cooling in consumer prices—in recent weeks.

Despite investor hopes that the worst has passed after a brutal selloff in the first half of 2022, analysts at Bank of America are among experts ramping up warnings in recent weeks that stocks still have further to fall.

“Everyone is bearish but no one has sold stocks,” Hartnett says, pointing to irrational trading activity in meme stocks and adding that after four straight weeks of gains, the market is showing many characteristics of what is likely to be a “self-defeating rally.”

The Bank of America analyst points to the fact that out of 43 bear market rallies since 1929 in which the S&P 500 gained over 10%, the average increase is roughly 17.2% over 39 trading days—meaning that the current rally appears to be maxed out, according to historical data.

What’s more, even after increasing the federal funds rate by 2.25% so far this year, the Federal Reserve is “nowhere near done” with rate hikes to combat inflation, he warns, which will likely put a ceiling on recent market gains.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR:

Other analysts at the firm have issued similar warnings in recent days. Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that stock market valuations remain far too high for the bear market to be over. A sustained bull market remains “unlikely,” she wrote, citing indicators that instead signal a looming end to the recent bear market rally.

SURPRISING FACT:

A bear market rally tends to “always narrow” in terms of leadership, Hartnett adds, pointing to the fact that the likes of Apple, Amazon and Tesla have accounted for outsized portions of the market’s recent rebound. Those three stocks have each risen by more than 30% since the market low point on June 16, far outpacing the benchmark index.

Bank of America (BAC) chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says the market's recent gains is a “textbook” bear market rally which is set to soon run out of steam. The S&P 500 has rallied 15% since the lows of June.

In 2012 the book value per share was $20.24 but the stock price went even below $5 in 2011. 

Investors were pessimistic about the bank’s earnings in a low interest environment, legal issues and financials were still a scary environment for most after the 2009 financial crisis. 

Nevertheless, a bottom up investor would focus on the book value, the small dividend and the history of the bank. 

Now, 5 years later, the stock price has reached and surpassed its book value as the bank eventually increased both its earnings and the dividend. 

The point is that if a company has significant tangible value, there is also a high probability that those assets will deliver quality earnings somewhere in the future. Therefore, a bottom up approach to investing always helps. 

The funny thing is that now, as BAC’s stock price is above its book value, most investors are starting to once more take a top down approach to this investment by thinking about the impact of higher interest rates, lower taxes, possible dividend increases, mergers and other euphoric factors while disregarding the stock’s book value and margin of safety.”",2022-08-12,1,4

**Last Week –** The **SPY** was essentially unchanged last week although it saw intra-week moves of close to 1.5% in either direction. Options were pricing about a 1.3% move.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move (about $7 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $464 that is a range of about $458 to $472.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 19. That level is about in line with historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* QQQ **2%** (about $8)

* DIA **1.2%** (about $4.50)

### In the News

We’ve highlighted the 15% or so range (in either direction) that **TSLA** stock has traded in since its breakout in October 2021. The stock has found resistance at the $1200 level and support near $900. The stock finished last week near the center of that range. The company reports earnings Wednesday Jan 26th. Here’s a look at an Iron Condor in the Feb 18th (monthly) expiry. The short strikes of the fly set at the recent support and resistance. You’ll note that is roughly in line with the expected move options are pricing. The risk/reward of the $5 winged Condor is about 2.70 to 2.30. In other words, options are pricing a move to recent support or resistance for earnings, and a breakout or breakdown would mean options were underpriced into the event. (via Options AI):

Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. 

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

This stock has surged 70% from march 2020 lows and is continually able to post strong financial Quarters. They have smashed it in the previous two Quarters Q1 & Q2 posting a surprise in earnings. In Q1 they posted earnings of .86 which was .20 higher than the expected of .66. And same story in Q2 were they posted earnings of 1.26 which was .26 higher than expected.

With BAC seeing a lull in volume this could be a perfect time to jump on. I have previously done positions in BAC and have road the wave from $25-40 where I took profits. I am using some of those profits to jump back into BAC because I LIKE THE STOCK.

My option play is that I have Bought 5 options strike at 42 that are set to expire Sep 17 for .41. With that being said I have set my stop loss on the lower white line. Like all the coke that I do. Since I have bought 5 call option I will have different areas of exit.

oibls8_JPM,JPM,"Expected moves. SPCE, TSLA JPM, GS, BAC, WFC and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.8%**
* DIA **1.2%**

&#x200B;

### In the News

The Virgin Galactic flight with Richard Branson went off successfully. **SPCE** options are pricing about a **22%** move for this week.

There was a lot of attention paid to **Tesla TSLA** chart technicals and momentum last week. Here’s how the options market is pricing TSLA, with a one week expected move of more than **4%** and a one month expected move (that includes earnings) of about **12%.**

Seems odd to announce a $25 billion stock buyback that won't even start for another 10 months.  But maybe thats the soonest they're allowed to start?  🤷‍♂️",2021-06-29,14,7

o24v5k_JPM,JPM,"JPM, C, BAC, WFC, et al - Easy Money on Call Options?","Banks are taking a significant hit today and it's not clear to me that there's a rational reason for it.  Not only should these stocks recover pretty quickly, but they have a pretty notable catalyst on the horizon with the Fed's stress testing results coming in and an anticipated easing of financial restrictions.

At-the-money call options for late July are pretty cheap on most or all of these tickers.  I plan on buying some before close today and I think an 80-100% profit on them is almost certain by early July.

Does anyone have a reality check for me?

EDIT: for posterity, I opened 40% of my intended position before close on Friday.  $40 9/17 WFC calls.  My thinking on WFC being that they have essentially the same catalysts for recovery as any other major bank with the added possibility of positive news on the lifting of their asset cap, which could come at any time.",2021-06-17,27,59

Given this why is the PE so low??  I looked at BAC which has relatively low to stagnant growth but a PE of 18. What gives?  Am I missing something? Or is the market just shy around CFBK because of the smaller market cap?
I’ve owned this stock for about 5 months now and I am up 7%. The stock is trending up which is good but I really don’t understand why the PE is so low.

njebtz_JPM,JPM,"ALLY Financial (ALLY) verse traditional banks (BAC, WFC, C, etc)","Ally Financial (ALLY) has recently gained some popularity over the past few years. They have 2 main streams of revenue, personal banking and auto financing.

I'm personally drawn to this stock because of the personal banking. I bank with Ally and I really like it so far. Great saving rates, no fees, super user friendly app, great customer service, etc. What's interesting is they don't have physical locations. At first I was concerned about this, but, I haven't ran into issues.

To my knowledge the personal banking is relative new and growing. Recently they have entered into the investing world as well. I'm sure this will increase their onboarding.

They seem to have a good culture, the valuation is attractive considering the smaller size and growth, and they offer a dividend. Overall I like the company.

I think this could be a big win in a few years if they keep onboarding users. Ally is a ""cool new bank"" that is attractive to the younger generation. I understand doubling the user base will not happen over night but I can see consistent growth.

To get an idea of their size relative to other big banks, I'll list a few market caps of well known banks and Ally's below:

ALLY: 20B

WFC: 190B

BAC: 363B

C: 160B

JPM: 492B

Questions that I have:

The savings rates for Ally are higher than many other banks, how do they accomplish that? Lower margins?

Can they actually compete against the ""big banks""?

Do they operate differently? If so, how?

### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** The **SPY** closed last week at new highs, up more than **2.5%** on the week, a move well beyond the **1.1%** move options were pricing. Despite that outsized move, market implied volatility in options fell even lower. The **VIX** is now below 17 and at its lowest level in a year.

**Expected Moves for the Week of April 12th:**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.3%

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here’s this week’s expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uximm5slols61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e088348a5d35c71d99bab800cd0fb56cdccc1ef

From a trader’s perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week’s 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

On Friday I compared two short premium strategies, the covered call, and and Iron Condor. [You can read that comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mnkpww/covered_calls_are_good_for_getting_called_away/) (reddit link) and see how the expected move plays a part in those types of trades.

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020, it has spent the last few months compressing from the 30’s to where it is now.

## In the News

**Alibaba (BABA)** and the Chinese government reached a settlement on anti-trust accusations, the news was released late in the day Friday. As of Friday’s close, BABA options were pricing in about a **3.5%** move for this week, and a nearly **8%** move for the next month. That 3.5% expected move for this week corresponds to about **$231** for a bullish consensus and roughly **$215** for bearish ([chart](https://14eaka193uhe3z4zmwffpyc4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-11.58.19-AM.png))

jf6zpu_BAC,BAC,BAC - Bank of America Loan Default Safety,"Hi all,

I'm new to the banking industry. On the most recent financial report, I noticed BAC's ""Commercial Reservable Criticized Utilized Exposure"" is increasing quite a bit from 4Q19  -> 1Q20 -> 2Q20 -> 3Q20.

The numbers are 11 -> 17 -> 26 -> 36 B

""Commercial Reservable Criticized Utilized Exposure Ratio"":  2.1 -> 2.8 -> 4.5 -> 6.6

New York commercial real estate seems to be tanking, and I'm wondering how this might ripple into Bank of America. Another way to think of this, is if the other banks start defaulting (WFC or JPM), how does this affect BAC? Does anyone have a good gauge on Bank of America's safety?

We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish     means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current      close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock  is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

Bullish Alerts

**$ILMN**  \- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the  tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good  setup. If it continues going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**

**$NVAX**  \- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either  get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a  pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))

**$LULU** \- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))

**$FSLY** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.

Bearish Alerts

**$BAC** \-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).

**$ZNGA** \-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).

**$GILD**  \-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down  further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.

**$WDC** \-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))

**AMD – Advanced Micro Devices**

AMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There’s been an uptick in the semi’s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.

**DKNG – DraftKings**

Draftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.

**KO – Coca Cola**

Big call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn’t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.

**INTC – Intel Corporation**

I caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It’s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.

**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**

Didn’t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven’t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We’ll find out this week.

But banks made money?

- On a few fees, sure. But let us remember:
- Banks cannot buy their stock back
- Banks will be capping their dividends more
- Banks are not issuing new credit bc nobody wants it (data shows people are cutting credit and saving)

But banks will make money?

- On defaulted mortgages and credit line starting Aug 1/aka end of unemployment, I don’t think so

But the stress test thing?

- Which they failed (lol @ JPOW pushing the narrative) and were forced to not do stock buy backs and tried to buy a ton of bonds to make JPOW happy. 
- Have you noticed how all the smart money left and XLF dropped the last 2 weeks? Whoops

- TVX (30 year yield) is shown below XLF and is a forecast of the market and XLF specifically. 
- 7/13 Fed is buying **$2.7billion** in long bonds on Monday which will crater yields. The market will follow.

h8fegx_BAC,BAC,BAC DD- 7/17 $28C,"sup guys. i work at a bank.  I want to talk about Bank of America stock, the stress tests, and PPP Loans. 

 for people who don't know how banks record loan losses i'll give a quick primer.  Banks take future predicted losses against todays earnings.  So if the bank needs 3% of their loan totals in the loan loss account, and they only have 2.5% in there, it will come out of that quarters earnings even though they didn't lose any money yet.  They just predict they will lose that amount sometime in the future. 

on Jan 1 Bank of america voluntarily adopted new basel accord requirements for loan loss reserves. They added $3.3B on January 1.  Then Covid happened and they added an additional $3.6B on March 31.  That is $7B into their reserve account that wasn't there on dec 31.  

So what? 

Between now and Jun 30th the federal reserve will announce stress test results that all banks over 100B have to go through.  BAC is on the list this year.  Passing the stress test has enormous considerations. Including the ability to increase their dividend (which they've done for 4 years).  

**PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM LOAN FEE INCOME-WHAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT**

As of 6/6/20 BAC has made 300,000+ loans totaling $24B.  Average loan size is $77,000

The government is paying these banks a fee for these loans.  

5% loan fee for loans under $350,000 

3% loan fee for loans over $350,000 and less than $2,000,00 

1% loan fee for loans over $2,000,000.  

$25B loans, at 3% fee income is $750,000,000.  Loan fees over a certain amount have to have FASB adjustments and all that means is the loan fee income is amortized over the life of the loan.  In this case, 2 years.  Doesn't matter.  They're still gonna talk about it.

These loans are essentially risk free, 100% guaranteed by the gov't.  Banks are borrowing 0% special credit facility to fund these loans.  

**BANK LOSSES DUE TO COVID** 

Banks will report close to no additional actual losses this quarter.  They offered extensions/forbearance on almost all loans. Some banks just sent a letter stating they were doing it automatically.  Those will come out of forbearance after July 1 and will not be reported past due.  They may be on a watch list, but they wont be reported past due until 30 days after the end of forbearance.

&#x200B;

> The pandemic caused sharp drops in profit at three of Bank of America’s  four main divisions. The lender’s giant consumer banking business saw  profit lower by 45% to $1.79 billion on higher loan loss reserves and  lower interest income. Wealth management profit fell 17% to $866 million  and global banking profit was nearly wiped out as the company built  larger reserves for commercial loan losses.

Revenue of $22.8 billion  essentially matched expectations, and trading results exceeded  expectations by more than $500 million.  

The bank also set aside an additional $3.6 billion for potential bad loans, a reflection of the darkening economic outlook. Its total provision for credit losses rose to $4.76 billion, from $941 million the previous quarter.

The BAC put orders are already in the money (ITM) mostly, so unsure about those. The orders that seem really aggressive is the GILD orders. I assume because of their drug for the beer virus. CCL is a no brainer but the IV is too high I think. MGM had aggressive unusual calls for the 13 calls for 05/15. Those seem to be a directional bet. So TSLA had put orders but it's hard to tell as tsla moves like a penny stock.

dmgv8q_BAC,BAC,Well-performing stocks to hold when starting portfolio? BPY-UN.TO (BPY Nasdaq)? BAC? MO? Or simply start with Dividend Aristocrats?,"   Hey all. 22 year old university student studying business in Canada, majoring in Economics and Finance. In my corporate finance course, we've recently been learning how to value stocks and bonds using different methods. Specifically, how to calculate revenue flows from the face value of bonds and their coupon rates, as well as stock prices based on the intrinsic value an investor places in a company and the dividends received. I've always know this is how the stocks are valued on the market, but haven't had the proper framework of thinking to fully understand this. My father used to tell me often about the power of compounding interest, over and over giving me the ""double a penny every day for 2 months or flat sum"" story, and it hasn't been until now that I've truly realized what that could equate to me personally. That is, if I put in the effort and show the discipline. 

   I've always been a major believer in accumulating wealth and allowing that wealth to work for you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't found the drive or necessity to make that happen for myself. After investing in my education, working hard at a serving position many days during school, and reducing my expenses as much as possible, I am fully committed to setting myself up for success. 

   I currently have about $1000 CAD to start a portfolio, and I have the intention of putting 70% of my tips accrued throughout the month into the portfolio moving forward. This will equate to about $600 CAD a month ($75x3days/week= $225 ; $225x.7 = $157.50 \~\~ $150). I've done a heavy amount of research into which investment style fits my personality and habits best, and the dividend growth method best suits my traits. Day-trading and swing trading feel more like informed (or uninformed, depending on your knowledge level) gambling. Although I do consider myself a risk-taker, I don't believe I have the experience and fortitude to tolerate the short-term, volatile goals of these strategies. I do have school to pay off, but my desire is to grow this portfolio as much as financially possible before I start accruing interest on my loans in just about 2 1/2 years. And to do this, I can't lose all of my assets invested due to my own lack of knowledge or insight.

   Now, I've done a fair amount of research into which stocks offer good yields, have good growth and have compiled a few watch-lists based on the criteria I've outlined. Thanks to a few accounting courses, I can pretty easily find my watch through reported balance sheets, income statements, etc. and have a good understanding of what to look for on these documents. BPY seems like a solid company, with international holdings, a strong investor backing and a forward yield of 6.82%. The only thing that seems to be a bit concerning to me is their assets-to-liabilities, which tells me they could face tight liquidity issues if they do not maintain their rental fees.

   Is this concerning enough to stay away, or is a this a good buy to hold for the future? Options I've looked at is Bank of America Corporation, Visa, Alteria Group, and others listed as dividend aristocrats, as well as quite a few REITS and MLP's.  Am I better of going with ONLY these guaranteed, proven winners, or should I feel confident with companies that pass my own analysis as well as diversify myself with these All-Stars?

   The platforms I've chosen are SimpleWealth Trade due to their commisionless service and IB for their history of being a cheap, trusted broker in Canada. I am using OptionsAlpha free, yahoo finance and finvis to supplement SimpleWealth's lack of analysis tools.

TL;DR: What the title says. I have $1000 CAD AKA Pond Scum, which stocks should I buy to start my dividend investing journey?

Thanks in advance for any answers, tips or wisdom!",2019-10-24,10,11

My main purpose for this is to learn about the market and experience the feelings of gaining/losing money to see if it's something I'd like to peruse more.  I would like to consider these initial investments as if they were mid to long term, say 7-20 years.

I've been eyeing the following stocks:

**T**

I like T's dividend, P/B, and current price.  However, I cannot seem to understand why their recent net cash flows are negative with the exception of 2019 Q1.  How can I research the reasons behind stats like this?

**BAC**

I like BAC's PEG ratio, and P/B, but once again am confused by negative net cash flows are negative, and why that is acceptable.  

**GM**

I like GM's ROE, PEG, and dividend but am concerned by their higher D/E.  

&#x200B;

As for ETFs, I honestly have no clue which ones to choose and why.  I understand the basics like how VYM focuses on dividends and many ETFs like VGT follow a certain sector, but how should I choose between, for example, the ETFs which follow SNP? Do I even want an ETF which follows the SNP?

Looked at iron condors that expire this week, but they just don’t seem that worth it premium wise for the risk you take on, considering that the stock has moved a few points looking at previous earnings reports. Maybe there just isn’t a good play for this symbol?

Sans a disaster of some sort, or a failure in tax reform, I see no reason it shouldn't get back to its bullish run again. Compared to most competitors in the same sector, the eps and RSI is better looking and with more Fed hikes in the future they should be making decent gainz. 



So! Will someone *please* talk me out of this? (even though I've already bought in for ~1k).

4nua65_BAC,BAC,Long $BAC - but not sure I want to be anymore...,"**TL/DR:** How would you unload BAC (long term held w/ cap gains) today in a taxable account?

Ok, here's the deal - I'm long $BAC and have been for a number of years (so I've got a very healthy profit on it).  I don't particularly love it, but I'm not paying a lot of attention to the market these days and I don't have anything more useful to do with the cash at the moment. 

So I'm debating between:

* Just continue to sit on it until I start more actively investing again
* Sell it off now (market order) and just take whatever I can get ($13.83 at the moment)
* Sell it on a limit order around $15-$16 and hope it fills sometime in the next few months
* Sell covered calls and try to make a few bucks while I'm holding on to it (I have options access in my brokerage but I haven't really done any of the research behind how to use options, other than reading about basic strategies like covered calls).

This is in a taxable account, so I'll incur long-term cap gains taxes if/when I sell.

Obviously the right answer is - ""what's in line with your financial plan?"" Of course, if I had that all figured out then I wouldn't be asking this question :)

I guess what I want to know is - if you wanted to unload BAC, how would you approach it today?",2016-06-13,1,4

However, when I add up the numbers I get the following:

Cash and cash equivalents             : 159,353 
Total debt securities                      : 407,005

Remaining assets:                        : 259,448.

2hhvol_BAC,BAC,Lets talk about Bank of America (BAC).,"I'm seeing upside to BAC even after it's recent rise.

The Bank has been chained with enormous litigation issues for the past few years, and these have finally dried up. 

The bank trades at .8x book value, many competing banks trade at a 1.2-1.4x multiple. 

Even saddled with all the litigation costs and Countrywide (Countrywide and Merrill lynch are part of the BAC umbrella), the bank still has managed to produce 64 cents a share on over 10 Billions shares. 

Now that (hopefully) the legal troubles are behind them, and forecasted EPS of 1.50-1.75 next year, I can see a rise to $20 a share quite easily from current levels in the next  6-9 months. 

Many other positive things to be said for BAC right now as well. 

Thoughts? I've invested a substantial portion of my assets in long-dated call options on the bank. ",2014-09-26,5,6

zrmw7_BAC,BAC,Analyzing JPM and BAC,"I've been in the stock market for a few years now but am pretty new to value investing and still trying to learn how to analyze companies/stocks to find the right investments.  Up until now I've mostly just speculated in tech stocks because that's what I know, but I became uncomfortable in the fact that I basically had no idea what I was doing.  With that said, I'm practicing by looking at bargain stocks and figuring out which ones are good to buy and sell, based on their financial strength and intrinsic value.

JPM: I found this from a stock screening, looking for stocks selling below book value.  At first this looked like a pretty good bet, but looking closer, they've had negative net current assets for the past few years and it isn't trending towards positive.  Yes their growth numbers look OK, but even with an optimistic 5% growth and pretty good EPS and P/E, my stock price target for them ranges from about $20-$40 per share.  And at a current price of round 39, they look like they are priced at a premium right now, even with the low price to book value ratio.

BAC: They had a pretty bad year in 2008 with their net current assets, but seem to have gotten out of that hole in recent years.  With that said, their earnings per share and PE looks pretty dismal and growth doesn't look good either.  I'm not sure what the upside for BAC is right now, but based on the fundamentals, at $9/share they seem way overpriced.  I would consider buying at about $1-2 per share.

What do you guys think about this analysis?  I'm being pretty conservative with my target prices.  Also, I don't own either of these companies, so it's purely a thought exercise.  Of the two, JPM is by far more attractive, but still there doesn't look to be a whole lot of room at the current price.  I'd be interested to see what other people have to say, and if there is something I'm not taking into account.  Thanks!

Update:  I should mention that JPM has a pretty decent and consistent dividend payout, so that could be a potential upside to buying in at the current price, but I would still feel better buying in at a lower price (<$30).",2012-09-12,10,11
