The order — the biggest in Qatar Airways’ history — includes 130 of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes, the companies said in a press release.

Qatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for more than 400 engines to power the Boeing planes, those companies said in another joint release. The purchase of widebody aircraft engines is the largest in GE Aerospace’s history, according to the release.

Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared alongside Trump at the Amiri Diwan in Doha for the signing ceremony. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “This is so we can meet the strong demand in the airline as we seamlessly connect passengers to the world better than anyone.”

Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope said the “record-breaking order” with Qatar Airways “solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center.”

1jx30s4_BA,BA,"Strategize for next week: situation speculation, gold, silver, plat, spy, BA, FXI and more","First of all, let us agree there are disagreements. Some Americans believe that China will implode in the next several months under tariff. Some Chinese believe that a U.S. civil war is imminent due to high inflation. I am not interested in debating with extremists, but you are welcome to comment below.

Let us revisit what happened this week. This is my understanding:

1. President Trump implemented global tariff, including up to 145% tariff on China. The market wasn't fully anticipating it, so the stock market crashed
2. The risk spread to the bond market, and the basis trade began to unravel. 10y and 30y treasury yield went up 75 to 100 bps in days, which means the bondholder of 30y lost 11%. Trump paused the tariff, and market went up wildly
3. Japan hedge fund exploded and saved the market on Wednesday. Nevertheless, there is still around $1T-2T basis trade to unwind. 10y is still 4.5% upon closing
4. The fickle policy led to a certain degree of de-dollarization. Over the last 24 hours, USD began to depreciate again all currencies, and drove gold and silver price up
5. Stock market bet that Fed must intervene by buying treasury bonds or cut down interest rate, so SPY went up 1.8% today
6. Trump must beat rate down to around 3% before refinancing $6-7T in late June
7. My SPY put expiring today is a 100% loss. lol

There are lot of binary events to happen, such as:

* Whether Trump will pause China tariff. This is a low possibility event, but some people suspect this may happen, because the stock market is too resilient today. If this happens, all market goes up dramatically, gold and silver will go down
* Whether Fed will cut interest rate. This is a mid-possibility event. The basis trade and carry trade are unwinding at the same time, and we may explode Sunday night. If Fed cut interest rates, all market goes up dramatically. Inflation may go out of control in the next several months, but who cares about that far out...
* Whether Trump will reach deal with any country that jointly imposes tariff on China. This is a low possibility event. Since Trump changes decisions hourly (he threatened to put more tariff on Mexico due to some water rights), I doubt whether any country will trust him that much. In addition, China may retaliate if another country, such as Japan, decides to impose tariff on China. Nevertheless, if that happens, U.S. stock goes up, China stock goes down. Not sure about gold or silver

My speculations are:

1. Nothing will happen quickly next week and we will still be living in this uncertain limbo. Therefore, keeping a position on gold and silver is necessary, if USD's global reserve status is weakened. USD will still be the primary reserve, since no other country have both the military power and can owe that much money.
2. Inspired by gold and silver, I decide to get others too. PPLT is platinum and PALL is palladium. When China keeps selling treasury, it surely won't hold USD cash and wait for it to depreciate. Maybe we have an outsized chance on plat and palladium
3. Bitcoin may have a good opportunity, but that is a separate issue. Also, I like GNS way more
4. Put BA and Call BYD. EU is negotiating with China now to remove EV barrier. I can only speculate one reason: EU wants to sell airbus aircrafts to China in exchange of opening EV barriers. This is bad for BA and good for BYD. I don't want to be suicided by BA, so I will stop here
5. Keep FXI calls. Trump will continue to find weapons to threaten China, and mentioned he may delist China Stocks. That is probably unlikely, but you don't know Trump - can you imagine a U.S. president issued a memecoin before inauguration? Nevertheless, Aug 2025 FXI calls have IV of 32% to 35%, which seems insanely low. You can also check MCHI, TCHI, KWEB, KSTR, and pick whatever flavor you like
6. Continue holding coal. In two years, China navy will outweigh U.S. navy, and U.S. navy doesn't even have repair capabilities now. Therefore Trump must rebuild steelmaking and shipbuilding, which requires coal. I also lost big on NUE calls because the market doesn't believe U.S. steelmakers have a chance - they may have a point.
7. I kept a small put position in case of a black Monday.

1jgk5r0_F,F,"Boeing wins $20B NGAD contract, beats Lockheed Martin for sixth-gen fighter jet","In a landmark decision for the United States Air Force, US President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that Boeing has been awarded a $20 billion contract to develop and produce the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter jet. This sixth-generation aircraft is set to replace Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter jet.​

The NGAD program is a cornerstone of the USAF’s strategy to maintain air superiority in the face of evolving global threats. The program is designed as a “family of systems,” with the sixth-generation fighter jet as the central element. The crewed aircraft will be designed to operate seamlessly alongside unmanned drones, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), to execute various missions.

While specific design details remain classified, the aircraft is anticipated to feature stealth capabilities, advanced sensors, and next-generation propulsion systems. The engineering and manufacturing development contract, valued at over $20 billion, positions Boeing to receive additional orders potentially worth hundreds of billions over the program’s multi-decade lifespan.

This contract award represents a pivotal victory for Boeing, particularly benefiting its fighter jet production facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The company has faced challenges in both its commercial and defense sectors in recent years. In January 2025, when presenting its fourth-quarter 2024 results, Boeing disclosed an additional $1.7 billion in defense-related charges. The NGAD contract is expected to serve as a foundational component of Boeing’s defense business moving forward, especially as its F/A-18 production line approaches closure.

The selection of Boeing over Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of both fifth-generation fighters currently operated by the USAF, namely the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, marks a significant shift in the defense contracting landscape. The move is particularly notable in light of Lockheed’s exclusion earlier in March 2025 from the US Navy’s F/A-XX program, its next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter competition, which left Boeing and Northrop Grumman as the remaining contenders

1ic29uq_BA,BA,Boeing Signals Portfolio Review After $14 Billion Cash Drain,"* Ortberg says turning around company culture will take years
* Company burned through more than $14 billion in cash 

Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said he will realign the company around key business lines and cleave off fringe assets, setting in motion a portfolio overhaul after the US planemaker emerged from a tumultuous and deeply unprofitable year.

The company has made progress in its turnaround, adjusting its factories and supplier base for higher production levels going forward, and addressing money-losing defense programs, Ortberg said in memo to employees as Boeing reported a fourth-quarter $4 billion operating loss. Fixing cultural dysfunction will be “a multi-year journey,” he said.

“We are also preparing for the path ahead by continuing to make investments in our core businesses while streamlining our portfolio in areas that are not core to our future,” said the CEO, who took over in August in the wake of a management shake-up.

The US planemaker’s dismal fourth-quarter results, parts of which it announced late last week, underscore the urgency for Ortberg to pull Boeing out of a six-year nose dive. The company burned through a total of $14.3 billion of free cash during a calamitous year marked by near-catastrophe on an airborne 737 Max, leadership turmoil, federal investigations and a lengthy worker strike.

“The big story really is about the future of this company,” said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The pre-announcement moved “the narrative of the day from what are the numbers to a very forward-looking discussion of the company.”

The operating loss per share was $5.90 for the quarter, while analysts had expected a core loss of $3.07, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the year, the company lost $20.38 per share, one of the worst showings in its history, and Boeing’s sixth straight annual deficit.

The CEO, along with Chief Financial Officer Brian West, is set to provide more detail around the defense charges and Boeing’s portfolio review during a conference call later Tuesday. Ortberg didn’t identify any assets that might be cut. The company also refrained from providing a financial outlook for the year.

The earnings put the spotlight on the troubled defense and space business, which racked up additional charges on programs including the mid-air refueling tanker and the new Air Force One presidential jet.

Among possible divestments is the Jeppesen navigation unit, which is attracting major aviation suppliers and private equity suitors and could fetch $6 billion to $8 billion for Boeing, people familiar with the talks have said.

The CEO faces a drawn-out recovery as he works to settle Boeing’s factories back into the steady operating tempo that was the norm before two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and early 2019 and the Covid pandemic hammered suppliers. But new challenges loom as Ortberg works to shore up Boeing’s quality controls and finances amid a leadership vacuum at the Federal Aviation Administration and uncertainty over global trade under the Trump Administration.

“As I’ve visited our global sites, it’s clear that we all want to help get Boeing back to the company we know it can be,” Ortberg told employees in the memo.

After raising about $34 billion in debt and equity in 2024, the US manufacturer should have a cushion as it slogs through operational difficulties that span its commercial and defense portfolios. Boeing ended the year with $26.3 billion in cash and short-term securities after pre-paying $3.5 billion of debt that is due in May.

Ortberg reiterated that Boeing is prioritizing the health of its production system and ensuring that suppliers can support any step-ups in jetliner output. The US manufacturer returned to producing five of its widebody 787 Dreamliners per month in December, Ortberg said, a target it initially set for the end of 2023.

For a second consecutive quarter, Boeing gave investors advance warning of disappointing results that were affected by a prolonged strike by 33,000 hourly workers in the final quarter of last year. The earnings included almost $3 billion in charges, including a larger-than-expected $1.7 billion accounting loss for the defense, space and security business.

Company officials have completed deep dives into five fixed-price defense and space programs, and Boeing is now “more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks,” Ortberg said.said he will realign the company around key business lines and cleave off fringe assets, setting in motion a portfolio overhaul after the US planemaker emerged from a tumultuous and deeply unprofitable year.

The company has made progress in its turnaround, adjusting its factories and supplier base for higher production levels going forward, and addressing money-losing defense programs, Ortberg said in memo to employees as Boeing reported a fourth-quarter $4 billion operating loss. Fixing cultural dysfunction will be “a multi-year journey,” he said.

Thoughts: BA posted a brutal loss for Q4 but the CEO laid out a recovery plan for the company that focuses on core businesses. This has been the SIXTH consecutive annual loss they've posted. (They've also been delayed by the machinist strike). Still don't think it's investible.

1ic29uq_PATH,PATH,Boeing Signals Portfolio Review After $14 Billion Cash Drain,"* Ortberg says turning around company culture will take years
* Company burned through more than $14 billion in cash 

Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said he will realign the company around key business lines and cleave off fringe assets, setting in motion a portfolio overhaul after the US planemaker emerged from a tumultuous and deeply unprofitable year.

The company has made progress in its turnaround, adjusting its factories and supplier base for higher production levels going forward, and addressing money-losing defense programs, Ortberg said in memo to employees as Boeing reported a fourth-quarter $4 billion operating loss. Fixing cultural dysfunction will be “a multi-year journey,” he said.

“We are also preparing for the path ahead by continuing to make investments in our core businesses while streamlining our portfolio in areas that are not core to our future,” said the CEO, who took over in August in the wake of a management shake-up.

The US planemaker’s dismal fourth-quarter results, parts of which it announced late last week, underscore the urgency for Ortberg to pull Boeing out of a six-year nose dive. The company burned through a total of $14.3 billion of free cash during a calamitous year marked by near-catastrophe on an airborne 737 Max, leadership turmoil, federal investigations and a lengthy worker strike.

“The big story really is about the future of this company,” said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The pre-announcement moved “the narrative of the day from what are the numbers to a very forward-looking discussion of the company.”

The operating loss per share was $5.90 for the quarter, while analysts had expected a core loss of $3.07, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the year, the company lost $20.38 per share, one of the worst showings in its history, and Boeing’s sixth straight annual deficit.

The CEO, along with Chief Financial Officer Brian West, is set to provide more detail around the defense charges and Boeing’s portfolio review during a conference call later Tuesday. Ortberg didn’t identify any assets that might be cut. The company also refrained from providing a financial outlook for the year.

1i1vfev_BA,BA,Boeing (BA) elevator pitch,"Hello r/ValueInvesting

Today I am sharing a very short elevator pitch idea on Boeing (BA) and why it is a sensible turn-around. Any constructive feedback is welcome. I would like to note that this is not a company analysis, just a very short summary of my thesis.

Boeing and Airbus form a legal duopoly, accounting for 99% of commercial aircraft deliveries. BA has a 10-year order backlog worth $500 billion, while Airbus has a 20-year backlog. So airlines have only two options, they can either opt to stick with BA and endure the recent difficulties while remaining in the lineup for aircraft orders, or to choose Airbus and be placed at the rear of the 20-year backlog. Neither BA nor AIR has the capacity to fullfill the demand in a short-term time horizont.

In short, BA possesses a duopoly-enabled pricing power and a long-term sustainable moat of secured revenue stream in an industry with extremely high barriers of entry.

Unlike the previous CEO, BA have recently selected a new one with an engineering AND financial background. The company's defense business has a long history with the U.S. government. BA is a huge employer and a major piece of the U.S. economy, both as a military contractor and in commercial aviation, which support a too big to fail narrative. 

BA has raised $20 billion in cash, which has put the solvency issues off the table.  It is worth noting that the recent BO crashes and difficulties have primarily affected older-spec aircraft.  

All of these factors constitute a great turnaround situation in my eyes. You can get business with downward protection from the U.S. government, a moat, and pricing power at depressed prices. As the fundamentals improve, the market will eventually re-rate the stock. Patience is the key with a play like this, and I think a double is possible in the next 2 to 3 years.",2025-01-15,17,25

1hf1foj_BA,BA,2024 Dec Boeing Stock Analysis,"# 1)    Boeing Business Background

Boeing's revenue is divided among three main segments: 

* Commercial Airplanes                     
* Defense, Space & Security (BDS)    
* Global Services                                  

Between 2023 and 2024, 

**a. Commercial Airplanes**

2023 Revenue: $77.8 billion

2024 Revenue: $82.0 billion

Change: +5.4%

This growth can be attributed to higher aircraft deliveries.

**b. Defense, Space & Security (BDS)**

2023 Revenue: $55.8 billion

2024 Revenue: $51.3 billion

Change: - 8%

This decline cause includes supply chain issues.

 **c. Global Services**  

2023 Revenue: $19.98 billion

2024 Revenue: $22.0 billion

Change: +10%

The growth can be attributed to increased demand for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services.

# 2) New Leader Kelly Ortberg and New Plan

New CEO Kelly Ortberg, an engineer, joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager and rose through the ranks to become president and CEO since 2013.

He said he’ll walk the main factory floor near Seattle on his first day and relocate to Seattle.

**New Plan:**

1.  Fundamentally transform the company's culture

§  Dismantle global DEI department.

§  Sara Liang Bowen, who led the DEI department since 2019, announced her resignation.

2. Optimize Supply Chain

3. Focus on Core Products 737 Max and 777

4. Reduce Boeing's workforce by about 10% to improve finance.

# 3) Air industry Market Demand

The air industry is expected to see significant growth over the next five years, driven by several key factors:

**1. Recovery from the Pandemic**

In 2024, global air travel passenger traffic is expected to reach 9.4 billion passengers, surpassing the pre-pandemic level of 9.2 billion passengers in 2019.

**2. Economic Growth**

Global economic growth, particularly in regions like Asia, is expected to boost air travel demand. Asia Pacific is anticipated to lead the growth, contributing to more than half of the global net gain in passenger numbers by 2030.

**3. E-commerce and Cargo**

The growth of e-commerce is driving demand for air cargo services. Cargo operations are expected to continue growing, with air cargo revenue projected to increase by 5.4% in 2025.

**4. Geopolitical Factors**

Geopolitical tensions and trade policies can impact air travel demand and cargo volumes. Companies are increasingly multi-sourcing and diversifying their supply chains, which can affect air cargo routes and volumes.

# 4) Boeing Aircraft Backlog Order

As of October 2024, Boeing's backlog of aircraft orders stands at 6,246 aircraft worth $475 billion.

737 MAX           4,741 orders. Estimated $300 billion.

787 Dreamliner   785 orders. Estimated $130 billion.

777 aircraft          60 orders.   Estimated   $20 billion.

# 5) Impact of Trump Tariff Policy

**Pros:** Trump's administration’s focus on promoting American manufacturing and exports might support Boeing's efforts to sell more aircraft internationally.

**Cons:** His proposed tariffs and trade wars could create significant challenges for Boeing by increasing costs and potentially leading to retaliatory measures from other countries. In addition, stronger US dollar will cause aircraft client financial cost.

# 6) FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Restrictions

The FAA has imposed several restrictions and increased oversight on Boeing:

·        FAA grounded 171 Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft in January 2024.

·        FAA halted any production expansion of the Boeing 737 MAX.

·        FAA has increased its oversight of Boeing's production lines.

FAA chief Michael Whitaker will step down on Jan 2025. The 2025 policy change is unknown.

1gk0wsl_BA,BA,""" Boeing workers vote to accept deal, end strike ""","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/business/boeing-strike-vote-hnk-intl/index.html


New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.

View Comments

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

# Election Day Showdown: Trump vs. Harris And Your Portfolio

It’s finally Election Day, and after a campaign season that brought us viral squirrels, bear sightings, and unexpected pet memes, we’re getting back to the real talk: What does this mean for the economy? 

Trump and Harris are pitching policies that could shake up your portfolio—here’s a breakdown of their promises, from taxes to trade and everything in between.

**Big Tax Moves**

Both candidates are waving different tax flags. Harris wants to roll the corporate tax rate up to 28%, targeting high earners with a minimum 25% tax on mega-wealth (those with over $100 million) and boosting capital gains for millionaires to 28%. 

Trump, on the other hand, aims to lower the corporate rate to 15% for U.S.-based manufacturing and continue the individual and estate tax cuts he pushed in 2017. For big companies, these tax changes could directly affect their bottom lines, impacting market values and shareholder earnings.

**Tariffs & Trade**

Trump's plans are bolder when it comes to tariffs, proposing a 10% across-the-board levy on imports and up to a 200% tariff on Mexican-made cars. The goal? A “Made in America” resurgence, though economists warn this could send prices up across consumer goods. 

Harris hasn’t proposed anything quite as drastic but has hinted she’d maintain Biden-era tariffs. While Trump’s approach is all about pushing U.S. manufacturing, Harris’s steadier stance may appeal to those wary of increased inflation risks.

**What’s Next for Your Portfolio?**

Analysts suggest a Harris administration could benefit clean energy, healthcare, and homebuilding sectors, while Trump could mean gains for oil, financials, and crypto. 

But here’s the kicker: No matter who wins, staying diversified is key. Historically, the market has weathered administrations of all stripes and come out on top, and experts say focusing on long-term investments over election reactions is a winning strategy.

**The Bottom Line:** Campaign rhetoric is one thing; actual policy is another. Congress has a knack for turning grand ideas into smaller compromises, so while the headlines might sound big, the reality might be more tempered. As we head into a period of potential market jitters, a steady hand and a diversified portfolio might be the most presidential decision you can make.

# Boeing Ends Crippling Strike as Workers Accept Latest Offer

After a 53-day standoff, Boeing’s machinists are ready to trade picket signs for power tools again. In a nail-biter of a vote, 59% of union members gave the thumbs-up to a new contract that includes a hefty 38% pay bump over four years. '

Boeing’s production lines can finally get back in gear, which means more jets—and less red ink.

**A Deal That Soars Higher Than a 737**

This new contract is a big win for Boeing’s workforce. We’re talking a 13% instant pay boost, with average salaries climbing to around $119,000 by the end of the deal. Plus, there’s a $12,000 signing bonus to sweeten the pot. 

After years of less-than-stellar raises, machinists have muscled in some major gains—though it did take seven weeks of picketing and freezing fingers to make it happen.

**New CEO, New Strategy, and a Costly Pause**

For Boeing’s new CEO Kelly Ortberg, it’s been a turbulent start. Since August, he’s been cutting costs, raising cash, and trying to stay aloft amid production halts and stock hits. The strike alone was draining Boeing of $100 million a day—something the jet giant could hardly afford as shares plummeted over 40% this year. 

The settlement is welcome news, but getting production back up to speed won’t be instant, especially with 737 MAX orders still lagging.

**What’s Next: Planes, Patience, and Recovery**

Machinists will be back on the factory floor this week, but don’t expect planes to roll out overnight. Boeing’s whole supply chain, from fuselage makers to flight-schedule-hungry airlines, took a hit during the strike.

Ramping up production will take time, and Boeing’s finances are far from stable, with the company still predicting a cash flow drought through 2025.

The bottom line? Boeing may have scored a truce with its workers, but it’s still got plenty of turbulence to ride out on its journey back to cruising altitude.

1gjd018_PATH,PATH,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.

**Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**

Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.

Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position. 

**Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**

Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth. 

The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.

**Valuation and Investment Prospects**

Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.

**Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**

Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.

Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.

**Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.

1g9j5ab_BA,BA,Boeing Earnings Pre-Market Tomorrow – Call Spread Setups and Net GEX,"

With Boeing (BA) set to release earnings tomorrow before the market opens, I've taken a look at some interesting setups ahead of the event.

In the attached chart, you can see the current price action of Boeing on the daily chart, along with the Net Gamma Exposure (GEX) by strike prices for this week. GEX can help gauge where market makers might have a significant hedging activity, giving us a clue about potential support/resistance levels. The bars indicate how much hedging could occur around key strikes like 160, 165, and 170, which might act as pivotal zones depending on the reaction to the earnings release.

Alongside this, I’ve highlighted a range of Call Calendar and Call Butterfly spread combinations that expire this week. These options strategies offer an efficient way to play a potential volatility spike while managing risk. The table breaks down:

Strike Prices: Each strike combination shows where the strategies are centered.
Price and Profit Potential: A quick glance at the potential returns based on current market conditions.
Risk-to-Reward Ratios (R/R): Some spreads have incredible R/R ratios but beware of calendars where the front leg will have a IV crash, so the R/R is pretty theoretical.
These spread strategies allow for flexibility going into the earnings event, especially if Boeing shows significant movement, which is common after earnings. Watch for how IV changes and consider adjusting positions as needed.

If you are interested, I can run my scan for put spreads as well, or iron condors.

# Boeing Raises $25B Amid Strikes, Layoffs, and Cash Crunch

Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is facing a pretty turbulent start. 

With 33,000 striking workers grinding the production of its 737 jets to a halt, it’s been a tough month for the company. And the price tag for this gridlock? A staggering $5 billion in collective losses for Boeing, its suppliers, and Seattle-area businesses. The labor dispute is about better pay, but with both sides standing their ground, there’s no sign of a resolution anytime soon.

**The Costly Domino Effect**  
The strike is only one part of Boeing’s problem cocktail. The company is staring down $5 billion in extra costs this quarter thanks to delays in its defense and commercial units. The long-awaited 777X? Yeah, it’s pushed back another year to 2026, and that didn’t sit well with Emirates, one of its biggest customers. 

Oh, and let’s not forget the looming layoffs—Boeing is planning to cut 17,000 jobs as it tries to stop the financial bleeding. Boeing’s stock is already down 40% this year, so it’s safe to say investors aren’t thrilled.

**Cash Crunch Mode:** Boeing is desperately looking to shore up its finances. To plug its cash drain, it’s planning to raise at least $10 billion by selling shares and recently secured a new $10 billion credit line. 

That’s a good move to keep the lights on, but analysts warn that Boeing’s debt could get downgraded to junk status if it doesn’t get its act together. With $45 billion in net debt, Boeing is walking a tightrope—and the union strike isn’t helping.

**Can They Pull Up?**  
Despite all the turbulence, Boeing isn’t out of the game just yet. The company has a backlog of 5,500 aircraft orders, worth about half a trillion dollars, so there’s still a light at the end of the runway. But CEO Ortberg’s first earnings call on October 23 will be make-or-break as he tries to convince investors that Boeing can weather the storm.

Investors will be watching closely—because Boeing is in desperate need of a smooth landing.

# Boeing Raises $25B Amid Strikes, Layoffs, and Cash Crunch

Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is facing a pretty turbulent start. 

With 33,000 striking workers grinding the production of its 737 jets to a halt, it’s been a tough month for the company. And the price tag for this gridlock? A staggering $5 billion in collective losses for Boeing, its suppliers, and Seattle-area businesses. The labor dispute is about better pay, but with both sides standing their ground, there’s no sign of a resolution anytime soon.

**The Costly Domino Effect**  
The strike is only one part of Boeing’s problem cocktail. The company is staring down $5 billion in extra costs this quarter thanks to delays in its defense and commercial units. The long-awaited 777X? Yeah, it’s pushed back another year to 2026, and that didn’t sit well with Emirates, one of its biggest customers. 

Oh, and let’s not forget the looming layoffs—Boeing is planning to cut 17,000 jobs as it tries to stop the financial bleeding. Boeing’s stock is already down 40% this year, so it’s safe to say investors aren’t thrilled.

**Cash Crunch Mode:** Boeing is desperately looking to shore up its finances. To plug its cash drain, it’s planning to raise at least $10 billion by selling shares and recently secured a new $10 billion credit line. 

That’s a good move to keep the lights on, but analysts warn that Boeing’s debt could get downgraded to junk status if it doesn’t get its act together. With $45 billion in net debt, Boeing is walking a tightrope—and the union strike isn’t helping.

**Can They Pull Up?**  
Despite all the turbulence, Boeing isn’t out of the game just yet. The company has a backlog of 5,500 aircraft orders, worth about half a trillion dollars, so there’s still a light at the end of the runway. But CEO Ortberg’s first earnings call on October 23 will be make-or-break as he tries to convince investors that Boeing can weather the storm.

Investors will be watching closely—because Boeing is in desperate need of a smooth landing.

# The Earnings Roundtable 

* 💰 **Goldman Sachs Profits Jump 45% on Trading Surge:** Goldman Sachs crushed it in Q3, with profits up 45% to $2.99 billion, driven by a banner quarter in its stock-trading division—its best in over three years. Investment banking also beat expectations, helping overall revenue rise 7% to $12.7 billion. Not everything is gold, though: fixed-income trading dipped 12%, and the firm took a $415 million hit from its exit of a credit card partnership with GM. Investors still seem bullish—Goldman’s stock is up 34% this year. ($GS)

* 🧨 **ASML Takes a Hit on Weak Chip Demand:** ASML got walloped in Q3, with shares plunging 16%, the worst drop in 26 years. The semiconductor giant reported just €2.6 billion in bookings, missing analyst expectations by nearly half. ASML blamed the weak demand on a slower-than-expected recovery in the chip sector and slashed its 2025 sales forecast, sending ripple effects through chip stocks like Nvidia. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged that customer caution is weighing down growth. ($ASML) 
* 🏥 **UnitedHealth Drops on 2025 Profit Warning:** UnitedHealth Group stumbled big time, with shares falling over 8% after the company issued a 2025 profit outlook below Wall Street’s expectations. Rising medical expenses and tighter government reimbursement rules are squeezing the healthcare titan. Its medical-loss ratio, a key cost measure, hit 85.2%, higher than the forecasted 84.4%. Despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, the future looks a bit cloudy for UnitedHealth. ($UNH) 
* 📊 **Bank of America Beats on Trading and Banking:** Bank of America rode a trading and investment banking surge in Q3, with revenue from its trading desk jumping 12% to $4.93 billion. Investment banking revenue was up 15%, driven by stronger-than-expected dealmaking. Net interest income, while down, dropped less than analysts feared, giving the bank a solid footing as interest rates begin to stabilize. Shares rose .55% today, bringing BofA’s 2024 gain to 26%. ($BAC) 
* 💸 **Schwab Soars After Beating Expectations:** Charles Schwab shares shot up 6.10% today after reporting a Q3 earnings beat, with adjusted EPS of 77 cents, topping estimates. The brokerage firm also slashed $8.9 billion in debt, a sign that it's recovering from last year’s customer exodus in search of higher yields. With cash flow improving and costs under control, Schwab’s rebound from its rocky 2023 seems to be picking up speed. ($SCHW) 
* 🏬 **Walgreens to Close 14% of US Stores:** Walgreens is taking drastic measures to trim costs, announcing it’ll close 14% of its US stores over the next three years. The drugstore chain plans to shutter 500 stores in 2025 alone. Investors liked the move—shares jumped nearly 16% after Walgreens also topped Q4 earnings estimates with $0.39 per share, just above the predicted $0.36. But the drugstore chain isn’t out of the woods yet, facing stiff competition from online retailers and low-budget giants like Dollar General. ($WBA) 
* 💼 **United Airlines Beats Expectations, Announces Buyback:** United Airlines shrugged off the summer’s fare wars to report a Q3 profit that left Wall Street pleasantly surprised. Adjusted earnings hit $3.33 per share, beating the $3.07 forecast, and revenue totaled $14.8 billion, thanks to a rebound in corporate travel and premium tickets. As a cherry on top, United authorized a $1.5 billion share buyback plan—$500 million of which will be repurchased this year. The stock’s up over 50% year-to-date, outpacing its rivals. ($UAL)

# Boeing Raises $25B Amid Strikes, Layoffs, and Cash Crunch

Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is facing a pretty turbulent start. 

With 33,000 striking workers grinding the production of its 737 jets to a halt, it’s been a tough month for the company. And the price tag for this gridlock? A staggering $5 billion in collective losses for Boeing, its suppliers, and Seattle-area businesses. The labor dispute is about better pay, but with both sides standing their ground, there’s no sign of a resolution anytime soon.

**The Costly Domino Effect**  
The strike is only one part of Boeing’s problem cocktail. The company is staring down $5 billion in extra costs this quarter thanks to delays in its defense and commercial units. The long-awaited 777X? Yeah, it’s pushed back another year to 2026, and that didn’t sit well with Emirates, one of its biggest customers. 

Oh, and let’s not forget the looming layoffs—Boeing is planning to cut 17,000 jobs as it tries to stop the financial bleeding. Boeing’s stock is already down 40% this year, so it’s safe to say investors aren’t thrilled.

**Cash Crunch Mode:** Boeing is desperately looking to shore up its finances. To plug its cash drain, it’s planning to raise at least $10 billion by selling shares and recently secured a new $10 billion credit line. 

That’s a good move to keep the lights on, but analysts warn that Boeing’s debt could get downgraded to junk status if it doesn’t get its act together. With $45 billion in net debt, Boeing is walking a tightrope—and the union strike isn’t helping.

**Can They Pull Up?**  
Despite all the turbulence, Boeing isn’t out of the game just yet. The company has a backlog of 5,500 aircraft orders, worth about half a trillion dollars, so there’s still a light at the end of the runway. But CEO Ortberg’s first earnings call on October 23 will be make-or-break as he tries to convince investors that Boeing can weather the storm.

Investors will be watching closely—because Boeing is in desperate need of a smooth landing.

# The Earnings Roundtable 

* 💰 **Goldman Sachs Profits Jump 45% on Trading Surge:** Goldman Sachs crushed it in Q3, with profits up 45% to $2.99 billion, driven by a banner quarter in its stock-trading division—its best in over three years. Investment banking also beat expectations, helping overall revenue rise 7% to $12.7 billion. Not everything is gold, though: fixed-income trading dipped 12%, and the firm took a $415 million hit from its exit of a credit card partnership with GM. Investors still seem bullish—Goldman’s stock is up 34% this year. ($GS)

* 🧨 **ASML Takes a Hit on Weak Chip Demand:** ASML got walloped in Q3, with shares plunging 16%, the worst drop in 26 years. The semiconductor giant reported just €2.6 billion in bookings, missing analyst expectations by nearly half. ASML blamed the weak demand on a slower-than-expected recovery in the chip sector and slashed its 2025 sales forecast, sending ripple effects through chip stocks like Nvidia. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged that customer caution is weighing down growth. ($ASML) 
* 🏥 **UnitedHealth Drops on 2025 Profit Warning:** UnitedHealth Group stumbled big time, with shares falling over 8% after the company issued a 2025 profit outlook below Wall Street’s expectations. Rising medical expenses and tighter government reimbursement rules are squeezing the healthcare titan. Its medical-loss ratio, a key cost measure, hit 85.2%, higher than the forecasted 84.4%. Despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, the future looks a bit cloudy for UnitedHealth. ($UNH) 
* 📊 **Bank of America Beats on Trading and Banking:** Bank of America rode a trading and investment banking surge in Q3, with revenue from its trading desk jumping 12% to $4.93 billion. Investment banking revenue was up 15%, driven by stronger-than-expected dealmaking. Net interest income, while down, dropped less than analysts feared, giving the bank a solid footing as interest rates begin to stabilize. Shares rose .55% today, bringing BofA’s 2024 gain to 26%.

Not everything is gold, though: fixed-income trading dipped 12%, and the firm took a $415 million hit from its exit of a credit card partnership with GM.

# Boeing Raises $25B Amid Strikes, Layoffs, and Cash Crunch

Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is facing a pretty turbulent start. 

With 33,000 striking workers grinding the production of its 737 jets to a halt, it’s been a tough month for the company. And the price tag for this gridlock? A staggering $5 billion in collective losses for Boeing, its suppliers, and Seattle-area businesses. The labor dispute is about better pay, but with both sides standing their ground, there’s no sign of a resolution anytime soon.

**The Costly Domino Effect**  
The strike is only one part of Boeing’s problem cocktail. The company is staring down $5 billion in extra costs this quarter thanks to delays in its defense and commercial units. The long-awaited 777X? Yeah, it’s pushed back another year to 2026, and that didn’t sit well with Emirates, one of its biggest customers. 

Oh, and let’s not forget the looming layoffs—Boeing is planning to cut 17,000 jobs as it tries to stop the financial bleeding. Boeing’s stock is already down 40% this year, so it’s safe to say investors aren’t thrilled.

**Cash Crunch Mode:** Boeing is desperately looking to shore up its finances. To plug its cash drain, it’s planning to raise at least $10 billion by selling shares and recently secured a new $10 billion credit line. 

That’s a good move to keep the lights on, but analysts warn that Boeing’s debt could get downgraded to junk status if it doesn’t get its act together. With $45 billion in net debt, Boeing is walking a tightrope—and the union strike isn’t helping.

**Can They Pull Up?**  
Despite all the turbulence, Boeing isn’t out of the game just yet. The company has a backlog of 5,500 aircraft orders, worth about half a trillion dollars, so there’s still a light at the end of the runway. But CEO Ortberg’s first earnings call on October 23 will be make-or-break as he tries to convince investors that Boeing can weather the storm.

Investors will be watching closely—because Boeing is in desperate need of a smooth landing.

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

 Because it is either BA dilutes stock to raise equity or take on more debt and become junk status. Both are bad for investors but the latter is much worse.

1fpb7uf_BA,BA,Boeing losing '$100 million to $150 million a day' as union strike rolls on,"
Boeing (BA) is facing massive financial pressure as its labor strike with the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union stretches into its second week. The strike is costing the company between $100 million and $150 million every single day, amounting to a potential $1.8 billion loss so far. This staggering financial hit comes at a time when Boeing is already grappling with other challenges, compounding its need for a quick resolution.

Earlier this week, Boeing made a bold move by bypassing union leadership and presenting a ""best and final"" offer directly to its 33,000 workers. The new proposal increased wage hikes to 30% (up from 25%), doubled the signing bonus to $6,000, and enhanced 401(k) contributions. However, this approach backfired as it angered the IAM, which saw the direct communication as disrespectful. ""Members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,"" the union said in a statement, emphasizing that workers felt the proposal was still inadequate.

Despite the company's financial losses, Boeing rejected the union’s invitation for direct talks. This refusal highlights the difficult position Boeing is in, according to aviation expert Anita Mendiratta. She explained that Boeing is losing significant revenue due to its inability to deliver 737 Max jets from its Renton, Wash., facility, which is its primary cash cow. While the company can still deliver some 787 Dreamliners from its non-union facility in South Carolina, production numbers are much smaller, amplifying the financial strain.

The strike is not only a financial blow but also a reputational hit for Boeing. Public support for labor unions is growing, and the IAM is leveraging this momentum. ""The union is in a very strong position,"" said Mendiratta, noting that Boeing’s attempts to bypass union leadership have only deepened the divide. As the company’s losses mount and its stock is down 40% year-to-date, pressure is building on Boeing and its CEO, Kelly Ortberg, to find a resolution before third-quarter earnings are reported in late October.

For Boeing, the clock is ticking. Each day of the strike further drains its cash reserves and complicates its already fragile financial standing. With so much at stake, a deal needs to be reached soon—both to stop the financial bleeding and to repair the company’s standing in the eyes of both its workers and the public.

On Monday, Boeing upped its offer to the union, which represents 33,000 workers, but did not proceed through union leadership and instead sent a ""best and final"" offer directly to workers, which didn’t sit well with the IAM. Boeing’s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.

""The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,"" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.""

Earlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in “direct talks” after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.

Nevertheless, Boeing’s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.

“Boeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they’re losing between $100 million and $150 million,” Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.

Without union workers based in Boeing’s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company’s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.

Mendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.

“It’s not just Boeing that’s in trouble — the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,” Mendiratta said. “When there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.”

Mendiratta doesn’t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing’s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

Making a small bet in the $120 strike put option,"As you know, Boeing has messed up again, and the ongoing work strike could last another 1-2 months, similar to the automotive strikes. This will likely drain Boeing’s cash flow by at least another $3 billion. Given they’re already operating with negative cash flow, any further bleed will push back their timeline to achieve positive cash flow.

Keep in mind that the upcoming quarterly report is shaping up to be another nightmare for shareholders. The additional red tape in their production process, aimed at improving quality, is only going to slow things down further, leading to more delivery delays and cost increases.

We can expect their losses to widen, cash flow to worsen, and it’s very likely the stock price will drop below $100 after the next quarterly results. So, put it is.

1fdksv5_BA,BA,"Boeing delivers 40 jets in August, up 5 from a year ago","Sept 10 (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab said on Tuesday it delivered 40 commercial jets in August, up five from the same month in 2023 when it struggled with a manufacturing defect on its 737 MAX, as the U.S. planemaker eyes higher output under new CEO Kelly Ortberg.

Boeing has pledged to boost production of its strongest selling jet, the MAX, to 38 per month by year's end.

But the planemaker faces obstacles such as a possible strike as early as Friday by more than 32,000 Seattle-area and Portland factory workers who vote on a new deal Sept. 12.

The U.S. planemaker is operating a slower assembly line since a Jan. 5 in-flight blowout, opens new tab of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9 jet that heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Boeing handed over 32 MAX jets to customers last month, including nine deliveries to customers in China, the most since December 2019.

Boeing delivered 43 commercial jets in July, including 31 MAX jets.

Investors closely watch delivery numbers, as airplane makers receive the majority of payment for an aircraft when it is transferred to a customer.

After adjustments to reflect the backlog, Boeing reported adjusted net orders for the month of 24.

That brought Boeing's gross order total so far this year through August 31 to 250. After removing cancellations and conversions, Boeing posted a net total of 207 orders since the start of 2024.

Following further accounting adjustments, Boeing reported adjusted net orders of 122 airplanes so far this year.

Year to date through August 31, Boeing delivered 258 airplanes, including 198 MAX jets.

European rival Airbus (AIR.PA), opens new tab said last week it had delivered 47 aircraft in August, down from 77 in July, to reach 447 so far this year.

1fbafk1_BA,BA,A Definitive and Certain Look at the Future of Boeing,"Shut your pie holes and crack open your earholes, degens, weed lovers, and occupants of the famed dumpster out back, because I’ve been staring at charts as wide as your mother and I’ve figured out exactly where Boeing goes from here.

It required a diligent search, but after weeks of mind-numbing, soul-crushing toil, it finally clicked with me. We already know where Boeing is going. Why?

Because we’ve seen it before.

Here, with an adjusted accuracy rating of a billion four, IV of 420%, bid of 0.28 and ask of 84.53, is what will happen to Boeing in the next five years:


• BA representatives will be kicked out of a meeting with representatives of the Federal Reserve after fighting a security guard

•⁠ CEO will declare ""Don't touch me. I'm the stock exchange""

• CFO will take a personal stretch limo to a charity event, have them open every single expensive bottle of wine, and reject it. Will refuse to pay for it (charity, remember), then leave

• ⁠The engineering department will throw fits over not getting enough equity

• ⁠Members of the R&D Department will drive 100 down McKnight Road in Pittsburgh, which has a 45 MPH speed limit

• ⁠A safety engineering division will trash a condo and throw furniture out a 14th floor window, which will almost hit some people, notably a child

• ⁠Janitor will kill a home aquarium full of piranhas and accounting will refuse to pay the man who installed the tank

• ⁠Will refuse to submit earnings report each quarter for the next three years

• ⁠CEO will demand a trade from the NYSE

• ⁠CFO will start calling themselves ""Mr. Big Chest""

• ⁠A mid-level procurement analyst will throw a fit over Intel winning Nasdaq MVP and will trash them on social media

• ⁠(Allegedly) nix a trade that would've sent Boeing to TSX

• ⁠Random engineering department will show up to NYSE training camp in a hot air balloon

• ⁠Same engineering department will hold out and refuse to show up to NYSE training camp because the NYSE would not approve their blueprints because the dirigibles relied on 1800’s technology

• ⁠COO will freeze his feet

• Same engineering department will try to paint over their old designs and pass them off as new ones, hoping no one would notice I guess

• ⁠Same engineering department will acquire a newer version of the same model of blueprint, which the NYSE refused to let them use before

• Same engineering department will finally pick a new project and show up to NYSE training camp

• Same engineering department will get fined by NYSE for not attending camp

• ⁠Same engineering department will tweet the fines

• ⁠Head of accounting will try to fight JPow and call him a cracker. He will have to be held back by the CEO, and then will punt a dirigible down the conference room and shout ""fine me for that""

• ⁠Will get fined for that

• CFO will release a video where he used audio of Patrick Gelsinger, who didn't know he was being recorded, which is illegal in California (full disclosure, Gelsinger has said he gave permission, but the generally accepted theory is that he said that in the hope that it would help get him to show up to the facility and not alienate him)

• ⁠CEO will demand a release from the NYSE

• ⁠Will get released

• ⁠""GRANDMA I’M FREEEEEE! FLY LIKE A FREEEEE!""

• ⁠Other sexual harassment allegations come out (the ones where they don’t get sued)

• ⁠The board will threaten a woman not suing the company in a group text that included their lawyer and had a picture of her kids in the text

• Will be released by the LSE after one week

• Various departments will go off on a tweet storm and say a lot of crazy shit about a lot of people, and will be supportive of people sending threats to the writer of an article detailing the sexual harassment allegations

• CEO will announce Boeing is “done” with the LSE

• Entire engineering department will go back to college via online classes

1f15o62_BA,BA,"You, too, can easily predict Boeing crashes! (A serious and in depth discussion on Boeing, ULA, NASA, and the future of spaceflight)","Good day fellow regards,

First of all, y'all are wild! A lazy Saturday morning tongue-in-cheek shitpost about Boeing and the NASA press conference has a lot of you wearing tin foil hats, but man Stevie Wonder saw this coming on Thursday. No, there’s no “insider trading” or outing my dad, or any other wacky ideas you have. Here, I'll walk you through it:

2014 - NASA announces the  
ISS CCP contract, awarding both Boeing ($4.2 bil) and SpaceX ($2.6 bil) getting  
the actual final contracts, with first flights targeted for 2017. Space-X  
develops the Dragon, launches on the Falcon 9, massive success, yada yada, you  
know the story. Boeing meanwhile buys Atlas V rockets (from itself at ULA) to  
fly their Starliner, which we'll get back to in a bit.

Starliner's unmanned OFT1 test flight came 2 years late in 2019 and was an absolute shitshow start to finish. So bad, in fact, that NASA required a second unmanned OFT2 test flight, which Boeing didn't complete until 2022, and was also a total failure (remember that it tried launching in 2021 and couldn’t, and a crew abort system test was required afterwards). There was a lot of speculation that an OFT3 was needed,  
but NASA kind of surprised everyone by letting the Astronauts go up on the  
current CFT1 mission this summer, albeit with highly experienced NASA  
astronauts on board, and not Boeing’s crew (for reasons that are highly  
apparent now). 

The ISS is a menagerie of disparate modules strapped together with next to no standardization. There’s an excellent USA Today article that came out a couple of weeks ago: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/nasa-starliner-astronauts-iss/74590421007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/nasa-starliner-astronauts-iss/74590421007/) That means that until the Starliner is jettisoned, nobody else was coming up. The writing was on the wall on 8/16 when Boeing quietly announced that it was in talks to sell ULA to Sierra [https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/)

Thursday NASA announced it was holding the final decision press conference on Saturday at 1 PM ET - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/leadership-to-discuss-nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/leadership-to-discuss-nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test/) This is where even Stevie Wonder saw the final decision. Ask yourself if you’ve ever known a government worker to come in on a Saturday? And why would NASA hold that conference at that date and time unless it was bad news for their publicly-traded contractor? You should have all been calling your nana’s puts or whatever the heck it is you do (I’m only here for the memes and spaceflight chatter, I dunno why you like space company stocks, but that’s how I got here)

And seriously, this decision has been predicted for weeks by the likes of NASASpaceflightNow and Ars Technica (who have amazing Rocket Reports, highly recommended - [https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/rocket-report-a-ula-sale-tidbit-polaris-dawn-mission-is-on-deck/](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/rocket-report-a-ula-sale-tidbit-polaris-dawn-mission-is-on-deck/) )

That brings us to the actual announcement of SpaceX to the rescue (in the words of Billie Eilish, duh) - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/) The more telling piece in this announcement, is that there will be a 3-week lag time between Starliner undocking and the SpaceX Crew 9 launch. History students of NASA will recognize that as an abnormally large amount of time to leave the ISS manned with a single lifeboat (Crew 8), especially one that does not exactly have the space (or space suits) for all the astronauts onboard. The fact that NASA thinks it’s less risky to keep so many people on the ISS without adequate lifeboat coverage for such duration is frankly pretty huge. Let’s talk about what that means.

First, why did NASA not require the 3^(rd) unmanned test with so many issues on the 2 OFT’s? Well, remember the Atlas V thing? ULA builds the Atlas V and announced in 2021 that it was getting retired, and finished the last production rockets earlier this year. All 15 Atlas V’s left have been spoken for, and that includes all of Boeing’s ISS CCP missions (only 6).

Well, NASA also announced that the ISS is being shut down and de-orbited in 2030 - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/) which isn’t that far away. NASA has more or less 6 years of needs to service the ISS at this point, and it will absolutely take Boeing at least 2 years to get the next mission ready, which let’s face it, will be a test again. (Two of the board members on the safety panel for this mission were on the Columbia panel and were overruled, they are damn well not going to let that happen again).

Well ULA is already contracted with Amazon for some of it’s Kuiper constellation of satellites, on those aforementioned Atlas V’s. It makes far more financial sense at this point for Boeing to wash it’s hands of the Starliner (which is a cost-plus contract $1.4 bil over budget so far) and sell those remaining 6 ULA Atlas V’s to Amazon and/or other highest bidders, and use those pumped numbers to help sell off ULA (or at least for Boeing to exit and leave ULA entirely in Lockheed’s hands, which isn’t a bad play for either of them). Boeing leaving is so much more than Starliner, as they are the contractor for the Space Launch System (lol wsb won't me use it's real acronym cause it's a stock) Block 2 EUS ($2.4 bil already and they haven’t even built one), and even bigger yet, they are the contractor for the Space Launch System Block 1 Core Stages, which frankly is a deep dive all on it’s own. Suffice it to say, Boeing has received at least $10 bil for the 1^(st) of the 6 of these it needs to supply, and then after that the Block 2 Core Stage will be a Boeing/Grumman concern (of which Grumman can easily handle on it’s own).

Boeing has it’s fingers in a lot of the future NASA missions, but almost all of them involve much more highly experienced partners that can take over, and the two sole Boeing products (Starliner and Block 1 Cores) can be respectively canceled, and paired back (we don’t even have enough RS-25 engines to build the last 2 Cores, and only 2-4 are in production right now, it would be super easy to stop at 4)

So, stonks then. This mission has been a \*very\* public demonstration of technical ineptitude that has captured the attention of the American media and public. To paraphrase, 2 deaths is a tragedy, 346 deaths is statistics. To the general public, a couple of crashes overseas by airlines they never heard of isn’t going to move the needle like 2 certified American heroes being stranded in space, and yes, stranded is the right word. I have no idea what the BA stock will do (nor do I care, my position is 0 and always been, same with dear old dad), that’s for you apes to prognosticate.

I predict (based on the very publicly available “insider information” that is government contracts and NASA press releases), that NASA and Boeing will announce a cancellation of Starliner (and likely blame it on the short amount of time ISS has left and lack of need for the 6, nay 5, service missions), followed by more news on Boeing pulling the plug on all of it’s NASA commitments one joint venture at a time. Does that make Lockheed, Grumman, Sierra, and Blue Origin look more attractive for investment? And will Boeing “crash” because of filthy normals calling their brokers to sell, or will it go up based on selling off all their unprofitable spaceflight work to concentrate on building convertible airplanes? I dunno, you tell me down below.

I'm not saying these companies are good or bad. I'm not saying that BA is going up or down, but it's still very troubled. What I am saying is, do your homework here. If selling into Boeing's supply chain is a large part of a supplier's business, they could be vulnerable to weakness at Boeing no matter how well run that supplier might be.

Boeing has been unprofitable for a solid five years now. They are underwater by 18 billion. I'm not sure when a company like this stops paying its bills. If they do, the suppliers are in trouble.

Amazon Couldn't Deliver — Cloud Gains, Retail Pains

Amazon’s second-quarter earnings report has landed, and it's clear that even the mighty e-commerce giant isn’t immune to cautious consumer spending. The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.
iPads Shine, iPhones Stumble

Apple’s ($AAPL) bread and butter, the iPhone, which still accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales, saw a slight revenue decline year-over-year to $39.3 billion. While this was better than the $38.81 billion analysts expected, it's still a 1% drop, marking a slowdown in what’s usually Apple’s star performer.
But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.
Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

After Market Close:

AMC Entertainment Holdings ($AMC) might be a favorite among meme stock enthusiasts, but beneath the surface, the picture isn’t as rosy. The company is grappling with high debt, falling revenue, and ongoing unprofitability, which has led analysts to universally avoid recommending the stock. However, in the unpredictable world of meme stocks, all it takes is a few viral posts on Reddit for AMC to surge. Consensus estimates are -$0.47 EPS on $1.04 billion in revenue.

The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.
iPads Shine, iPhones Stumble

Apple’s ($AAPL) bread and butter, the iPhone, which still accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales, saw a slight revenue decline year-over-year to $39.3 billion. While this was better than the $38.81 billion analysts expected, it's still a 1% drop, marking a slowdown in what’s usually Apple’s star performer.
But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.
Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

After Market Close:

AMC Entertainment Holdings ($AMC) might be a favorite among meme stock enthusiasts, but beneath the surface, the picture isn’t as rosy. The company is grappling with high debt, falling revenue, and ongoing unprofitability, which has led analysts to universally avoid recommending the stock. However, in the unpredictable world of meme stocks, all it takes is a few viral posts on Reddit for AMC to surge. Consensus estimates are -$0.47 EPS on $1.04 billion in revenue.

But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.
Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

After Market Close:

AMC Entertainment Holdings ($AMC) might be a favorite among meme stock enthusiasts, but beneath the surface, the picture isn’t as rosy. The company is grappling with high debt, falling revenue, and ongoing unprofitability, which has led analysts to universally avoid recommending the stock. However, in the unpredictable world of meme stocks, all it takes is a few viral posts on Reddit for AMC to surge. Consensus estimates are -$0.47 EPS on $1.04 billion in revenue.

Amazon Couldn't Deliver — Cloud Gains, Retail Pains

Amazon’s second-quarter earnings report has landed, and it's clear that even the mighty e-commerce giant isn’t immune to cautious consumer spending. The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.

Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

Amazon Couldn't Deliver — Cloud Gains, Retail Pains

Amazon’s second-quarter earnings report has landed, and it's clear that even the mighty e-commerce giant isn’t immune to cautious consumer spending. The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.
iPads Shine, iPhones Stumble

Apple’s ($AAPL) bread and butter, the iPhone, which still accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales, saw a slight revenue decline year-over-year to $39.3 billion. While this was better than the $38.81 billion analysts expected, it's still a 1% drop, marking a slowdown in what’s usually Apple’s star performer.
But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.

1egr5f2_BA,BA,"Boeing reports wider-than-expected loss, weaker revenue","Boeing's second quarter results have left investors and analysts alike with furrowed brows, as the aerospace giant posted a wider loss and weaker revenue than anticipated. The challenges were widespread, affecting both its commercial airplane and defense segments, which have been plagued by programs running behind schedule and higher-than-expected costs.

The company is also grappling with increased federal scrutiny following an incident in January where a door plug blew out from a nearly new 737 Max 9. This event not only reignited safety concerns but also contributed to further delays in the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient jets to airlines.

In a strategic move to steady the ship, Boeing announced that Robert ""Kelly"" Ortberg, a more-than-three-decade veteran of the aerospace industry, will take over as CEO. Ortberg’s appointment comes as the company seeks to regain its footing amid these operational and financial headwinds. Current CEO Dave Calhoun, who has led the company through a turbulent period, will step down by the end of the year.

Boeing's Q2 Performance:

Boeing's performance in the second quarter fell short of analyst expectations, particularly in terms of profitability and revenue. Here's a breakdown:

Loss per share: Boeing reported an adjusted loss of $2.90 per share, which was significantly worse than the $1.97 per share loss that analysts had expected, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: The company generated $16.87 billion in revenue for the quarter, falling short of the expected $17.23 billion. This represented a 15% decline from the same period last year.

Net loss: Boeing's net loss for the quarter was a staggering $1.44 billion, or $2.33 per share, compared to a loss of $149 million, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, the loss per share was $2.90, nearly $1 per share worse than expected.

CEO Dave Calhoun, in an earnings release on Wednesday, acknowledged the difficult quarter but emphasized that the company is making ""substantial progress"" in strengthening its quality management system and positioning Boeing for the future.

Commercial Airplane Unit Struggles
Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit, once a strong performer, has been hit hard by production delays and low deliveries. The segment reported a 32% year-over-year drop in revenue, coming in at $6 billion for the quarter. These challenges have pushed back some of Boeing's key financial targets, with the company struggling to meet its production goals.

Despite these setbacks, Boeing remains committed to ramping up production of its 737 Max planes to 38 per month. However, analysts noted that the company was producing these jets at a rate in the mid-20s per month during the last quarter, highlighting the gap between its goals and current capabilities.

Defense Unit Faces Cost Overruns and Delays
Boeing’s defense segment didn’t fare much better. The unit reported a 2% decline in revenue for the second quarter, bringing in $6.02 billion. More concerning, however, was the segment's financial performance, as it posted a loss of $913 million during the period—nearly double the $527 million loss it recorded in the same quarter of 2023. Boeing attributed some of these losses to higher estimated engineering and manufacturing costs, as well as ongoing technical challenges.

One of the high-profile programs under this unit is the construction of two Boeing 747 aircraft that will serve as Air Force One. These planes are behind schedule, adding to the company’s woes.

Cash Flow Concerns

Adding to Boeing’s financial difficulties is its cash flow situation. The company reported a negative free cash flow of $4.3 billion for the second quarter, following a similar trend in the first quarter. CFO Brian West had previously warned in May that Boeing would continue to burn cash in the second quarter, largely due to lower-than-expected production and delivery rates.

Looking Ahead

As Boeing works to stabilize its operations and address the myriad challenges facing its business, the road ahead remains uncertain. The company's decision to bring in a seasoned leader like Robert Ortberg to steer the ship is a clear signal that Boeing is serious about turning things around. However, with ongoing scrutiny from regulators, delays in key programs, and financial pressures mounting, it will be a steep climb for the aerospace giant to regain its former glory.

1egkxwm_BA,BA,"Boeing reports wider-than-expected loss, weaker revenue ","Boeing reported a bigger loss and weaker revenue than analysts expected for the second quarter and lower revenue as both its commercial airplane and defense programs continued to struggle.

Here’s how Boeing performed in the second quarter compared with estimates compiled by LSEG:

Loss per share: $2.90 per share adjusted versus $1.97 per share adjusted.

Revenue: $16.87 billion versus $17.23 billion

“Despite a challenging quarter, we are making substantial progress strengthening our quality management system and positioning our company for the future,” CEO Dave Calhoun said in an earnings release on Wednesday.

Boeing is trying to regain its footing after a door plug blowout from a nearly-new 737 Max at the start of the year reignited additional scrutiny from regulators and further slowed deliveries of new, more fuel-efficient jets to airlines.

In addition to the impact from the door plug accident in January, Boeing, as well as rival Airbus, are dealing with thousands of new workers and a supply chain that can’t keep up with production demands after a demand plunge during the pandemic roiled their businesses.

Lower deliveries and production have pushed back some of Boeing’s financial targets. CFO Brian West warned in May that the company would likely burn another roughly $4 billion in the second quarter, similar to the first, largely due to lower production and delivery rates than expected. Boeing was producing its best-selling Max planes a pace in the mid-20s per month in the last few months, far from its target of 38 a month.

Stephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, told reporters ahead of the Farnborough Airshow outside London earlier this month that the company is trying to make lasting changes to training and quality control, admitting that the company has disappointed customers.

“We’ve impacted their business and we haven’t met the commitments and lived up to being the partner that they expect and they need us to be,” she said. “This plan is not a three-month plan,” said Pope. “I call it transformational because some of these actions will take years.”

Boeing’s other business units have also faced cost overruns and delays, like its defense unit which is building the two Boeing 747 aircraft that will serve as Air Force One, which are behind schedule.

1ebw9x1_BA,BA,DD: The case for Boeing ,"Here’s a comprehensive summary highlighting why Boeing ($BA) is a compelling investment opportunity:

1. **Government Backing**: Boeing is integral to the U.S. defense sector, ensuring substantial support and a safety net from the U.S. government.
2. **Duopoly Advantage**: Operating in a market dominated by only two major players—Boeing and Airbus—minimizes competitive threats, with demand consistently outstripping supply.
3. **Attractive Valuation**: Currently trading near its 52-week low, Boeing’s improved quality control and stringent regulatory oversight reduce the risk of operational missteps. Average Analyst Price Target in wall street for Boeing is currently $220
4. **Resumed Deliveries to China**: For the first time since 2019, Boeing has resumed aircraft deliveries to China, signaling renewed market opportunities.
5. **Strategic Contracts**: Recent significant deals with Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Macquarie showcase Boeing’s strong order pipeline and global demand.
6. **Leadership Changes**: The anticipated arrival of a new CEO is expected to bring fresh strategic direction and potential operational enhancements.
7. **Geopolitical Favorability**: A potential Trump presidency could boost defense contracts for Boeing. However, the current geopolitical climate suggests robust defense spending under any administration.
8. **Robust Backlog**: As of April, Boeing has a backlog of 6,259 aircraft orders, excluding recent deals with China, Qatar, and the UAE, ensuring steady future revenues.
9. **737 Max Saga is Over**: The case has been settled, and the penalty is negligible for a company like Boeing.

 — 
Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft was set to mark its crowning achievement this month: Ferrying two NASA astronauts on a round trip to the International Space Station, proving the long-delayed and over-budget capsule is up for the task.

Starliner is halfway to that goal.

But the two veteran astronauts piloting this test flight are now in a tentative position — extending their stay aboard the space station for a second time while engineers on the ground scramble to learn more about issues that plagued the first leg of their journey.

Spaceflight veterans Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the space station aboard the Starliner on June 6. NASA initially projected their stay would last about a week.

But troubles the vehicle experienced en route, including helium leaks and thrusters that abruptly stopped working, have raised questions about how the back half of the mission will play out.


Williams and Wilmore will now return no earlier than June 26, NASA announced Tuesday, stretching their mission to at least 20 days as engineers race to gain a better understanding of the spacecraft’s problems while it’s safely attached to the space station.


Officials have said there is no reason to believe Starliner won’t be able to bring the astronauts back home, though “we really want to work through the remainder of the data,” said Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, at a Tuesday news conference.

The Boeing Starliner spacecraft docks to the International Space Station on June 6, 2024.

Astronauts’ return delayed again as Boeing and NASA try to learn more about spacecraft issues
Meanwhile, Boeing has sought to frame the mission as a success and learning opportunity, albeit one that has left the Starliner team grappling with the “unplanned” side of the mission, as Mark Nappi, Boeing’s vice president and program manager of the Starliner program, put it Tuesday.

It’s not uncommon for astronauts to unexpectedly extend their stay aboard the space station — for days, weeks or even months. (NASA has also said the Starliner can spend up to 45 days at the orbiting laboratory if needed, according to Stich.)

But the situation makes for a moment of uncertainty and embarrassment that joins a long list of similar blunders by the Boeing Starliner program, which is already years behind schedule. It also adds to a chorus of unfavorable news that has followed Boeing as a company for some time.

A nail-biting finale
Boeing and NASA engineers said they are opting to leave Starliner — and with it, Williams and Wilmore — aboard the station longer than expected primarily to carry out additional analysis. The helium leaks and thruster issues occurred on a part of the vehicle that is not intended to survive the trip home from space, so mission teams are delaying the spacecraft’s return as part of a last-ditch effort to learn everything they can about what went wrong.

Danger looms any time a spacecraft returns home from orbit. It is perhaps the most perilous stretch of any mission to space.

The trip will require the Starliner to hit Earth’s thick atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound. The process will bake the spacecraft’s exterior at roughly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

Then, a set of parachutes — which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January — must safely slow the capsule down before it reaches terra firma. (Starliner will be the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the Starliner after flight.)

A series of setbacks
Starliner’s journey to this historic crewed test mission began in 2014 when NASA tapped both Boeing and SpaceX to develop a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.

At the time, Boeing was seen as the stalwart aerospace giant that would likely get the job done first while SpaceX was the unpredictable newcomer.

Over the past decade, however, tides have shifted.


SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft safely completed its first crewed mission — which appeared to go off without a hitch — in 2020. And the vehicle has been regularly flying astronauts and paying customers since.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft launched NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station, marking the spacecraft's inaugural crewed flight, on May 30, 2020.

The two astronauts that piloted Crew Dragon’s inaugural flight — Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley — also stayed aboard the space station longer than expected, notching more than 60 days rather than the brief stint expected on such test flights.

But Hurley and Behnken’s stay was extended so that the astronauts could lend a hand with daily activities aboard the space station, which at the time was understaffed. The extension did not directly relate to specific software or hardware problems with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.

Spacecraft issues, on the other hand, have marred Boeing’s Starliner program practically every step of the way. The vehicle has faced years of delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.

The first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.

A second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle’s thrusters.

Stich, the NASA program manager, indicated during a June 6 news conference that it’s possible engineers may not have completely resolved those issues from 2022.

“We thought we had fixed that problem,” Stich said, adding, “I think we’re missing something fundamental that’s going on inside the thruster.”

Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering associate professor of practice at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was a consultant for Boeing’s spaceflight division from 2009 to 2014, told CNN that it would be difficult to determine whether additional ground tests may have caught the thruster issues at hand.

But Lembeck emphasized that evaluating the success of this test mission is not as simple as comparing it directly with the inaugural crewed test flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.

Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Starship missions both hit spaceflight milestones this week
For example, he said, SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule — a direct predecessor of Crew Dragon — completed more than a decade of uncrewed cargo missions to the space station before Crew Dragon took flight.


“SpaceX did have a head start with the cargo program,” Lembeck said. “I think they do have an advantage that Boeing did not have. Boeing’s kind of having to build a crew vehicle all up from scratch.”

Should this Starliner test mission encounter additional setbacks, however, it could put Boeing in a situation where it must rely on its rival to get Williams and Wilmore home.

“The embarrassing backup is that a Crew Dragon would have to go and retrieve the astronauts,” Lembeck said. The spacecraft “could be sent up with two crew members and sent back with four — and that would probably be the way home.”

Boeing’s broader problems
Boeing executives have repeatedly sought to make clear that the Starliner program operates independently from the company’s other units — including the commercial aircraft division that has been at the center of scandals for years.

“We have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,” Nappi said during a news briefing in April before Starliner took flight.

Nappi at the time also declared that the Starliner team was operating at “peak performance” and “really looking forward to executing” a safe mission.

When asked about that assertion on Tuesday, Stich, the NASA executive, said that officials at Boeing and NASA had always expected to find additional issues that needed to be hashed out during this test flight.


Williams had alluded to that expectation during a pre-flight news conference, saying, “We always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff.

“Everything’s not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. …We feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those,” Williams said.

Stich, however, acknowledged on Tuesday that Boeing and NASA might have been able to prevent some of the hangups the Starliner has encountered: “Perhaps we could have done different testing on the ground to characterize some of (the thruster issues) ahead of time,” he s",2024-06-21,660,129

I see Boeing trading down on pretty much every single “whistleblower news”. It’s not whistleblowing when it is the company itself asking for EVERYTHING on the table!

What you don’t seem to realize is the news isn’t even news. It’s TRANSPARENCY from their own “speak up” system, a QA system  which has been put there in place to better the company long term, BECAUSE everybody have whined about them for years now, especially politicians and media, to BETTER the company and get RID OF THE PROBLEMS of THE PAST! A bad culture dating back to the stupid decision to outsource and spin off spirit aero systems for instance and many more stupid decisions of MANAGEMENT OF THE PAST! What timeline do you think they operate on? It’s decades!

Well see the stock market isn’t about the past, it’s about the future! What simplywallstreet and many other value investors understand is that the company is massively undervalued because of current momentum and past problems, but we aren’t working with the past! On future cash flow and earnings Boeing is one of the best value buys in the entire market! Demand is massive and problems are being rooted out like bad teeth.

A lot of people are out to sink the stock further looking to discount their future purchases, not much else! ",2024-06-18,0,87
1ddtc94_BA,BA,BA  (BOEING) DD. Boeing sales tumble as the company gets no orders for the 737 Max for the second straight month,"Boeing
 received orders for only four new planes in May — and for the second straight month, none for its best-selling 737 Max, as fallout continues from the blowout of a side panel on a Max during a flight in January.

The results released Tuesday compared unfavorably with Europe’s Airbus, which reported orders for 27 new planes in May 

Boeing also saw Aerolineas Argentinas cancel an order for a single Max jet, bringing its net sales for the month to three.

The dismal results followed poor figures for April, when Boeing reported seven sales — none of them for the Max.

Boeing hopes that the slow pace of orders reflects a lull in sales before next month’s Farnborough International Airshow, where aircraft deals are often announced.

But the Federal Aviation Administration is capping Boeing’s production of 737s after a door plug blew out from an Alaska Airlines Max, allegations by whistleblowers that Boeing has taken shortcuts to produce planes more quickly, and reports of falsified inspection records on some 787 Dreamliner jets.

Boeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, delivered 24 jetliners in May, including 19 Max jets. Ireland’s Ryanair got four and Alaska Airlines took three. Airbus said it delivered 53 planes last month.

1bdusxk_BA,BA,will BA become AI central Ford," let's see the numbers first 

https://preview.redd.it/n3bsihexc4oc1.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=f02b76a2fff52f2972154c65466c1642ddce6d08

BA and Ford are great company. but if you want to do investment research, you need find the trend quickly and in right position.

While Boeing may not be considered a high-tech company in the same vein as some software or technology firms, its engineering expertise and technology advancements in areas like fuel efficiency and aerodynamics are still important factors in its competitiveness and potential for future growth. 

similar words we said to Ford at 1990s. then after year 2000, we went to computer central. cars are made by Roberto arms. And didn't catch EV, market price just with low P/S.

Here are couple reasons to support BA high price:

 

1. Expectations of future recovery and profitability: Boeing is a major aerospace company with a strong history and market position. Investors may be betting that the company's recent struggles are temporary, and that it will be able to turn things around and return to profitability in the coming years.
2. Revenue and cash flow: While net income has been negative, Boeing still generates significant revenue from its commercial and defense operations. As long as the company can cover its costs and generate positive cash flow, it can continue operating and investing in future growth.
3. Backlog and order book: Boeing has a sizeable backlog of orders for commercial aircraft, which provides visibility into future revenue streams. This backlog can support the stock price, as investors anticipate these orders being fulfilled and generating cash flow.
4. Potential for cost-cutting and restructuring: Boeing has announced plans to cut costs and restructure its operations, which could improve profitability if executed successfully.
5. Expectations of growth in the aviation industry: Despite current challenges, the aviation industry is generally expected to grow in the long term, driven by increasing air travel demand. This growth potential could benefit Boeing as a leading aircraft manufacturer.
6. Diversified business: Boeing's defense and space operations provide a diversified revenue stream, which can help offset cyclical downturns in the commercial aviation business.

 

all above reason is now weak. even it's duopoly role won't help too much. You can see these company have almost same employee number but Boeing net income is negative. so either cut employee number or management need change. With AI being used in all industry, it's defense and space operation share will lost a lot. and it's commercial airplane will same as Ford capital-intensive with lower expected growth rates.

Since P/E doesn't work for Boeing, us P/S to calculate price, P/S eventually will go to 1 which means price may close to $127.

let's compare BA vs. F chart

191ioon_BA,BA,Shares of Boeing open down 8% following FAA grounding dozens of Boeing 737 Max 9 Planes,"Shares of Boeing fell in premarket trade Monday, as markets digested the news that the Federal Aviation Administration had ordered a temporary grounding of dozens of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft.

  
Shares were down more than 8% in early hours trading by 5:05 a.m. ET.

  
The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday said around 171 planes worldwide would be affected by its emergency airworthiness directive, which requires aircraft to be inspected before flying again. The order applies to U.S. airlines and carriers operating in U.S. territory.

  
It was issued after a piece of a plane blew out in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight on Friday.

  
Images shared on social media showed a hole in the side of the aircraft and passengers using oxygen masks. The flight — Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 — returned to Portland shortly after departing for Ontario, California.

  
The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the blowout.

  
“Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB’s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.

  
Of the 171 aircraft grounded under the directive, United Airlines has 79 and Alaska 65, while the remaining 74 are spread across six other airlines. The 178-seater aircraft that suffered a blowout on Friday was delivered to Alaska Airlines on Nov. 11th.

1. **244.72** (25% Fib retrace) + **240(ish)** was resistance from 7/28 - 8/10
2. **232.67** (38.2% Fib)
3. **221.90** (50% Fib) + **220(ish)** was resistance from Feb - July 2023 + upsloping TL (connect AUG 22 high to May 23 low)
4. **211.12** (61.8% Fib) +  **215(ish)** (100 DMA) + **213(ish)** (200 DMA)
5. **199.07** (75% Fib) + TL that was both support (Feb - May 23) and resistance (Oct/Nov 23) + would be a similar drop to what price did from Aug - Oct 23

Bounced from 290s to as high as 420. Then the Max groundings. It’s been issue after issue. This grounding is just one of a slew since 2019.
I wouldn’t be surprised if this extends to FAA and all 737-9s.

23 shares down 27% in my retirement account, I would have taken the loss if I could, but just bag holding as seems no point in this account, just sit it out till recovers. Yet i feel like I’m one grounding away from closing and just putting the money into SP.

Fucking Boeing.

Rant over.

17ebjyl_KLAC,KLAC,"Expected Moves: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Snap, Boeing and more.","SPY was down 2.5% last week, more than the 1.8% move options were pricing. Despite the day-to-day volatility, it is only down about 1.6% on the month. Speaking of the day-to-day volatility, intraday volatility has been even more extreme, adding to the feeling of a wild market even though it hasn't necessarily cracked or seen panic selling overall. However, certain sectors have seen steep declines recently, and the VIX is now near 22, its highest level since March. As was the case with September expiry, this week begins a new vol/gamma regime where some of the strikes that may have been acting as support or even magnets over the past week or so have expired. Keep an eye not only on the VIX this week but also the 0DTE expected moves. Currently SPY 0DTe expected moves are approaching 1% and QQQ is now over 1% each day. Several days last week the markets moved that amount in both directions, multiple times in a day.

16xue81_BA,BA,Thoughts on Boeing after recent drop?,"BA got hammered in the recent weeks and it appears to be quite undervalued. I am wondering if this is a good time to buy it for a longer term. 

Yes, BA currently has a lot of problems. (Jet another round of) 737 production issues, 777x delays, 787 issues earlier this year, ... On the other hand they are seeing strong demand and are increasing production and deliveries. Airlines can't just switch to Airbus since their order books are full for years to come too and they are struggling with increasing production numbers as well. 

I guess the main question one should ask is whether Boeing will eventually resolve all problems that it is currently fighting with or keep facing more and more of them. 

What are the thoughts of r/investing?",2023-10-02,109,83

**Last Week – Late rally saves the week.**

SPY was lower by about 0.6% last week but ended on a strong note with a near 2% rally off its lows of the week on Thursday. The move on the week was inside the 1.3% move options were pricing. The VIX ended thr week unchanged as did near-term IV, with SPY options still in the low to mid-teens for the next two weeks. Things change the first week of February as we hear from the FOMC and see the latest employment and inflation data. Those weeks have consistently seen higher IV across the market, looking almost like a monthly earnings report on the expected move chart (Feb 3rd IV highlighted, note the bulge in the expected move chart for that week):

**This Week – Again, relatively Low IV into this week’s earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we’ve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

Looking at some of the big names reporting this week, we see MSFT options 41 IV versus about 36 realized vol for the past year. So MSFT options are pricing a move for earnings slightly more than an average week (but not by much). TSLA options are similar, 81 IV this week versus 67 realized the past year. INTC options stick out as quite pumped versus the past year. IV for this week is 67 versus 39 realized for the past year. INTC has actually moved a lot on its recent earnings, with moves of +10%, -9%, -7%, and 7% (with the +10% most recent). That helps explain this week’s 7% expected move.

So looking at those 3 examples, there are none that are as low as the situation we saw last week in GS, but among the three MSFT options are the cheapest versus last year’s realized and INTC’s are the most expensive, needing a move similar to what the stock saw its past 4 earnings in order for options to not have been overpriced. As an example of a neutral trade, selling that earnings move, an Iron Condor expiring this Friday in INTC would currently need the stock to close the week between 26.80 and 31.20 following its report to see max gain. Here’s how that looks on a 3-month stock chart (see [this trade ](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/INTC/iron-condor)and others on Options AI’s free trade tool):

**Last Week – Late rally saves the week.**

SPY was lower by about 0.6% last week but ended on a strong note with a near 2% rally off its lows of the week on Thursday. The move on the week was inside the 1.3% move options were pricing. The VIX ended thr week unchanged as did near-term IV, with SPY options still in the low to mid-teens for the next two weeks. Things change the first week of February as we hear from the FOMC and see the latest employment and inflation data. Those weeks have consistently seen higher IV across the market, looking almost like a monthly earnings report on the expected move chart (Feb 3rd IV highlighted, note the bulge in the expected move chart for that week):

**This Week – Again, relatively Low IV into this week’s earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we’ve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

**This Week – Again, relatively Low IV into this week’s earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we’ve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

Looking at some of the big names reporting this week, we see MSFT options 41 IV versus about 36 realized vol for the past year. So MSFT options are pricing a move for earnings slightly more than an average week (but not by much). TSLA options are similar, 81 IV this week versus 67 realized the past year. INTC options stick out as quite pumped versus the past year. IV for this week is 67 versus 39 realized for the past year. INTC has actually moved a lot on its recent earnings, with moves of +10%, -9%, -7%, and 7% (with the +10% most recent). That helps explain this week’s 7% expected move.

So looking at those 3 examples, there are none that are as low as the situation we saw last week in GS, but among the three MSFT options are the cheapest versus last year’s realized and INTC’s are the most expensive, needing a move similar to what the stock saw its past 4 earnings in order for options to not have been overpriced. As an example of a neutral trade, selling that earnings move, an Iron Condor expiring this Friday in INTC would currently need the stock to close the week between 26.80 and 31.20 following its report to see max gain. Here’s how that looks on a 3-month stock chart (see [this trade ](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/INTC/iron-condor)and others on Options AI’s free trade tool):

uukrns_BA,BA,Anyone else think Boeing (BA) is a great long term investment if you can deal with the volatility?,"Boeing stock has been one of the worst performers and is nearing its Covid lows. But I think in the next 5-7 years the stock could be worth a lot more as a turn-around play. My cost basis is 145, so I am down on my position a decent amount, and it could definitely go lower before it recovers. 

The company does not have a PE ratio at the moment, but the price to sales is below 1.5. It has a wide moat and is basically a duopoly with Airbus. The  non-commercial aerospace and defense segment is still doing well. Even with new Covid concerns and a possible recession that hits many countries, air travel is expected to return close to normal in the next couple of years and the orders for new jets reflects this. The company is expected to return to profitability later this year or early next year. 

I understand that a lot is not going well with the company at the moment. But it's not like it's some company with tons of competition or in a dying industry. It seems from a longterm valuation, approaching the 2020 Covid lows seems unjustified for the stock.",2022-05-21,7,41

tjg3cw_BA,BA,Buy BA,"My positions to start: 2024 Jan 170-200 Call Spreads, 25 shares, and adding more shares. 


A 737-800 crashed in china as many of you have probably heard and BA stock has sank. 

I would speculate confidently that the sell off was a knee jerk reaction due to people thinking it was another MAX, but it was not, it was the 800 variant. 

Furthermore, being a pilot myself, i dont see how this will fall on Boeing. This will likely be determined to be pilot error, as aviation authorities and airlines love to put the final blame on the pilot whenever they can. In this case, from what ive seen in the video, there is absolutely no way for an airplane to be descending at 30000 fpm like a missile straight into the ground from a manufacturers malfunction, considering the aircrafts age/variant, the only times ive seen this are either A) maintenance fucked up (i.e - the alaska airlines flight) or B) the pilots out the aircraft in an inadvertent attitude that became unrecoverable. 


*edit: the flight data recorder previously posted is incorrect. My thesis this was pilot error, however, has not changed*


In short, this will not fall on Boeing and likely pilot error, unfortunately. 

Buy BA because it will rebound.

pfkju9_BA,BA,BA Chart Analysis - Options Swing Trade Potential,"[Here] (https://imgur.com/a/Ley6LD0) we have the daily chart for Boeing which is showing a wide downtrend formation. Within this downtrend formation, price seems to be consolidating right in the middle of a previous support level (which was broken out of). 

What does this mean for BA? 
1. Price continues to consolidate until we reach the end of our triangle formation and choose a direction to move.
2. Once this moves, its going to move a lot
3. This is a very strong downward trend, with multiple touches both on the resistance and support levels. 

So how do you profit off this setup?
1. WAIT for the price to exit the triangle formation. In this situation I do not see the need to wait for a retest candle as there isnt much support below it or above it besides our trendline levels. 
2. If it breaks to the downside, Im buying 3-4 week out Puts maybe 210 strike or lower depending on the strength of the move. 
3. If the move matches with my prediction and the way that BA has been moving within this channel, we can see a break down to around the $196 level by around the 2nd week of September.

I get that BA is very headline sensitive stock, and the plane in Hawaii didn't help. But, a few ""news"" stories have been awfully misleading as they were already disclosed by Boeing weeks ago...

Technical analysis shows a good buy signal now.  Stochastics, RSI and MACD all are pretty low (see screenshot).  BA appears to be recently over the past year cyclical with it's stock price, and the technical indicators are now suggesting that it's going to go up in the next few weeks.  I don't think the MACD is super reliable indicator in this point....but the slow stochastic is near an all time low.  It does not spend much time below 20 over the past year.  It's only been there 7 times.

kkxzdj_MRNA,MRNA,"Candlestick Patterns and the Way They Should be Taught | Examples of TSLA, MRNA, BA, QQQ, HD","This is a copy of a [**blog post**](https://tradytics.com/blog/candlestick-patterns-and-the-way-they-should-be-taught) I recently wrote on our website. I feel like this would be very helpful to new retail traders. Happy to take any feedback. Talked about $TSLA, $HD, $MRNA, $BA, and $QQQ.

If you search on google for the keyword [**Candlestick Patterns**](https://www.google.com/search?q=candlestick+patterns),  I am quite certain that you will find a plethora of posts and videos  talking about hundreds of different candlestick patterns with very  complex names. From spinning tops to shooting stars, every single type   of candlestick will have a pattern associated with it. I have never  personally understood the reasoning behind giving such complex names to  these patterns. After having read about 20 books on technical analysis  and price action, I have an unpopular opinion that these names do not  matter, and same is the case with a vast majority of candlestick  patterns. I spend most of my time in a day reading charts and I can  assure you that I don't remember more than 2 or 3 candlestick patterns  by their names. The reason I wanted to write this blog post is to change  this culture of drilling these patterns into retail traders without  explaining why they work. There so many charlatans that claim of being  technical analysis experts and charge thousands of dollars. Having done  thousands of backtests over the last 20 years, I can assure you with  100% confidence that relying on any single technical indicator or  candlestick pattern will never work in the long run. Despite that, these  patterns are still good to have in your arsenal because they can  sometimes help infer and predict price action. Let us go over some  candlestick patterns and try to understand why they work. But before  that, for new traders, we need to define what a candlestick is.

## A Candlestick

Looking at [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/), this is the definition of a [candlestick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) that we find.

>A candlestick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis  that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a  specific period.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xs293m5f0o761.png?width=1757&format=png&auto=webp&s=39eb22284fb144e3ceddd526c873986077867848

Candlesticks are important because they show us the battle of bulls and  bears. If a price opens lower and ends up higher (green candle), that  depicts that bulls are in control. Similarly, if the price opens lower,  goes up very high but eventually closes lower as well, that means bulls  tries to take control but bears defeated them. This is how I believe  everyone should think about candlestick patterns. You will realize that  having this type of thinking will help you understand these patterns  instead of simply cramming their names and looking for them everywhere.  Now that we have created a simple framework that we are going to use,  let us go over some examples to drill this deep into your minds. Before  we go to the section, it is pertinent that you always remember the  importance of risk management when you are learning technical analysis  and candlestick patterns. In your trading career, you will find out that  most of these patterns only work about half the time or less. When they  don't work, you need to have good risk management to get out of bad  positions. Risk management is the holy grail of trading. Please do not  forget that.

## Battles of Bulls and Bears

## [TSLA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=TSLA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8349r1ie0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d89a6b2ea4978416cdafe4b898ad9a2fbe60d4

Instead of naming different candlestick patterns, we are going to do  something different here. We are going to look at a few charts and see  if there are any patterns that can illustrate how the battle between  bulls and bears worked out.

There are four instances in this chart where a good battle took place  between bears and bulls. In the first instance, we can see that the  price was rallying for a few days. However, on November 27th, 2020, the  price started low, went up very high but ended up very low as well. That  tells us that bulls were in control at one point in the day but bears  took control and defeated bulls thus closing the price close to the low  of the day. In the next few days, we can see a reversal happen. On the  next three instances, we observed a very similar pattern. Digressing a  bit here, there's a great quotation, ""Price has memory"" that you need to  remember. If a certain patter/type of battle keeps appearing on a  chart, it has a much higher probability of panning out as compared to  one-time battle.

On points 2, 3, and 4, we can see that we had a short term downtrend  and the bears tried to make the trend continue. However, bulls took over  and brought the price from a very low to either a middle ground or  close to the high of the day. In the following days, we can see  reversals happening

## [HD Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=HD)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dohldhwd0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=8708bec4efd15c26fc222b1d57273c0b3d6f2d6f

So many things to learn from this chart. Let us start with point number  1 where we saw what folks call a ""Bearish Engulfing Candle"". In layman  terms, that simply means that the bears were able to get the price down  to ever lower the low of the previous day all the way from the top.  People call this an engulfing candle because it sort of engulfs the  previous candle. Sometimes, these candles can start a new short term  trend as we can see here. After the engulfing by bears, the price went  down.

The second point is actually very interesting and one of the higher  probability setups you will find. When price continues to go in a trend  for a long period of time before we see a candle where the opposite  party completely defeats the trending party, we usually see a reversal  from there. That is exactly what you see after point number 2. The  reason this happened was because bulls had tried their hard to get the  price up but bears were dominating and made the price go to the very low  of the candle. I do not want to name these candles a lot but people  usually call this an inverted hammer. Again, as you can now see, no one  should really remember the names as there are so many. Once you  understand what happens, it's easy to spot patterns.

Points 3, 4, and 5 are very similar and goes back to finding similar  setups on a chart to increase probabilities. There were three times when  the price was going in a downtrend before we got an indecision candle  or a candle where bears were exhausted and bulls took over. After all  such candles, we saw a reversal.

## [MRNA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=MRNA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h1we3bfd0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00b690f54f33e729c04e700dfe0b63e4786fe3c

With Moderna, we again see two bearish candles that engulfed the  previous bullish candles. After the first candle, we immediately had an  indecision candle where bulls and bears could not decide what to do.  However, we had another engulfing candle at point 2 that started a  downtrend. One thing to note here is that on a larger timeframe such as a  weekly chart, the first engulfing candle would be enough to see that it  started a longer term downtrend. After that candle, the price has never  gone above the high of the candle. This is how we can gauge bullish and  bearish pressure based on different candles to see if we should go long  or short on a stock.

## [QQQ Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=QQQ)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0xcylfxc0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0add93777473c0718865e3966c0c2d33f3bfad

Indices are slightly hard to trade solely based on candlestick  patterns. However, we can see some pretty clear ones here that I wanted  to discuss. The first two patterns were candles where bulls wanted to  continue their run but bears defeated them getting the price close to  the low of the candles. That initiated a short term downtrend.

The third is an interesting point where we again saw a bearish  engulfing which started a slightly longer term downtrend. There are many  small patterns after this candle such as an indecision green candle  that started an uptrend, a hammer like candle that was a fake  candlestick because the uptrend continued. Hammer like candlesticks are  usually thought of as reversal patterns but they can also be thought of  as bulls defeating the bears and price can potentially continue higher,  which it did here.

Finally, the fourth point is again a hammer like candlestick that led  to a big reversal. As I said previously, hammer like candles are mostly  used to find reversals. But since the price went down and eventually  came back, it also sometimes shows that bullish pressure is still there.  The reason most people use them as reversal signals is that it gives us  a sign of caution because there was a time when bears were able to get  the price to the very low of the candle. Although bulls defeated bears  for that particular candle, just the indication of bearish pressure is  sometimes enough to infer a reversal.

## [BA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=BA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iqrflac0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=8246cecf6af6f0a6e4a5a5f7c2740d40a5be2e1b

When you start finding candlestick patterns on charts, one thing you  will realize is that there are many fakeouts i.e patterns that don't pan  out immediately or don't pan out at all. There are many theories behind  why this happens. One reason is that since most people know that retail  traders are going to follow these patterns, they fake them to create  liquidity in the market because people immediately start buying and  selling on these patterns. Another reason is that these patterns are  just not universal. They can show the battle between bulls and bears but  new events, news, and other things come up that can affect that  pressure.

In Boeing's chart, we can see that we had a huge indecision candle  where bulls and bears could not decide which way to go. After a good up  or downtrend, an indecision is a sign of reversal because the trending  party is losing momentum. That is what we would have expected there but  look at the large green candle the next day, which was a fake candle.  After that, the price indeed started to go in a downtrend.

## Final Thoughts

That is it. This was a short introduction to how retail traders should  go about looking at candlesticks to gauge bullish and bearish pressure. I  personally learned this way of looking at candlesticks from this  amazing book by Alexander Elder called [The New Trading for a Living](https://www.amazon.com/New-Trading-Living-Psychology-Discipline/dp/1118443926).  The book goes into length on many things we have discussed in this  post. Please note that I have no affiliation with the author.

Finally, I would like to urge retail traders to spend time learning to  read price action because it is an important skill to have in your  arsenal. People forget that almost all technical indicators are simply  extensions of price action since they are calculated based on the price  and volume. Therefore, if you understand the tension between bulls and  bears well, you will not need any technical indicators. Most of the  examples we see in this post are also on daily charts. The same  principles hold for weekly charts, intraday charts, or any other time  period.",2020-12-27,89,18

&#x200B;

I was planning to run the wheel on BA son bought 100 shares last week at $147 and immediately sold a $157.5c 6/19 againsts them for $466. Obviously BA spiked this morning so I decided to move the covered call up so I bought out of the $157.5c for $735 and sold a 167.5c for $366.

&#x200B;

So my net gain on the options is only $90 now but my stike is $10 higher so I've gained $1000 in the value of the stock.

&#x200B;

Now BA kept going up and is now about $176 so I'm thinking of buying out of my $167.5c and selling a $175c for a net loss of $400 but should the shares get called way I'd make a extra $750, so it should be a net gain of $350.  If BA drops below $175 by 6/19 I'll keep the shares and sell another call next month.

* 129/145 debit call spread, originally $578 is now $787, a gain of 36%
* 129/115 credit put spread, originally $525 is now $290, a 45% gain, but versus risk of $875 a return of 26%.

This is a very good demonstration of the differences between the 3 most common ways to play on a bullish price target, and using the expected move to your advantage.

>SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Saturday said it had canceled a $4.2 billion deal to buy the commercial jets division of Embraer (EMBR3.SA), unraveling years of work on what the Brazilian planemaker expected to be a transformative move.

Does this reflect a strategic effort that will give shareholders optimism about Boeing's financial security, or does it suggest a ""bad news to come"" scenario?

$BA shares hit a low of $128.39 yesterday, after they announced production cuts and pushback of timeline to bring back the MAX fixes.

**Edits:** 

I wonder how much of this is to free up money to pay debt that is going to be [due in 2020](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339778-boeing-737-max-bailout)?

>**Boeing short-term debt and interest payments**  
>  
>The next portion is Boeing's borrowings, and that is obviously what brought the company in problems with another crisis hitting many industries; Boeing borrowed $25.4B in 2019 and fully used its $13.8B credit facility. From the $25.4B, $12.2B was used to make debt repayment. Boeing's current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt is $7.3B. While many companies are now tapping into their credit lines, Boeing already did that last year, which, by no means, is a positive indication. I also modeled in Boeing tapping its $9.6B revolving credit facility, of which $3.2B is due by the end of October 2020, though Boeing does have the ability to extend the termination times by a year.  
>  
>I estimated that Boeing would pay around $800-950 million in interest on their debt at the end of 2019 and a hefty $1B fee on their $13.8B delayed drawdown arrangement as well as a significant fee on the credit line agreements.

***Further, some speculation that Embraer say's this agreement was wrongfully terminated:***

>[Embraer believes strongly t](https://leehamnews.com/2020/04/25/embraer-boeing-wrongfully-terminated-jv-will-seek-remedies/)hat Boeing has wrongfully terminated the MTA, that it has manufactured false claims as a pretext to seek to avoid its commitments to close the transaction and pay Embraer the US$4.2 billion purchase price. We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the MTA, because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction in light of its own financial condition and 737 MAX and other business and reputational problems.

>Embraer believes strongly that Boeing has wrongfully terminated the (agreement), that it has manufactured false claims as a pretext to seek to avoid its commitments to close the transaction and pay Embraer the US$4.2 billion purchase price,” Embraer said. “We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the (agreement) because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction in light of its own financial condition and 737 MAX and other business and reputational problems.”

I've written some CSPs way OTM just to get a feel for things (such as TSLA $5p) but am considering moving a bit closer to ITM (without getting too risky) for stocks I wouldn't mind owning longer term.

If I were to write a CSP for BA $50p 6/19, as of now I'd get about $86 in premium but $5000 put on the sideline in case it gets exercised.

Other than tying up the $5000 for ~2 months, the only other downside is if Boeing drops below $50, the chances of which seem small but I could be wrong. If it did drop that low I'd be fine with taking the stock as I can't imagine they'd go bankrupt. Bailout would happen before that though terms of that might wipe out shareholders so that's a risk too.

Assuming I held to expiration and they expire worthless, it would be about a 10.7% annualized return, correct?

Anyway, just wanted to bounce this off smarter minds than myself. Not looking to get rich quick but seems like a decent gain in terms of annualized % for not a huge amount of risk.

Boeing is still getting orders for aircraft, despite their MAX debacle. Remember how hard their stock jumped just on news of reopening their factory in Washington? The fact of the matter is that despite BA's poor performance, they are nearly a monopoly in the world of combat aircraft. We will still continue to see orders like this, and that marks a positive sentiment for BA.

I had already purchased BA 7/17 300C on Friday. I hope this news causes a decent uptick on Monday. I think in the current situation, at least until we see whether COVID returns with a vengeance when we attempt to reopen, that BA can only really go up at the time being.",2020-04-19,229,120

b03hv7_BA,BA,Surviving the Boeing crash,"A Boeing plane crashed this weekend. Unfortunately, I was short seven BA strangles. The most relevant strikes

3 March 360 puts, 1 March 400 put

3 April 360 puts

When the market opened BA down about 12 percent, my account down about 3 percent. My BA delta about 250. Yikes. I was close to delta neutral on Friday and that has been my idea.

About 20 minutes into trading I cover the March 400 put for a monumental loss. Normally I close when the strike gets breached. I also closed 2 of the March 360s and 2 April 360s. At this point BA was about 379, my delta now about 45, which I saw as manageable.

Obviously that did not work out so well, because I covered sold puts at 379 and BA closed at 400. Still, there is a benefit to acting mechanically when faced with a three standard deviation move. The alternatives are to abandon the plan, to freeze, perhaps jeopardize the entire account.

I ended the day down 1.5 percent, long about 15 delta on BA  BA wasn't the only fire to put out. The huge rally pressured sold calls on other underlyings. With hindsight, it would have been better in this case to wait. But that wasn't the plan, and I had way too much risk after the gap. 

I always tell people to follow their plan. Altering the plan after a huge move on news tends to be a terrible idea. The result might boil down to a coin flip, but the long term damage from abandoning the plan is large.

If, God forbid a third plane crashes, BA might be gap down another 60 points in a blink. Yes, a low probability event, but not exactly a zero probability one given the circumstances.

Rule number one is: live to trade another day. Down 1.5 percent on a three standard deviation move where I have a substantial position, means that I can move on.",2019-03-12,180,75

aziftv_BA,BA,Will $BA’s Entire 737 MAX Fleet be Grounded in the Coming Weeks?,"Boeing ($BA) is hitting my radar hard this weekend after the Ethiopian Air crash on a brand new 737 MAX. The likely culprit is a faulty angle of attack (AOA) indicator which is the same indicator that brought down the Lions Air crash last year. 

In the event of a stall, flying 101 tells you to nose down to create more lift under the wings thereby reversing the stall. The AOA indicator has an autocorrect feature that is supposed to inch the nose down when it observes stall conditions, so you can imagine what happens when the indicator is faulty and the pilot can’t manually override in time.

I’m simplifying the explanation here, but the important piece is that the faulty AOA sensor is built into the 737 MAX, the fastest selling Boeing aircraft in its history.  If the AOA sensor issue is indeed found to be relevant in the Ethiopia accident which I believe it will be, watch the entire 737 MAX fleet be grounded in the coming weeks.

This of course presents difficult timing for those of us long $BA. A lot of us were holding $BA and $CAT until a Chinese trade deal was announced ... my plan was to sell into that trade news, now I’ve got to rethink whether to sell BA into THIS news!

Now BA has only dipped 2% ish since buying the contract. Yet the value of my call has tanked 35% leaving me to wonder how bad of a mistake I made.

Imo it is a beast. I honestly think it is super undervalued. Low P/E and solid earnings. How is it that companies like SNAP and NFLX are so overvauled where their potential relative to BA is minor.

I think that AeroSpace is everything and by definition has infinite growth. Commercial? Defense? The Boeing has it all.
On top of that they pay a fat divident.

The stock shot up more than 8%, its largest percentage gain since August 2009, to a high of $230.43, its highest intraday based on data going back more than 40 years. The dollar gain of nearly $17 was the best daily point rise on record. The shares have gained for four straight sessions, and tacked on nearly 10% over that period.

Boeing BA, +9.20% which has outperformed Wall Street estimates in the past five quarters, reported per-share earnings of $2.89, compared with FactSet consensus of $2.58 a share. It narrowly missed sales expectations, but that was offset by raising its 2017 EPS guidance.""

6phq69_BA,BA,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Boeing (BA) report tomorrow, thoughts???","The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of $2.38, six cents higher than the Wall Street consensus and a decrease of 17% YoY. Currently, the Estimize community is looking for sales of $23.01B which is a tick higher than the Street’s $22.97B.
Boeing looks to crush their EPS, which has become somewhat of a trend for BA. This is why investors are not too optimistic a big surprise will directly result in a large increase in stock price. On the revenue side, the past four quarters has shown a steady decrease which is due to their lagging commercial airplane sales. Boeing has seen increases in their global business service segment, which can be associated to Trump and his focus on the military and increasing the budget.

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of $2.21, three cents higher than the Wall Street consensus, however a decrease of 29% YoY. Currently, the Estimize community is looking at revenue of $6.45B, which is slightly more optimistic than the Street ($6.36B). Check out the Estimize website to see our prediction for Arrival Sales.  
Gilead has been underperforming in comparison to the broader market and the reason is not a mystery. Gilead’s revenue from their Hepatitis C drug has been falling, in 2016 they were down 22.5% YoY and accounted for 50% of their total product sales. However, the positive is that Gilead recently received FDA approval for their chronic Hepatitis C drug, Vosevi. This new drug will help them gain a larger portion of the Hep C market, with patients who did not respond to other drugs.

# Description
The Boeing Company is an aerospace firm with a commercial jet arm and a defense industry division. Sure there are other services on the side, but these are what count!

In fact over 70% of sales are from the commercial arm ($66bn v $30bn from defense) and over 60% of earnings from it ($5bn v $3bn from defence).



## Recent financials 

Over the last 5 years both sales and earnings have performed well. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $96bn | $91bn | $87bn | $82bn | $69bn|
|EPS | $7.44 | $7.38 | $5.96 | $5.11 | $5.33|

Though let's look at the two businesses, see the cause...

...clearly Commercial is doing well in terms of sales, and their backlog is beautiful, but it's not yet coming through in profits

|Commercial|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Backlog | $431bn | $440bn | $373bn |
|Revenue | $66bn | $60bn | $53bn |
|Operating Profit | $5bn | $6bn | $6bn |

and the Defense business is treading water.

## Competition
From their annual

> The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan.

and in Defense, where there are lots of rules to ensure that ""enemies"" can't sell kit to the US govt, but that does stop the Europeans selling to the US, and they do a pretty good job of it.

> we faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies.

So with all the trappings of being the gorilla, what does it add up to... great returns but rubbish margins. Even the ragbag of a business Airbus manages a higher margin. 

So what's going on? Are they winning business v the other A&D players by bidding too low? Is the heavily unionized workforce getting a larger share of the cashflow than at the competition?

## Cash / Debt?

Boeing Co has $1,750M of net debt. That is 0.3x it's latest operating profit. Which is rather low. Though given the way the aerospace business works with backlog, options on plane, etc. I wonder if this is a fair reflection of their liabilities.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $149.27 for Boeing Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target.

# Valuation

And despite the core operations not looking to be growing much, Wall Street's got them on the highest PE ratio of all the US and the international peers. Okay it's got the best dividend and is good at generating cashflow, but is the forecast growth rate realistic, after so many good years?

# Dividends
Boeing Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $4.34 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $4.18 per share. That is a 4% growth. The forecast dividend of $4.34 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.31. On top of this they have a $14 billon share repurchase plan.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -26%. Ouch. So the stock's treading water, even though earnings are under pressure.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ba/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

> Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year to date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish with year to date freight traffic down approximately 1%.

So there is a nice secular growth story here for Commercial. And at the Defense arm

> Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key programs and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years.

Were the charges that hit earnings in 2Q and caused the downgrades one off? From $7.44 a share in 2015 to $6.31 this year. With Wall Street expecting a bumper $9.64 in 2017. Well, if they can hit the Sept forecast of $2.63 a share in earnings and persuade us there are no more nasties coming in terms of charges, then yes. Perhaps the Wall Street optimism is justified.

So, a question to any long-term investor in $BA... are the one-offs really one of? Or do they have a habit of appearing regularly?

4uxir0_BA,BA,The Boeing Company ($BA) 2Q16 net loss of $0.37 per share,"
The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reports quarterly loss on charges. The company reported 2Q16 net loss of $0.37 per share, including a $3.23 per share impact. $BA said its 787 cost reclassification resulted in a charge of $1.33 per share while the 747 program generated a charge of $1.28 per share. The KC-46 Tanker program accounted for a charge of $0.62 per share.
It delivered 199 commercial airplanes in 2Q16. Commercial airplanes revenue in the quarter increased 3% to $17.5Bil on higher volume and price mix, the company said.

$BA cut its 2016 EPS outlook to $6.40 - 6.60 per share from its prior forecast of $8.45 - 8.65 per share to reflect the 787 R&D reclassification and the 747 and Tanker charges. $BA also reduced its outlook for operating margin from commercial airplanes to 4.5% - 5.0% from about 9%. The company maintained its 2016 revenue outlook of $93.0 - 95.0Bil.
During the call, $BA said that on the 747 program, the company decided to reduce future production expectation and revenue assumptions to account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market. Despite the air cargo market challenges, $BA is seeing 747 as a unique value creator for its customers over the long run.
