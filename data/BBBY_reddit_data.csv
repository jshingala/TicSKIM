12ye7he_BBBY,BBBY,"Earnings wave, Credit Suisse ($CSGN) outflows, Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY) bankruptcy‚Äîwhat's moving markets?","U.S. futures point lower as investors look ahead to a wave of massive corporate earnings this week. Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy.

**1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gear**

High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.

Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.

Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. ($META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel ($INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. ($MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. ($XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. ($MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company ($KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company ($LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.

Last week, JPMorgan ($JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic ""storm clouds"" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.

**2.** **Credit Suisse's 'alarming' results**

Credit Suisse ($CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG ($UBSG).

The bank called the outflows ""significant,"" adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.

It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.

The results, which analysts at KBW called ""alarming,"" set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.

""UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor,"" analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.

**3. NBCUniversal CEO to step down**

NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. ($CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.

In a statement, Shell said he had had an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.

""Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal,"" Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.

Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.

Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.

**4. Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy**

U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. ($BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.

The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.

But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath & Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.

Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.

The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath & Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.

**5. Oil slips amid broader economic fears**

Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.

Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.

By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.

Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.",2023-04-25,1,1

It ended up getting rejected at $1 as expected. There is potential for $GNPX to break its channel to the upside if volume continues to increase. In the event that it doesn't break it, the price action will fall back to the bottom of the channel. Here is the updated chart below.

I am adding $USAU to my watchlist for the week. I talked about this stock just as it was breaking out of the descending triangle that it was in. After breaking out, it has now come back all the way down to those same levels. I am expected a relief bounce here with a couple green candles for this week after a full week of pulling back. I am looking for $USAU to reclaim $4.50 and get close to $5. I assume it would get rejected here so remember to take profits when you see them.

If you‚Äôre short and you‚Äôre being a dick and ignoring the bull case altogether, you‚Äôre only hurting yourself and others, it may be time to consider exiting your position.

If you think people who held through the bankruptcy rumors AND held through the (now resolved) ABL default back in January are going to sell because of dilution and a reverse split, your huffing copium harder than Charlie Kelly huffs glue. 

IMO dilution is the only thing keeping this stock from exploding right now, and that could stop at any time. It may go on for much longer, but it may not.

11ri7ml_BBBY,BBBY,BBBY: best case scenario speculation,"This was supposed to be one post with worst case linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/comments/11ri00e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and best case. Was having some issues and I‚Äôm trying to break it up to see if that helps.

Yesterday, in the comments of another post, I commented a theory about how bbby dilution could lead to a short squeeze which, coupled with a turnaround, I think is the best case scenario. I will copy that below with some adjustments momentarily. I want to say first though that the point may just be to drive down the price low enough for long enough that the entire shares outstanding is DRS‚Äôd, which one would think surely ought to lead to wild upward price action. Granted, that goal becomes more challenging the longer the dilution was to occur.

On to my theory. There is a lot to unpack so bear with me. Remember, what‚Äôs below is mainly copied from a comment yesterday so some parts are obviously wrong as currently stated because we now know the holder is HBC.  Nonetheless, I think this is a good starting point for my best case scenario speculation. 

The main assumptions of my theory are as follows:

1: I think a malicious market maker would NOT want their victim stock on reg sho, because of the additional requirements around forced FTD closure. This would be especially true for stocks that are heavily bought and held by retail, because FTDs for such stocks are likely more difficult to resolve.

2: imo stocks achieve the 5 consecutive days below the FTD threshold to be removed from reg sho only when sell pressure (including real shorts, naked shorts) outweighs buy pressure for an extended period of time.

3: therefore, allowing the price to run for extended periods of time helps market makers have a stock removed from reg sho by shifting the balance in point 2 more in their favor. When the price is high, people are less likely to buy, more likely to short, and more likely to sell. Fomo would be an issue at first, but fomo is not infinite. If people just never sell, and only keep holding, or better yet keep buying, the temporary price running strategy can backfire which I think is what happened when gme sneezed. The removal of the buy button wasn‚Äôt about buying imo, it was about scaring people into selling so the stock could be removed from reg sho, which it was several days after the sneeze as shown in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1183kri/i_compiled_and_organized_18_years_of_reg_sho_data/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post.

4: I think the investor is diluting the stock in such a way that most of the shares they sell do not go toward resolving existing FTDs, and they are able to keep bbby on reg sho and keep the price low while doing so, forcing shorts to double down in an attempt to can kick FTDs by shorting again under $3, $2, $1.50 - just burning money. Imagine HAVING to short this stock at these levels, especially opposed to your previous option of letting the price run, covering some FTDs organically, and only then doubling down on your shorts for the remaining FTDs at the elevated price?

IF the investor could manage this strategic price suppression, the FTD total should, on average, rise for the duration of the dilution. Whenever the dilution goes away, there would be a Mount Everest sized pile of FTDs to cover and shorts would be absolutely fucked beyond belief. I think they are regardless of whether this theory is correct but that is not the point of this post.

So how is point 4 above even possible, especially without knocking the stock off of reg sho? I have at least one theory to explain this, but it is admittedly very speculative.

What if there are 2 mystery investors? We‚Äôll just call them A and B. Let‚Äôs assume that both investors have access to the lit exchanges through some third party.

Suppose investor A wants to buy, idk, 19.9% of bbby. Also, it is worth noting that as the stock is diluted that number of shares grows. 

Investor A puts in a buy order for a million shares at the bid. I have a feeling that no malicious market maker wants to naked short a million shares at the bid, so the order will likely sit on the books until the share price goes down and the ask moves towards the order‚Äôs limit price.

But, investor B is out there in the world! He‚Äôll sell a million shares at the bid because he paid less than market price for his shares by converting his preferred shares! He is making money by filling the order.

Investor A and Investor B can place and fill large buy orders at the bid and drive the price down without ever even officially working together. They know no one else is going to touch these orders, because it does not make financial sense for anyone else to do so.

In order for the market makers to accomplish that goal of temporarily raising the price so they can get bbby removed from reg sho, they need to be buying more shares at the ASK than investor B is selling at the BID. On large FTD due dates, you can see in the trading volume whoever owes all these FTDs (I think) trying and failing to do this, as the price swings wildly upward, and is immediately hammered back down

I hope this makes sense, and presents a plausible explanation of how dilution may be possible without knocking bbby off of reg sho

OK! Back to today‚Äôs post since you‚Äôre all caught up. I was super happy when I arrived at the above theory because I felt it made a ton of sense. But even then, something didn‚Äôt quite sit right with me. The best case, I think, is something like Icahn doing M/A with BBBY and spinning off BABY for RC. That is a very popular theory in the bbby sub that I did not come up with. If accurate, don‚Äôt RC and Icahn both want lots of common stock? So who is investor A and who is investor B? Are they both buying/converting preferred shares and selling to the other one? That would just seem weird

Then this morning, like a Pi day present, BBBY finally files something that confirms the identity of the holder of Preferred shares and the common/preferred warrants: a hedge fund

Let‚Äôs call them investor C! In the worst case for BBBY longs, investor C is a collection of savvy geniuses who saved their own skin. In the best case for BBBY longs, investor C is a bunch of idiots. In the best case scenario, in mid 2022 if everything had continued as it had been going, HBC was absolutely fucked, just like all the other shorts.

But then, I assume Ryan Cohen, the very investor giving them hell, offers them a way of escape. HBC gets to make a ton of money, close any FTDs that THEY had, and not get liquidated if/when shit hits the fan. RC and Icahn (could be just one of them at this point) buy up all the shares they need at a super cheap price. Retail gets a crazy discount. Dilution stops eventually, Shortsqueeze, epic turnaround.

This is not financial advice. Disclaimer: I have had similar theories many times, and have basically always been wrong at least to a degree.",2023-03-15,0,26
11ri00e_BBBY,BBBY,BBBY: worst case speculation,"This was originally going to be one post about best and worst case speculation, but I‚Äôm having trouble posting for some reason so I am going to break it up. This is not financial advice.

If anyone feels that my worst case scenario is not bad enough, and they can do better while still being realistic and accounting for all the info (mainly still being on reg sho), or feels that my take is based on some mistaken assumption(s), then please explain in the comments.

Worst case in my mind is HBC is trying to end this, they are still short, and want to either 
1: somehow still drive the company bankrupt longer term, or
2: perhaps get the stock delisted. 

Let‚Äôs start with 1. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me frankly. The whole structure of the convertible deal is such that HBC helps BBBY raise money, while also raising money themselves. The more money they help BBBY raise, the more money they raise themselves, at least if I understand the deal correctly. This is because for every preferred share they get they can convert it below market price, and sell all the resulting common stock for a profit. Add to that, BBBY seems to have a strong board that owns a lot of stock themselves, and I feel like option 1 can almost be thrown out entirely.

What about option 2? I looked into the delisting process [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/delisting-process-nasdaq-2015-11-13), and want to just quote a few things:
‚ÄúIf a company is in violation of the continued listing standards for a period of 30 consecutive days, the NASDAQ sends a ""deficiency notice."" The most common reasons for a deficiency notice are a share price that falls below $1.00 or a market cap that falls below the stated minimum (as low as $5 million if other requirements are satisfied).

Once a deficiency notice has been sent, the company has 90 days to comply with the continued listing standards, or 180 days if the violation was for a sub-$1.00 share price. In order to be compliant, the company's share price or market cap must rise above the minimum for at least 10 consecutive days in the 90-day (or 180-day) period.‚Äù

So to recap, if the violation is sub-$1.00 share price (most likely in our scenario) then we have 30 + 180 days or 7 months to regain compliance, which would reset the clock on delisting. All we have to do to regain compliance would be have a share price over $1.00 for 10 consecutive days during that time. Add to this - there is a movement to buy and DRS the whole company. If they drive the price this low for this long, they will fuck around and find out what happens if that movement succeeds. Personally, part of me hopes this is what is happening, it would be wild. But it also seems like a terrible idea for HBC, so this seems unlikely to me, just like option 1.

11rho2o_BBBY,BBBY,BBBY dilution - is another filing required?,"I have a post written about the 8-k filing this morning, but can‚Äôt post it for some reason. Idk if it is too long, or Reddit is still buggy or what, but I will keep trying. Short version of that post is I am still bullish. Thought I would post this in the meantime.

People have been saying for a while now in the bbby sub that if dilution was occurring with BBBY stock, then we would have gotten an sec filing explicitly stating that. One often cited rule is that once a threshold of 5% of the shares outstanding is diluted, then we have to have an 8-k.

I went looking for the relevant regulations to try and read what exactly they say for myself. The 5% of shares outstanding threshold that would trigger an 8-k filing comes from Item 3.02 in the sec‚Äôs regulations regarding form 8-k. The regulations are linked below. This item has the heading: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

[form 8-k regulations](https://www.sec.gov/files/form8-k.pdf)

As the heading implies, this rule only applies to unregistered sales of equity securities. What does that mean? Sales of equity where the equity itself is not registered with the sec. I did not find this clearly spelled out anywhere, but I did find some things to support this conclusion.

Linked below is an example of the type of filing in question. This is exactly the type of filing people are claiming we should expect from bbby if dilution were occurring, as indicated in Item 3.02 of the 8-k regulations.

[example file](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1003472/000129783306000002/form8kunregisteredsaleofequi.htm)

You can see in this example the following statement which supports the idea that this filing was only required because the securities were unregistered: ‚ÄúThe Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 30 days of the closing for the purposes of registering the resale of the shares of common stock (including shares into which the warrants are exercisable) issued in the private placement.‚Äù

So, to know whether or not we should truly be expecting a similar filing from bbby for any dilution that may be occurring, we just need to know whether or not the shares involved in the dilution are registered with the SEC. Turns out, they are already registered, meaning we will not be getting an 8-k even if there is dilution.

Find linked below the 424(b)(5) filing from 2/9, where the following statement explains how everything covered by the private offering is registered under the form S-3 (the sec form used to register securities) that was filed LAST AUGUST! If the statement does not seem conclusive enough, check out the table at the bottom of the document where the registration fees for all securities involved, including the common stock preferred shares convert into, are detailed in a nice clean table.

‚ÄúThis prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus are part of an automatic ‚Äúshelf‚Äù registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the SEC as a ‚Äúwell-known seasoned issuer‚Äù as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‚ÄúSecurities Act‚Äù), using a ‚Äúshelf‚Äù registration process.‚Äù

[bbby form 424b5](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16981/html)

Because the shares appear to be already registered, my understanding is that if dilution is occurring we will find out the new number of shares outstanding in the next quarterly report, and we will have no way to prove or disprove dilution until then.

Basically all the other claims about a required sec filing that I have seen are also based on the (apparently) mistaken assumption that the shares are not already registered.

If I am mistaken or have misunderstood, please explain in the comments what is wrong with this argument.",2023-03-15,0,17

‚ÄúIn the event a Bankruptcy Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, the Company shall be required to redeem, in cash, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price based on a required premium, as described in this prospectus supplement.‚Äù

What is a bankruptcy triggering event? There are several defined in the document. This is the one that, IMO, 100% proves dilution is happening:
‚Äú(viii) ¬†¬†¬†¬†the commencement by the Company or any Subsidiary of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law‚Ä¶‚Äù

This document is from February 6. What happened on February 10? 
From the WSJ (idk how to find Canadian company filings to verify this from a primary source):
‚ÄúBed Bath & Beyond Inc.‚Äôs Canadian division will shut down its stores under court protection after the company received an unusual lifeline earlier this week to save its U.S. operations from bankruptcy. The troubled home-goods retailer on Friday filed its Canadian division for protection under the Companies‚Äô Creditors Arrangement Act, Canada‚Äôs rough equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.‚Äù

BBBY Canada closing = Bankruptcy triggering event = required preferred share conversion

# Hello Reddit,

# 

# 

&#x200B;

# I'm u/anonfthehfs and I am presenting this DD with a heavy heart because I just wrapped my head around what just happened.

&#x200B;

# 

# 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So just to clarify what that means in BBBY situation:**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(I've been talking with Shawn at DilutionTracker who understands this stuff way better than me, so it's not just me talking out of my ass)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Hudson Bay did this:**   (I'm simplifying this because I know this is really hard for a lot of people to read the legalese and understand these terms so I'm trying to bridge the knowledge gap.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Hudson Bay either goes to BBBY or BBBY approaches Hudson because they are about to go bankrupt.  They work out a deal to ""save"" BBBY but it comes at a huge price which I'll explain.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Main point being Hudson Bay:   Committed to buy $220m preferred shares**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Why?**   Preferred Shares were given to them at a discounted rate of 5% which means they have built in profit on ever single one converted.  Hudson Bay literally doesn't care what price these BBBY shares get converted at because they already have profits built in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**When Hudson Converts these, the shares outstanding grows diluting the BBBY shareholders and shorts are able to find locates on FTDs.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Added kick in the nuts is there is INCENTIVE  to lower the price, the more shares they get until it gets to the minimum 0.716 conversion price which is the ""floor"".)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Example from Shawn:   "":If there was still $200m dollars of convertible preferred left and the lowest daily VWAP price in the last 10 days was $2, they can convert into $200m/($2\*0.92)= 108m shares. If the lowest daily VWAP price in the last 10 days was $1, then they get $200m/($1\*0.92)= 217m shares.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/swc61g96gaha1.gif

&#x200B;

# This means the lower the price, the more shares they get to convert

# 

In simple terms, Hudson gets an 8% discount conversion price and the 92% formula ensures they always make money.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Hudson essentially will see how much they can dump onto the market before hitting the floor price of 0.716 cents.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From Shawn at DilutionTracker:  ""If there's still liquidity in the stock after the full $220m is converted, Hudson Bay has the option to buy up to $800m.  If they feel like, or if the BBBY requests them to buy more, as long as stock hasn't gone below $0.7 yet which is the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Warrants is to purchase more preferred shares at a 5% discount. Those preferred shares are the same as the convertibles at 2.37 that also contains variable conversion price.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Price Protection on Feb Warrants Series A Convertible Preferred $2.25:***

Prospective investors that purchase 75,000,000 or more of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock Warrants will also receive a pro rata interest in 84,216 Preferred Stock Warrants to purchase up to 84,216 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock Warrants are immediately exercisable at any time at the option of the holder for a pro rata interest in the total Preferred Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $9,500 per share and will expire one year from the issuance date.

***Price Protection :  Feb Warrants $6.15:***

&#x200B;

If the holder of a Common Stock Warrant also holds Preferred Stock Warrants, then the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Common Stock Warrant held by such holder shall automatically increase on each exercise date of the Preferred Stock Warrant, on a share by share basis, by 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued to the holder in each exercise of the holderÔøΩs Preferred Stock Warrant at the Alternate Conversion Price

***February 2023 Series A Convertible Preferred $2.37 :***

Price Protection:  At the option of the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, at any time and from time to time, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted into Conversion Shares at a conversion price at the lower of (i) the applicable conversion price in effect on the applicable conversion date and (ii) the greater of (x) 0.7160 and (y) 92% of the lowest volume-weight average price of the Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day a conversion notice is delivered (the ÔøΩAlternate Conversion PriceÔøΩ).

\-----------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lastly the 6.15 warrants are their hedge in case it goes above $6.15 -  They can use the Price Protections I just listed to make sure they are protected.

https://i.redd.it/ku0ll8h9gaha1.gif

# 

# 

# Remember that 90 Day Period $BBBY said they won't issue out more shares?  There is a reason for it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**These Hedge Funds who are funding this deal wanted assurances that $BBBY wouldn't issue out their ATM and under cut them for funding.    So the 90 period basically makes sure that these Funds like Hudson Bay will do their Conversions with no competition from the company undercutting them to raise money.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**That means most likely the conversions will happen over the next 90 days from the start of the filing.**

# Until the bottom drops out and they see how many shares are Outstanding after all these Dilution.

&#x200B;

Dr. Burry was correct about this.   Preferred Convertibles are not good......

# 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:  Hudson Bay just bent over $BBBY and had their way with them.  BBBY basically had no other offers for financing and made this deal this will keep them alive temporarily but just diluted the hell out of their own shareholders.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A company is about to bankrupt, strange price action, this gives me a d√©j√† vu feeling, I wonder if this is another GME. So I checked the short interest, it‚Äôs 33.72% on December 30th, although not as high as the GME one, but still remarkably high, are traders buying it for a short squeeze? The retail traders battling Wall Street scenario is happening again?

[Jake Freeman, the 20 year old nephew of a hedge fund manager who made over $80 million on a BBBU play just did an news interview. You can find an article with highlights here](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/a-college-student-made-a-110-million-profit-on-bed-bath-beyond-stock-in-under-a-month-jake-freeman-shed-light-on-his-background-his-massive-bet-and-the-retail-backlash-to-it-in-a-twitter-q-a/ar-AA11zlV6?ocid=entnewsntp&cvid=d1c5697254b042f09ef700d1e9006703) and the full audio of the interview in [this twitter link here.](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YqJDqgRmjExV?s=20) Of particular note, he states that he is ""taken aback"" by the "" visceral responses and strongly opinionated responses from the Reddit community."" The article further states that ""Freeman hinted that he didn't make an activist play at Bed Bath & Beyond because Ryan Cohen, the activist investor and GameStop chairman, was already pushing for changes at the company."" To which freeman stated ""There is a phrase: Too many cooks in the kitchen.""

To which I say, obviously, Mr. Freeman just got lucky on making a large investment with his ""investor's""  (obviously his uncle's) money and had utterly no idea what he was actually doing for if he truly believed that Cohen was ""pushing for changes at the company"", why would he have bailed before Cohen actually implemented those changes? The answer is of course, that i'm sure Freeman realized that making $85 million off of someone else's money is not half bad when your 20 years old and in college. Despite Freeman's inane commentary, there is a good lesson to be learned here. If your wild YOLO of a play finally does pay out and you see yourself with a nice pile of gains SELL!

There are some very interesting date coincidences when comparing price and naked short interest.

Notice that boom on 8/2 coincides with the subsequent naked short volume the very next day. Hedgies want to grab BBBY by the balls and control the price, but do they. . .

Ah the squeeze days - from 8/12 to 8/18 BBBY went parabolic. Hedgies had lost control they were still heavily short, the possibility of hedge funds actually going bankrupt from this was very real. Something drastic needed to happen and it did...

https://preview.redd.it/mvsk8uct2ol91.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=d177d6eaacba4af8ebbedae4d095dce376b578f0

Wild August for sure, we're literally back where we started but the conditions are very different. There's no fear of bankruptcy, trading volume is higher than it was in early August and most importantly there are no naked shorts controlling the price.  Also, chart wise it's looking bullish:

wto7b8_BBBY,BBBY,"I took a big loss trying to day trade BBBY, looking into selling CC's to recoup losses?","Stupidly enough, I tried day trading BBBY and was doing well taking profits every 10 minutes with an in-and-out strategy ($2K profits). I got comfortable and did not use stop losses or any risk management and long story short, I ended up losing 50% of my capital with a $17K realized loss. Absolutely devasted as I experienced similar losses in 2 other instances. 

I have decided to recoup these losses using the covered calls. I know GME has always had a high premium and looking to sell weekly ATM CC's for maximum premium.  I have ~$31K capital available for this. I previously held GME but at a high average of $47 so it was difficult selling CC's due to my average and rode the downturn the market took with it. I still made ~$2.5K in premiums by selling CC's when I took the chance and recently sold at $47 when it spiked. This sucks because of all those months of sitting on those losses with GME and finally exiting with a net profit only to lose half of it on BBBY the very next day.

My strategy: Monitor prices this week as it might be a bit bearish and buy ~900 shares between the $33 to $35 price if it falls that much. Sell 9 ITM call contracts at my average buy-in price. I looked up the premiums and the $35 8/26 are going for around $3.2 to $3.5.

Scenario: 900 shares at $35 average. Sell 9 weekly contracts at $35 strike for $3.4 each and gain $3K in premiums. If assigned, I make $3K for the week and if it goes a bit below the $35 price, my average would be $31.67 now. I would have to pull this off 5 times to make back my losses which is technically possible but I know there are way too many factors that could change everything so I want to take this week by week and reassess. 

I can't wheel because my account does not allow selling puts so I can only do CC's. The potential downsides to this are if GME rips to $40+, I would miss out on those gains (willing to live with this one) or GME somehow completely tanks to below $25 and I am now bag holding it again (very unlikely for this week but anything is possible). GME earnings are also around the corner on September 7th so I would probably not want to hold during that week.

I have looked into safer options in SPY/QQQ but the premiums aren't high enough for the capital that is required (can't even do this for SPY). 

I will not be trading/scalping options which are extremely tempting to me but the risk involved is too much. I got caught up doing calculations if I buy x amount of contracts and the price moves this much, I could recoup all my losses in one go but I don't have the experience nor the bravado to attempt that. I have a $550 account where I have started playing with 0 DTEs but not with my main account. 

Should I be considering something for this strategy that I may have overlooked? GME has been a premium heaven over the last 1.5 years where people have a negative cost basis by just selling CC's. Obviously, there is always risk involved which is why I want to stick to weeklies for this with aggressive ITM strikes to get assigned. 

Any other viable options to best use my capital to recoup losses in a safer way? I am not looking to revenge trade nor trying to make back everything in one go. The goal is to make small gains and compound profits till that $17K goal is hit.",2022-08-21,0,28

I want to take a break from trading options because I don't think I can consistently make money from this yet. I'd like to start selling covered calls instead. I noticed that currently if I were to buy 100 shares of BBBY and sell a deep itm cc 2 weeks out I would be able to make about 125 dollars as long as the contract stays itm.

wtcai6_BBBY,BBBY,BBBY trading volume something smells funny‚Ä¶,"BBBY newly assigned shares & MM delta hedging.

So for the past seven weeks I‚Äôve had a 96.3% success rate selling CSP‚Äôs. This week however all of my positions got assigned. This is obviously a market wide downward sift  however it has me thinking about how ‚Äúmarket forces‚Äù effected the price and the broader impact. BBBY in particular had excessive volume this week. Consider the following metrics. 

Total shares outstanding 79,960,000
Public Float                        68,210,000
Institutional ownership     71,231,759 (89.41%) (fintel 8/19)
Short interest                    (38,968,885) (41.86%) (fintel 8/19)

Weekly volume.             1,130,000,000 (14.1x shares outstanding) 


Assuming ever single short covered this week and reloaded to re-short again on Friday 8/19.    How are my trades and assignments accounted for with respect to price discovery? I.e. I had CSP‚Äôs at 18 & 14, I‚Äôve agreed to purchase actual shares at 18 & 14; meanwhile there was potentially 14 times that many synthetic shares being solicited for a lessor value.

Q1) how do I determine how many days the shorts have to cover after this week?

Q2) how could naked shorting not be taking place? 

Q3) is there a way to view the volume and value of CSP‚Äôs that were assigned on Friday? When those shares are cleared wouldn‚Äôt that cause a squeeze considering the sacristy of actual shares available? 

Q4) do institutional owners generally hold certificates or direct register their shares?

wsf1sw_WBD,WBD,"Down on BBBY? WBD Game of Thrones rally coming - Multiversus, Black Adam, HBO Max, The Sandman","Last time ill post this as I'm confident the rally is starting. I'm sorry for everyone who lost betting on Cohen, but you can trust that WBD has real REAL century old (1923) value in their IP. This stock is oversold and is now rallying while others are down today, The breakout is clear if you map out the 2 major resistances (Green and Red Line on my Chart).

This company deserves so bad to be squeezed, coming down from 75 dollars a share and now being held down for an extended time by the shorts, Let's give them a Super Hero sized F U for our beloved DC Comic Heroes.

Catalyst - Game Of Thrones House of Dragons will add the largest number of subs to HBO Max ever, Multiversus just released the official Season 1 to the hit WBD property game that broke 10 million downloads in 3 weeks, and The Sandman proves WBD has the best content on any platform (Released on Netflix for cash), Black Adam with The Rock should pull 500m plus at the box office in October.

When it comes to their debt, they paid off more than 10% of it in 1 quarter, and after the earnings call the debt got completely baked into the price, so any Debt paid can be added as pure value to the stock, the only way is up from here.

wscrr3_BBBY,BBBY,Ryan Cohen Sold His Entire BBBY Shares and Options: Do you think it was a pump and dump?,"Meme stock influencer Ryan Cohen is sending Bed Bath & Beyond stock plummeting.

Shares of the badly struggling retailer cratered 45% in pre-market trading on Friday as it was disclosed late Thursday Cohen's RC Ventures sold his entire position in Bed Bath & Beyond. Cohen, who is also the chairman of GameStop, had about an 11.8% stake in the company.

Cohen's exit caps off an otherwise insane week of trading for a retailer not too far away from entering a grave alongside Sears, Kmart, Borders, and Circuit City.

Bed Bath & Beyond stock skyrocketed by nearly 70% in intraday trading on Tuesday as a result of a massive short squeeze. BBBY stock finished that session up 29% in a volatile day. From Tuesday's close to prior to Cohen's disclosure after Thursday's session, shares had gained another 17%.

Cohen initially disclosed a 9.8% stake in the company in March, and the recent resurgence of BBBY stock involved the meme community once again rallying together to counter institutional forces that hold opposing views on the stock and the underlying business.

On Monday, Yahoo Finance reported on signs of financial stress at Bed Bath & Beyond locations in New York ‚Äî and received colorful feedback from BBBY fans. On Tuesday, B Riley slashed its rating to Sell on Bed Bath & Beyond. Analysts at UBS and Wedbush also reiterated their sell ratings on the stock this week.

But with Cohen now out of the picture, the market may turn back to focusing on Bed Bath & Beyond's bleak near-term outlook.

And, as we've previously reported, it's brutal.

After a failed push in 2021 and most of 2022 into stocking stores with private label goods no one had heard of while also closing stores and firing workers, Bed Bath & Beyond ended its most recent quarter with a little more than $100 million in cash, tanking sales, weak store traffic, and a badly damaged brand.

There is currently an interim CEO running the business, which came about after the booting of former top Target exec Mark Tritton, and some observers are wondering whether vendors will continue to ship all of the merchandise that Bed Bath & Beyond needs for the holiday season amid the retailer's severely weakened financial state.

wsih6u_BBBY,BBBY,Ryan Cohen selling BBBY like that doesn't make much sense. Some thoughts.,"RC is a Billionaire. It makes no sense he would sell his position for a $68M profit.

They said RC and BBBY reached an agreement yesterday, we don‚Äôt know what that is yet but it will be announced before the end of Aug.

RC has had a strong relationship with Apes for a long time now. $68M also not worth trashing your rep and image and ego and fan club for. It's not even a profit, it's a hundred million loss with the GME impact taken into account (which he is well aware of). Throw in his entire brand, and obsessive personal identity towards the little guy, and there's no way he would do this without something guaranteed to counterbalance and knock it out of the park.

Selling his stake was likely part of that agreement. Liquidity for BBBY was specifically mentioned and this fits, if they get his Insider Stake. What RC gets in return, we don‚Äôt know yet. We can speculate, Buy Buy Baby is the only asset of value that comes to mind.

Big announcement incoming boys and girls, by the end of the month if not tomorrow AM.

Something way, way bigger than a little profit on stock trade. Think Bigger!

I choose to trust RC for now.

Position: 614 at $4.78, haven't sold anything.

Stop being little bitches. Most of you bought because of a short squeeze anyway, not RC. And the squeeze is still in play.

**Edit**: not $19M but $68M as some of you have pointed out. My opinion stands. He had multiple opportunities to sell for more than that in the past 5 months and he didn't.

As for calling some of you little bitches, yes you are. And stop playing risky stocks with money you can't afford to lose.

**Edit2:**  What a lot of people aren‚Äôt realizing is that RC‚Äôs GME stake is worth 1.5B. His original investment in the company was <100M. Apes helped him make over 1B on that investment and are a huge percentage of the companies shareholders. Why would he risk hurting a 1.5B investment to make 68M. GME going down even 12% would be worse for him than BBBY going to 0. Lots of people aren‚Äôt getting this, it‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs just a good guy, it‚Äôs that financially, it‚Äôs in his best interest for us to support him. ",2022-08-19,2067,577

We thought that today's story about Ryan Cohen filing to dump his entire stake in Bed Bath & Beyond after sparking a massive gamma squeeze using deep OTM call options would be the most absurd meme-related story of the day. Boy, were we wrong.

In a late Wednesday article published on the FT which at first (and second, and third) read comes across as a cross between absurdist satire and a PR puff piece, we read the day's feel-good ""riches to riches"" story in which a 20-year-old university student, Jake Freeman, who is an applied mathematics and economics major at the University of Southern California, managed to accumulate 6.2% of the entire outstanding stock of Bed Bath & Beyond at under $5.50 share (did we mention he is a 20-year-old university student) amounting to $27 million, which he announced in an activist 13-G letter to BBBY Management on July 21, 2022, and less than a month later sold out of his entire stake - thanks to the insane gamma squeeze in the stock - not through some prime broker but through his TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers accounts, making $110 million in the process!",2022-08-18,0,10

Many memestocks have made their way on /r/wallstreetbets radar over the years.  Each made its way at different times and came with some great memes, some big wins, some mind-boggling losses, and some great memories, and each one brought on many new members to our community and to retail trading.

I want to take this opportunity to reflect back during Jan. 2021 from behind the scenes.  As we were just about to hit another milestone of 2 million subscribers.  GME popped on our radar seemingly out of nowhere and very quickly gain a lot of traction similarly to $BBBY.

/r/wallstreetbets was a bigger story than covid. Every major publication and media outlet in the world rushed to make some sense of what was going on, all requested interviews with us and what I noticed was happening, each was not looking to report the news but every journalist had their own version of a story and was only looking for us to go on record on many things that were just made up and just not true. With the amount of media coverage 7 million new members flooded into /r/wallstreetbets, the ethos of our community became extremely muddied as many outside our community came in to speak for us as the media rushed to get their version of the story out.

I think it is exciting and amazing to see so many new members but let's not forget that a majority of members are new so take what is said with a grain of salt and do your own research.  Not everything is a short squeeze, not everything is a cryptic message.

/r/wallstreetbets first and foremost is about the come up and getting that bag.  The stories about what some people are willing to risk to get the bag and stories about their success or failure are what make this place amazing and fun.  It's your money and your own responsibility for how you choose to use it.  Get in, get out, move on and repeat the process.

Ty Have Fun.

I even increased my position on BBBY today to 20k. And i plan on sleeping like a baby.

How can i be so stress free you might ask? Don't I own 14 contracts all expiring Friday from every price between $15 & $25? Aren't I worried at all that i might go broke and have to go back to working the dick sucking station under the bridge for trading money?

Not a chance and there are 3 reasons i know why this not only isn't the case, but we will be mooning from today until friday:

# Reason #1: Ryan Cohen's News Today Was Actually Good

I know if you're reading this, you've already seen the important posts on this subject, but lets summarize it just in case some of you are Helen Keller level deaf, dumb, and regarded:

* **Ryan Cohen DID NOT sell his shares**. He filed a 144 form (yes it's verified and real) saying he was allowed to within the next 90 days. You'd have to be an idiot to not make the same move given the squeeze potential that is coming up.
* **Ryan Cohen WONT be selling his shares soon**. According to the Short-Swing Profit rule since Ryan bought his shares less than 6 months ago (he bought them 4 months ago), any profit he made off selling them would be given to BBBY and what self respecting billionaire spends 4 months of his life pumping a company to sell it for no gains? (Besides Jim Cramer if he had $999,998,452.10 more dollars after following his own financial advice)

So don't worry - the market is not about to be flooded with 10% of the company's stock. I'd like you also to consider the following though - that he would have to be a fucking idiot to sell now:

* **Why the fuck would he sell now when he just announced earlier this week that he's long?** The man already swung prices way higher in march when he announced he owned 10% and prices jumped above $30. Selling now when there are a literal army of apes trying to pump his company's stock when it's still lower than his initial pump with the company would be idiotic.
* **If Cohen tried to rug-pull the apes over BBBY, what do you think that would do to his other ape centric companies?** The man is Chairman of GME, the original ape stock. I don't pretend he has any love for any of us (he's a billionaire after all - the only thing he gives a fuck about is his net worth) but think about what betraying the apes would do to his bottom line? Who do you think owns GME stock? Do you think they'd keep holding their shares in a company after the Chairman made crystal clear they're trying to rob all apes blind? Possibly, we are pretty fucking stupid after all. BUT the real questions is this: do you think he would risk a significant dent to his $12b GME's market cap just for the sake of netting what CNBC reported would be a $60 million gain (which again HE CANT EVEN TAKE)?

So no, he did not sell his shares, wont be selling his shares, and it would be absolutely against his interest to sell his shares anytime soon -again i'm not a Ryan Cohen stan, but **look at these facts about what he's doing and use them as your own personal guide.**

# Reason #2: BBBY Said Themselves They Aren't Finished

You heard it right folks [Bed Bath and Beyond announced they've been working hand in hand with RC to obtain funding](https://www.webull.com/news/52523835). They've been at it for weeks (i.e. the same time RC announced he still owned his OTM calls) and if they're saying this now it can only mean one thing:

**Bed Bath And Beyond are going to announce soon that they've been secured additional funding.**

Sure call it speculation but just think about the timing of all this and the comments RC has been making while he's been working to help get them funding. Every nay sayer out there shitting on BBBY over the fact they are majorly in debt will have that excuse taken away. The dramatic stock price increase and retail enthusiasm may be the leading cause for them securing this funding too (so stay fucking hyped). Once the risk of the company going under is removed - what's left to keep the stock from taking off to at least last year's prices?

# Reason #3: The Inverse Cramer Principle

I'm not going to lie folks, when the dip dapped today down to $18 i was pretty worried. I still thought the Ryan Cohen stuff was real news, and i hadn't heard about BBBY's press release, but then i was visited by the Angel of Good News Future:

The man has been going off the wall spreading fake news and picking fights with us. US. The fucking apes that took a trash video game company from $2 to $480 all because we hated the hedge funds so much. And he gave us something to focus our hate on, so now it's time we inverse him so hard his dick falls off and he finally turns into his wife (who already kinda looks like him just with a wig on).

I honestly thought i was pretty tapped on how much more money i was going to put into this. I wanted to just ride the wave a bit longer, then retire to a bungalow in the Aruba with a jar of lube and a couple of watermelons but no longer. **I'm taking him down.** I'm taking out loans. I'm exercising my call options. I'm putting up signs around town recruiting new apes.

I thought this movement needed a Deep Fucking Value to make it go but i realize now i don't care - **All I need is someone I hate enough to keep investing money and I WILL NOT be defeated by this man who has guided a generation of investors into poverty.**

# TL;DR

BBBY is fine, RC hasn't sold, it seems like BBBY is going to have some extremely big news to come, and Cramer has given us something to rally around.

I'm going in harder again first thing in the morning with another 10k. I'm exercising my call options to really start squeezing them. You all should consider the same.

I'm lowering my target - **IF IT HITS 50 BY THE END OF THE WEEK I WILL BE PIERCING MY NIPPLES FOR THIS SUBS PLEASURES**

&#x200B;

So, someone spends over a million dollars on puts right before a very, very damaging headline comes out and gets copy-pasted everywhere before being ""corrected""?  Notice the time on the article has also been changed to 4:08pm EST - after the market closed.  Huh, is there a name for this kind of thing? There is!  It's called a ***Short and Distort.*** What is a Short and Distort?  Let's read the Wikipedia Definition:

""**Short and distort**"" is a type of [securities fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud) in which investors [short sell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_selling) a [stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) and then spread negative rumors about the company in an attempt to drive down stock prices.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-3)

It is often performed as a form of [naked short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) in which stock is sold without being borrowed and without any intent to borrow.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-5) Once the stock price has declined, the investor uses the proceeds of the initial sale to buy a larger number of the company's shares than sold originally. Some of the newly purchased stock is used to fulfill the short-selling contract; the remaining shares are then offered for sale, which causes an additional decline in the company's share price.

During the takeover of [The Bear Stearns Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_Stearns_Companies) by [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Morgan_Chase) in March 2008, reports swirled that short sellers were spreading rumors to drive down Bear Stearns' share price.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-6) [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)) [Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_United_States) [Christopher Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dodd) felt this was more than [rumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumor) and said, ""This is about [collusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion).""[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-7) Chase was victimized by a similar ""short and distort"" scheme six years earlier when rumors arose about its purported relationship with [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-8)

In a December 2006 interview from [TheStreet.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheStreet.com)'s ""Wall Street Confidential"" webcast, [Jim Cramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors about companies to the media and trading desks to drive a stock down: "" ...it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.""[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-9) Cramer said this practice, although illegal, is easy to do ""because the SEC doesn't understand it.""[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-10)

Cramer said one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread negative rumors to reporters he described as ""the Pisanis of the world"" in reference to CNBC's [Bob Pisani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pisani). ""You have to use these guys,"" said Cramer. He also discussed getting ""the bozo reporter from The Wall Street Journal"" to publish a negative article.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort#cite_note-11)

Now, is a Short and Distort illegal?  Well, let's check with the SEC:

**Short-and-distort schemes violate federal and state law**

The so-called short-and-distort scheme may violate the Securities Exchange Act anti-fraud provisions, as well as SEC Rule 10b-5, just like the better known antithetical ""pump-and-dump"" scheme. It checks all the boxes: (1) misrepresentation to the market (through articles, blogs and social media); (2) materiality (often including false statements about a company's financial condition or viability); (3) an intent to deceive (manipulating the market to create downward pressure on the share price to make a profit); and (4) connection to the purchase or sale of securities (initiating a selloff of securities to allow the short seller turned analyst to cover their short position). Likewise, this scheme may violate state securities and consumer protection statutes and common law.

Huh, guess it is!  You, know, it's kind of weird that Cramer's name came up in the Wikipedia definition.  I wonder if he's ever said anything on camera about this specific kind of crime or committing it?

[Oopsie!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Gg92YjOI)

Well, that's awkward.  But at least Cramer hasn't been talking bad about BBBY or acting crazy about that particular stock lately.

[Totally normal.](https://preview.redd.it/c98u4jnc2di91.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255e3eb8c268e24fbf2ffa2e5097af2d079b2d9)

Man, what a WILD bunch of coincidences that just happened today with BBBY!!  I can't believe it!  Oh, and there's one more little question I've been wondering about.

HOW THE FUCK DID SEEKING ALPHA GET THE GODDAMNED FORM 144 BEFORE IT WAS SEARCHABLE ON EDGAR!?!!?  Also, speaking of that Form 144, two were filed today.  Check this out:

I'll let you all come to your own conclusions about how a form that was emailed to the SEC appeared early on a website in a short and distort attack with different spacing and capitalization.

When the markets opened, $BBBY had 300K shares available for anyone desperate enough to short this. I'm sure there's a Melvin Capital 2.0 who's looking to blow up his fund and career. You've been warned. Apes are coming for you, and your stupid little fund is going through a tsunami of redemptions. Then you'll get to deal with a divorce, fire sale of your Aspen home, and eventually end up as a fry cook next to yours truly. End of day, [there's only 100K shares left to short](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/BBBY), and if you can manage to send an electrical signal between the lone crease in your brain, you'll deduce that Melvin 2.0 took up 200K shares today.

What else happened? Some whale decided to use his giant fuckin dong as a wrecking ball and dumped his entire holding of $BBBY dropping the price from \~$27 down to \~$20. That's right, [Freeman Capital Holdings dumped a position worth \~6% of $BBBY](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16351/html). And to top it off, I might have caught a glimpse of the fuck nugget with the $27K loan suffer a heart attack.

I would just like to share my thoughts on what happened today.

This morning we find out according to BBBY‚Äôs SEC 8K 

On August 17, 2022, in response to certain media inquiries, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) made the following statement:

‚ÄúWe were pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with RC Ventures in March and are committed to maximizing value for all shareholders. We are continuing to execute on our priorities to enhance liquidity, make strategic changes and improve operations to win back customers, and drive cost efficiencies; all to restore our company to its heritage as the best destination for the home, for all stakeholders. Specifically, we have been working expeditiously over the past several weeks with external financial advisors and lenders on strengthening our balance sheet, and the Company will provide more information in an update at the end of this month‚Äù

At the end of the day we find out RC exited his position in BBBY on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

All of you are thinking the same thing ‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt make any sense, right?

The company made a statement saying they would maximize value for all shareholders and they were in agreement. So why would they say that AFTER he dumped his shares.

He clearly believes Bye Bye Baby is worth ‚Äúseveral billion dollars‚Äù

He‚Äôs already placed three people on the board

The company also released an announcement at the end of the day that they hired a law firm to address an asset backed lending opportunity.

My guess is Cohen is funding an acquisition of Bye Bye Baby. 

I don‚Äôt think that Cohen would ruin his reputation over a rug pull. I think there is something here the markets are missing.

Don‚Äôt forget the reason why we invested in the first place

‚ÄúGiven that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company‚Äôs entire market capitalization today. Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other ecommerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.
In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABY‚Äôs high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers.‚Äù

wlz9fv_BBBY,BBBY,"#BBBY Gang, who of you continue to hold the line?","This week was crazy, we had many ups and downs, but the thesis stays intact. BBBY has many problems - cash burn, mismanagement of inventories, inneficient marketing strategy, underdeveloped online selling channels etc. However, it is no wonder that Ryan Cohen acquired a large stake at prices way higher than today's. The company definitely has untapped potential and could prove to be a succes story in the long-term. They have physical assets that are valued at billions of dollars,  nationwide brand recognition and most importantly they have a separate brand(business) that  they own  that by itself could be worth more than the whole company.  ""Buy Baby"" by itself generated more than 1 billion in sales, with 50 percent of sales generated online. The high short interest and the meme investing craze started by GME  is just the cherry on top. 

Having said that, I am well aware of the fact that gains might not come very soon and I am prepared to handle the volatility. A near term potential catalyst is the expected update at the end of August from the management about the company's current condition and the steps that have been taken for its restructuring. Nevertheless, as a European guy I am seeing a lot of retail investors from Europe having an interest in BBBY and I can assure you that a lot of us are ready to diamond hand our shares alongside our bros across the ocean.

PS: Investing in a business like BBBY that is struggling to say the least is extremely risky and is not recommended for people who have moderate to low risk tolerance. Invest at your own risk.

wkzbtm_BBBY,BBBY,"Jim Cramer says ""Don‚Äôt bet against short sellers in this market."" Do you think this BBBY short squeeze has some way to go?"," CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer on Tuesday warned investors to avoid buying money-losing stocks in a bet against short sellers.

The market went in favor of short-sellers on Tuesday after the major indices fell. The market teetered earlier in the day as it digested disappointing financial reports from companies and prepared for key inflation numbers later this week.

‚ÄúIn a market that‚Äôs presenting you with ample opportunities to lose money, I can‚Äôt endorse buying these money-losing stocks in the hope of engineering a short squeeze. Sooner or later, you end up with a day like today where that tactic just blows up in your face,‚Äù the ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host said.

Here are the stocks Cramer referred to:

* Bed Bath & Beyond
* Upstart
* AMC
* Beyond Meat
* Wayfair
* GameStop

More investors appear to be trying their luck with short-selling. The GS Most Short Index, which measures stocks that investors are shorting, or betting against, rose more than 18% over the last five days. It‚Äôs currently at its highest level since last January, when the meme stock craze was at its peak.

Cramer warned investors that this action is making money-losing stocks look deceptively attractive as long-term plays.

‚ÄúWhen good things happen to bad stocks, I get nervous. We‚Äôve seen a lot of low quality stocks rallying purely because too many hedge funds shorted them at the same time and those shorts ended up getting squeezed,‚Äù he said.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjdghe/bbby_before_you_regards_get_all_paper_handsy/)

If you didn‚Äôt know this already, BBBY Interim CEO Sue Gove has promised its shareholders a business update by the end of August. This promise was given at the July 14th shareholder meeting and was mentioned in more recent news as well. The speculation that we all have is that they will announce 1 of 3 options. This information comes directly from Ryan Cohen‚Äôs letter to BBBY, and also the shareholder meeting where they discussed the future of buy buy Baby and what they planned to do with it in August.

1. buy buy Baby full or partial sale 
2. buy buy Baby spin-off
3. buy buy Baby asset backed loan

Any of these announcements will add deep value to the company. We need to have diamond hands until this update is released and maybe a few weeks after the update so that these soulless shorts can have infinite losses and send this share price to the triple digits. Making tons of millionaires. LFG to the moon. ???

wk9oca_DE,DE,BBBY- The Do-Or-Die Moment for Short Sellers on 8/8 and 8/9 (DD),"I had been working on some DD prior to the initialization of the squeeze, but didn‚Äôt finish it in time, and there‚Äôs a lot of good DD out there already. I‚Äôm going to focus on what‚Äôs happening right now (8/9, BBBY down \~20% and what it means).

**TL:DR;** $BBBY has a lot of underwater short interest that is actively working against a squeeze. Today was a do-or-die moment.

**Positions:** 11K shares at about $7. Took profits along the way, but I‚Äôm holding what I have left to see what happens.

## Shares, Ownership & Short Interest

BBBY has been buying back shares for the last few years (terrible capital allocation imo, but that‚Äôs water under the bridge) and is now down to **79M shares outstanding from 186M in 2015:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/olsk42b65qg91.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9337fa823a6d3a0c2661bda05316a4a6f238b5

Currently, institutions and strategic entities are long **84M shares** out of **79M outstanding** \- yes, they are long more than 100% of issued shares. We‚Äôre not even talking about float here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9shqtnw75qg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=363edeb45e8cfcf1e6cff1ba8ba166e0749ce708

As you can see from the blue line in the first chart above, there was one large short cover during the squeeze in Jan 2021, but since then, the short interest has been mostly flat up until July of this year at about 20M shares - despite the buybacks.

That‚Äôs from quarterly short interest reporting. Now, S3 reports that **10M shares were shorted below $7**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo7mhoad5qg91.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cc9dacca854c0a0f7e6fd13f121329d3d5e490

The short thesis here, again, is bankruptcy. Admittedly, this is not an impossibility, though the higher the share price goes the less likely (given the potential to do share offerings to raise capital).

So, nutso summary here:

* **80M shares issued**
* **85M shares owned by institutions and funds**
* **30M+ shares short, with 10M shorted below $7**

## Price action on 8/8 after hours on 8/9

I was pretty attuned to the GME squeeze in 2021 having written a lot of posts as part of my EndGame series. I‚Äôm seeing many similarities in behaviors. Here are some notes:

* Shorts tended to defend the price level of 2x their entry. For GME, this was $15.8, which was defended hard a few times, and when that level was lost it was squeezetown. $15.8 represented **2x the entry price of a large quantity of shorts.** Why is this significant? At 2x the price, your short is now at **-100% and it‚Äôs very likely your risk mgmt group is going to shut you down.**
* BBBY started going on 8/8 and in particular after hours. Why did we have a 16% spike after hours? **That started at $12.** **My hypothesis is that there were a group of shorts that entered at $6 and began to get force closed at -100%.**
* Premarket at 8/9 was sitting at **$13+**. If the market opened bbby at $13+, there would have been a slew of force closures from smaller and potentially larger short entities as that would represent -100% for larger and larger portions of the 10M short shares added under $7. **It was critical for shorts to move the price down. Do or die at $13.**

## So it's do-or-die, what do shorts do?

* Selling during low volume premarket to establish downward trend
* Shorting via synthetic shorts (short calls / long puts)
* Analyst downgrades

https://preview.redd.it/snvpahsh5qg91.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba2111b9a9b32a6f2d5ee0cd540325aedc2a148

* Potential astroturfing in WSB (low karma, low post history accounts sharing negative sentiment in daily thread)
   * A decent amount of algos follow sentiment in retail, and in addition to shorting you can astroturf social media investing sites to change sentiment
* Once BBBY hits -10%, they can‚Äôt short on the bid, so they establish sell walls to keep the price below ask (examples):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37lifq8l5qg91.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d24eb24f35033e1eae45703a253cdd71e4ba5eb

Additionally, today marked the opening of a slew of strikes upward, **which is generally bearish b/c a bunch of retards tend to buy the highest strike, leading to negative pressure on the underlying when MMs later dehedge those positions.**

## Where does that bring BBBY today?

1. Shorts have won the day, turning momentum around with a massive reversal from 13+ to $9 currently
2. However, they‚Äôre still sitting on 30M shorts, and probably more after today, with 10M+ entered below $7/share. So far, this hasn‚Äôt undone the beginning of this squeeze:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4sosc4oq5qg91.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a5b5011e344ec6b9aa557df23d3387817b49f2

Finally, short shares availability is quite low - **so there's no evidence that shorts have actually covered at all during the 5-day rally.**

&#x200B;

[Blue bars: short shares available. Red line is short borrow fee. ](https://preview.redd.it/uz4iys386qg91.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=524f21743a2735c778e44188acc1800f40be70fe)

## So what now?

The long game: The short thesis is bankruptcy for $BBBY. If $BBBY can avoid bankruptcy, the short thesis is squashed and they‚Äôll need to exit. This may not be today, tomorrow, or next month - but that‚Äôs the long game. Personally, I‚Äôm betting $BBBY finds a way to squash bankruptcy risk which will push this to a long struggle to get out for shorts.

The short game: It‚Äôs generally looking like retail is giving up the short game in the face of many strong short-seller tactics.

In my opinion, buying OTM calls just helps move the price down as MMs de-hedge, while shares reduce the pool of people that shorts can buy back from.

## UPDATE: OH SHIT.

## Just realized. BBBY short interest might be updating EOD TODAY! If that's true, that's another reason for the push down today.

**That‚Äôs an average close price of $4.9.**

**7M shorts were added to BBBY‚Äôs short basket at an average price of $4.9.** 

BBBY is currently at $10 after hours. **7M shorts are sitting on over 100% loss.**

Keep in mind in my previous post I shared that I don‚Äôt see any evidence of covering. 

Now, let‚Äôs look at [BBBY‚Äôs price between 7/15 and 7/29](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1657843200&period2=1659312000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true):

**That‚Äôs an average close price of $5.08.**

**500K shorts were added to BBBY‚Äôs short basket at an average price of $4.9.** 

## Summary: Shorts R Still Fuk

So, **7.5M shares were added in a month at an average price of $5,** there‚Äôs **no evidence of covering,** and **they‚Äôre sitting on a 100% loss at current prices.** 

Yeah, I‚Äôm going to see how this all plays out.

wizna5_O,O,I am the guy who 10X‚Äôd a $45K YOLO in BBBY. The following is my analysis on why I believe this run is just beginning‚Ä¶ (The Ryan Cohen Effect).," Hey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time ‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb3d24bf0a0bd8446e2a29b44a9c7bc945165041)

...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  


My Thesis on this Play is as follows -  
I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

  
After the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

  
‚Ä¶Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it‚Äôs lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- ‚ÄúBuy Buy Baby‚Äù. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.

  
With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC‚Äôs cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)

&#x200B;

[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)

  
As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  
That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.

  
Again, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I‚Äôm glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.

  
So again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of ‚Äúmeme basket‚Äù and bed Bath & beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.

  
So back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME‚Äôs stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.

  
I waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time‚Ä¶ either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.

  
As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  
Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.

&#x200B;

[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)

  
After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post‚Ä¶ I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)‚Ä¶.  
Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

  
The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  
So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  
Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

  
Thursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

  
Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  
So yeah‚Ä¶ I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  
Again, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of ‚ÄúMOASS‚Äù like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.

  
As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  
 It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.

  
In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).

In regards to the Yolo‚Ä¶

  
I Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, & the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  
I decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why‚Ä¶.

BABA, BAC, BBBY, WFC, APHA and more.","As I do each week, here's a look at the state of options volatility, what that means for this week in the broad ETFs, a look at some stocks in the news and a preview of this week's earnings. All through the lens of expected moves. The expected move is not a prediction of exactly how a stock will react, but an actionable signal of how options traders are pricing the moves. That can be applied to not only analyzing risk, spotting opportunity, but more specifically strike selection, whether that be covered calls, iron condors, or directional spreads (or to tell you how crazy your OTM call might be). As always let me know in the comments anything I missed or anything interesting on your radar.

### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** The **SPY** closed last week at new highs, up more than **2.5%** on the week, a move well beyond the **1.1%** move options were pricing. Despite that outsized move, market implied volatility in options fell even lower. The **VIX** is now below 17 and at its lowest level in a year.

**Expected Moves for the Week of April 12th:**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.3%

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uximm5slols61.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e088348a5d35c71d99bab800cd0fb56cdccc1ef

From a trader‚Äôs perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week‚Äôs 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020, it has spent the last few months compressing from the 30‚Äôs to where it is now.

## In the News

**Alibaba (BABA)** and the Chinese government reached a settlement on anti-trust accusations, the news was released late in the day Friday. As of Friday‚Äôs close, BABA options were pricing in about a **3.5%** move for this week, and a nearly **8%** move for the next month. That 3.5% expected move for this week corresponds to about **$231** for a bullish consensus and roughly **$215** for bearish ([chart](https://14eaka193uhe3z4zmwffpyc4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-11.58.19-AM.png))

### Expected Moves for Earnings

The lower levels of implied volatility in the broader market coincide with the beginning of earnings season. This week sees some of the large financial institutions like **JP Morgan**, **Bank of America**, **Goldman Sachs** and **Wells Fargo**. The latter part of the month features some of the largest tech names including **Netflix**, **Apple**, **Tesla**, **Amazon** and **Facebook**.

### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** The **SPY** closed last week at new highs, up more than **2.5%** on the week, a move well beyond the **1.1%** move options were pricing. Despite that outsized move, market implied volatility in options fell even lower. The **VIX** is now below 17 and at its lowest level in a year.

**Expected Moves for the Week of April 12th:**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.3%

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

From a trader‚Äôs perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week‚Äôs 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** The **SPY** closed last week at new highs, up more than **2.5%** on the week, a move well beyond the **1.1%** move options were pricing. Despite that outsized move, market implied volatility in options fell even lower. The **VIX** is now below 17 and at its lowest level in a year.

**Expected Moves for the Week of April 12th:**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.6%
* IWM 2.3%

**SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$406** as a *bearish consensus* and **$415** as a *bullish consensus*. A 1% expected move is down significantly from the 3% weekly expected moves from just a few months ago. Here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs expected move in SPY, highlighted on the chart:

From a trader‚Äôs perspective, hedges and outright directional positioning costs less than they have in more than a year. Actual moves in the market can quickly go beyond what options are pricing. Last week‚Äôs 2.7% move higher in the SPY is a prime example.

Short premium strategies, where an investor collects premium (income) from selling options, are also affected by lower volatility. It forces a choice between selling options that are closer to the current stock price (giving less room to be wrong) or continuing to sell further out the money options and receiving less premium (giving a lower risk / reward ratio).

On Friday I compared two short premium strategies, the covered call, and and Iron Condor. [You can read that comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mnkpww/covered_calls_are_good_for_getting_called_away/) (reddit link) and see how the expected move plays a part in those types of trades.

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020, it has spent the last few months compressing from the 30‚Äôs to where it is now.

## In the News

**Alibaba (BABA)** and the Chinese government reached a settlement on anti-trust accusations, the news was released late in the day Friday. As of Friday‚Äôs close, BABA options were pricing in about a **3.5%** move for this week, and a nearly **8%** move for the next month. That 3.5% expected move for this week corresponds to about **$231** for a bullish consensus and roughly **$215** for bearish ([chart](https://14eaka193uhe3z4zmwffpyc4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-11.58.19-AM.png))

EPS growth: Positive. 
Q420: Expected positive wich they will announce on 18th i think.
** The growth on this one is stable and feels good every day you go higher

Bought 300 stocks at 50.29  Leverage x1
Atm +16.58%  

Bought 50 stocks at 50.38 Leverage x5
Atm  +81.38%

Take Profit at Price Target 62 (Last was at 60, increased because of its daily increase) or 19 Feb.
Even if its performing well i dont want to be greedy and increase more the Price Target. 


IRTC: 
Price target: 288 max - 170 min
EPS growth: Positive. 

Bought 60 stocks at 175. 21 Leverage x1
Atm +0.88%

Bought 10 stocks at 171.18 Leverage x5
Atm +16.30% 

Take Profit at price target 185 (previous 200) 
Its resisting alot in this price thats why i decided to set close profit lower. 


LUMN: Still Cautious (Not anymore this is going well) 
Price Target: max 17 - min 9
EPS: Low - Maybe in future it has some ptential to increase a little

Bought last time 10 stocks at 11.77 Leverage x2
Atm: +11.72%

Bought 50 stocks at 11.53 Leverage x5
Atm: +39.90%

Take Profit at price target of 13.8( Last was 13.5) 


This stock was my last investment and was the first to hit price target

BBBY:  This one i think has the most risk of the above going low 

Bought 30 stocks at 26.43 Leverage x5
CLOSED @ GAINS 52.77% 

Take Profit at price target 28.7 but this one has a stop loss at 25 or probably i will close this one by myself, not bad for a high risk investment.
This was a High Risk & High gain Investment wich ended well.


The gains from this was diversified into 2 other mid range stock's.

NEW MID RANGE INVESTMENTS

WELL:  This is my replacement for BBBY High Risk & High Gain, It look like a good stocks with improvements in previous period with so good stats like  revenues, net income, eps etc. 
Because it hasn't fully recovered from covid i want to get on the spike i belive it will happen in next week.

Bought 10 stocks at 63.04 Leverage x5
Atm: + 13.09% That was f****ng fast.

Take Profit at 68.5 (was thinking to put it on 68 but because of the sudden spike i made it +0.5 didn't want to be greedy)

Stop Loss at 60 but still monitoring it closely to manually close this one also.

AYX: This was and is so undervalued... I couldnt let the chance not to buy after the today's dip. It's potential it's close to the first one EHTH but should do more DD on this one if i want to invest more than the half of my BBBY Gains. 

Bought 6 stock's at 117.48 Leverage x5
Atm - 4.89% The most of this loss are from the app huge margins so as you open your trade you get - 1% instantly -_-  w/e still it has potential. 

Take profit at 134 ( This will be adjusted in the future because it has a nice potential) 

Stop Loss at 105

Everybody believed COVID-19 would be a headwind, but it actually proved to be a tailwind for them. It was so easy to write all of them off against Amazon - but what happened?

The reason I went with this stock was due to the dividend growth being consistent for 5 straight years, the stock price being much lower than I expected it to be (due to the nature of the business and the quality of their products in comparison to their competitors), and the dividend yield being at 6.17% at the time, according to dividend.com. The dividend yield was a bit high for me at the time but I believe it to still be a good starting stock to test the market with.

BlackBerry ‚Äî BlackBerry posted a breakeven quarter, compared to consensus estimates of an eight cents per share loss, but revenue was well below forecasts. The company did give a full-year forecast that calls for a loss of 15 cents per share, smaller than consensus, and said it is on track for 30 percent growth in software and services.

Accenture ‚Äî The consulting firm matched estimates with earnings of $1.41 per share for its third quarter, with revenue exceeding Street forecasts. It also raised its full-year earnings forecast, as margins expand and new bookings grow.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals ‚Äî The drugmaker's stock was cut to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" at JPMorgan Chase, which cites ongoing core product challenges.

Boeing ‚Äî Morgan Stanley began coverage on Boeing with an ""overweight"" rating, citing significant margin expansion opportunity, as well as the stock's recent underperformance. Separately, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said demand for passenger jets is getting stronger, telling French newspaper Le Figaro that there will be demand for 38,000 new jets over the next 20 years.

Bed Bath & Beyond ‚Äî The retailer reported quarterly profit of 80 cents per share, six cents a share below estimates. Revenue also missed the mark as comparable store sales fell by 0.5 percent during the quarter. However, the company did affirm its prior profit outlook for the full year.

Intuit ‚Äî Goldman Sachs added the financial software maker to its ""Conviction Buy"" list, saying Intuit is doing a better job of retaining customers and due to increased confidence in subscriber growth for the company's QuickBooks Online service.

Twilio ‚Äî Twilio will begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange after pricing its initial public offering at $15 per share, above the expected range of $12 to $13 per share. The company is a provider of tools for app developers.

Red Hat ‚Äî Red Hat earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, matching Street estimates, with revenue also above forecasts. However, the distributor of Linux software gave a weaker-than-expected current-quarter outlook due to costs related to its newly announced acquisition of software provider 3scale. Red Hat also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.

Barnes & Noble ‚Äî Barnes & Noble said sales at existing stores should be flat to up one percent for the current fiscal year, as the bookstore operator moves to increase customer traffic. That's a better outlook than some analysts had been expecting.

Bank of America ‚Äî The bank is near a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case involving the safeguarding of client accounts, according to The Wall Street Journal. The paper said the settlement is expected to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.

Royal Bank of Scotland ‚Äî RBS has gotten a number of bids for its Greek shipping finance business, according to Reuters, in a possible sale that could be worth up to $3 billion.

Viacom ‚Äî Ousted directors can remain on the board for now, according to a Delaware court judge's decision, until a final determination is made on controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone's mental competence. Redstone moved to replace five directors last week and his National Amusements petitioned the court to affirm the move, but those directors filed suit to invalidate the dismissals.

General Electric ‚Äì GE reached an agreement to sell its French consumer credit unit, GE Money Bank, to private-equity firm Cerberus, pending approval by regulators.

Amazon.com ‚Äî Amazon was fined $130,000 by the Federal Aviation Administration for allegedly mishandling shipments of dangerous chemicals.
