**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

**1. BHP (**NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.  


**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",2025-05-20,13,3

1hxjeho_BHP,BHP,Moving on from Commodity ETFs: A New Chapter to BHP VALE RIO Neste,"After 9 months of waiting with little movement, I decided to sell my commodity ETFs today, locking in profits between 9% and 14%. It felt like the right moment to shift my focus toward individual stocks with strong fundamentals and exposure to the same sector.

I reinvested in:

BHP Group (BHP): A global mining leader generating over $55 billion in annual revenue. Focused on essential resources like iron ore, copper, and nickel, BHP is well-positioned for the energy transition.

Rio Tinto (RIO): Another mining heavyweight with $60 billion in annual revenue. Known for its efficiency, RIO excels in iron ore and aluminum, rewarding shareholders with solid dividends.

Vale (VALE): A key player in iron ore and nickel, with revenue surpassing $40 billion. Vale is crucial for industries like steelmaking and battery production, aligning with long-term demand trends.

Neste (NESTE): A renewable energy pioneer earning $25 billion annually. Neste specializes in sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, making it a standout in the green energy space.


By moving from ETFs to individual stocks, I aim to focus on companies with robust cash flows, growth opportunities, and competitive advantages. Looking forward to seeing how this new portfolio performs!",2025-01-09,5,3

But as a whole, the entire sector is going through troubled times. I don't know where is the bottom, but it appears that a lot of pain is already priced in. The primary motivation is coupon clipping. I looked into the FCF and it appears that the companies have sensible dividend policy - I actually like seeing dividend cuts in the years profits are low. 

I am interested in hearing what others think of the industry and if there are more interesting ideas. My current thinking is to diversify into these three stocks.

15icxva_BHP,BHP,BHP research:,"TLDR: Healthy, conservative business practices allow the company to weather economic storms. Dividends are paid as a percentage of profit, and economic downturns can provide attractive entry points for value investors.

&#x200B;

BHP is the largest miner in the world by market cap (154b) supplying iron, copper, and coal. They have spun off all of their oil operations, and are expanding into nickel and potash. They brought in 18b in profit this year and had a 8.8% dividend yield, meaning about a 75% payout ratio (consistently above 70%). Their TTM EPS however is slightly higher and if they keep it up profits will increase by 10%. The first half of the year tends to underperform the second half. Profit margins are consistently above 20%. D/E is decreasing (below 0.4), ROE and ROIC (both 20+% are healthy, and current assets are consistently 150% of current liabilities. They have about 90b in assets, and only 29b in liabilities (20b current assets). Capex is about 30% of net income. There is little change in the number of shares outstanding from decade to decade, thus I can infer that the company instead prefers to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends. 

  
Dividends do not stay the same year to year. The past two years have been exceptional, but if you look further back, the yield fluctuates wildly from under 2% to over 10%. If I look a little deeper, I find that the company has a policy to return greater than 50% of profits back to shareholders in the form of dividends. I have already gone over the financial health checklist, this is a well run, consistently profitable company. The dependent variable is the dividend returned to shareholders, and the independent variables are the demands for the metals they are pulling out of the ground. 

  
Heightened interest rates worldwide have not had their intended effects…yet. But they will. Worldwide construction will decrease, unemployment will increase, consumer spending will become financially prudent, and the energy markets will cease to innovate and revert to the lowest costs possible. This will have mixed effects on BHP, but because their revenue is dominated by their iron and copper business, the net impact will likely be a temporary decline in earnings and margins while the economy copes with depressed economic activity. The 8.85% yield is not here to stay.

  
The right times to buy BHP are defined by the fundamentals of the business, the current valuation, and the future economy. In 2009, BHP’s profit fell to ⅓ of what it was the previous year. The next year it was more or less back to normal. The balance sheet didn’t grow, but that was the extent of the crisis. The point is that BHP can get along just fine with decreased economic activity, and when the time is right, it can bring back operations to 100%. 

  
Graham would approve of the catalyst. The inability to predict global commodity prices in ten years time is the reason why I am not going to build a laughable innacurate DCF. When the business is feeling the full pressure of depressed economic activity, when their dividend has shrunk to a fraction of what it is now, when profits see serious decline, that is when the intelligent investor should decide to take action.  I have seen this all too often. Fear of what happens next translates to fear of taking action now. The intelligent investor is fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

One historical catalyst was in 2016 when a myriad of disastrous but one-off events seemed to happen all at once. A bad bet in petroleum shale, a dam disaster in Brazil, and a decline in global commodities prices saw the market cap fall by 60% in a year. It took BHP 3 years to recover the lost valuation.

BHP Group, formerly known as BHP Billiton, is a massive Anglo-Australian mining company. It's the largest mining company in the world by market cap, and the second-largest in the world by revenue. 

BHP Group, like Royal Dutch Shell, is listed twice on the NYSE. If you're looking to buy, and you're American, be sure to buy BBL. (The other listing comes with an Australian dividend withholding tax.)

This high of a payout is atypical for BBL. It paid out this high once, cumulatively, back in 2019, but otherwise for the past decade it has paid an average of $2.32/yr with an average yield of 4.88%. 

British companies typically pay out only biannually. This is the second, and likely last, distribution that BBL will pay out this year. They pay out in March and September, unless there is a special dividend. 

The payout date is September 21st.

Already have a 6 month emergency fund, around $12,000 superannuation (similar to Roth IRA I believe)

Anyway I'm wondering if I should sell like 1/2 or 3/4 of those shares and diversify (and pay capital gains taxes on that) or just keep them and buy ETF's with the remaining cash, because BHP is a massive mining company and extremely diversified as well. 

Any advice is much appreciated. ",2014-04-19,4,5

Who is primed to take their market share?","BHP Billiton, the largest mining company in the world based out of Australia, is selling off their assets for producing aluminum, manganese, and nickel. I did a lot of research today and think Alcoa is primed to take over, but that is based on the fact that Alcoa and BHP Billiton jointly own a mine in Brazil and their business relationship I feel is the best candidate to take the BHP marketshare. I could not find information specifically to what industries BHP sells their finished aluminum to.

Here are some articles that I used for research

 Who would have thought Australia would deserve close scrutiny for investment? Not me... That is, until I visited Perth (on the opposite side of the continent to Sydney), in Western Australia. I visited in 2009, at the height of the great recession, and was immediately struck by the dynamic skyline. There were cranes everywhere; skyscrapers were being erected at an energetic pace. The population was cashed up and on the spend. Everywhere I went people were excitedly expounding on the virtues of “the minerals boom.” My interest was piqued.

I did some digging and found something very interesting, Australia's Fortescue Metals Group (ASX [FMG] American depository receipts [FSUMF] and [FSUGY] very profitable). This company looked like a sleeper to me, I had heard about BHP Biliton [BHP] and Rio Tinto [RIO], but I had no idea that this quiet company is the fourth largest producer of iron ore in the world...

Petrohawk Energy agreed to be acquired in a 12.1 Billion dollar deal by BHP Billiton plus taking on $3 billion in company debt which would value the deal at $15.1 billion.  This mining company has been looking to diversify into the energy space for quite some time and finally found its takeover.
