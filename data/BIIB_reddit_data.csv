1gdd4py_BIIB,BIIB,Why Did Biogen’s Stock Drop Despite Strong Earnings and Analyst Upgrades (Aug 2024)?,"I’m trying to understand why Biogen’s stock dropped right after its \*August 2024 earnings call\*, even though the company reported strong numbers, raised guidance, and received multiple analyst upgrades. All the indicators—company performance, analysts, and earnings—were positive, so why did the market seem to ignore these and push the stock down?

To be clear, I'm not looking to debate trading vs. investing strategies or the randomness of the stock market. My question is straightforward: given that both the company and the analysts seemed to signal ""buy"" or ""hold,"" why did the market make an independent decision to sell?

Looking for some insights here, so if you don’t know or just want to yell ‘market’s random,’ kindly move along without blowing my mind. If anyone can provide insights on why this happened that’d be appreciated.

1g0ef4o_MS,MS,BIOGEN ($BIIB) a value buy at its 5-year low,"Despite being at a 5-year low, I think $BIIB is a great value buy. Current price offers a lot of value opportunity, and with two recent EPS beats, a lot of cash on hand, strong pipeline for new treatments - I think expanding existing drugs and/or launching new ones with strong clinical trial results will turn this around.

Note, investing in Biotech requires time and patience given the lengthy approval processes for products to materialize.

First off, Biogen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company, which engages in discovering, developing, and delivering therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. They have therapies that treat multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Alzheimer's disease.

**Here's why it's a good value buy:**

* The last two Quarters they had EPS expectations beat. Notably Q2 was a 30% surprise beat. 
* It's profitable, solid cash flows, good balance sheet. They have a relatively low P/E ratio compared to other biotech firms.
* It has a ton of cash - which is a good buffer, going into some market ambiguity I suspect. Additionally, good to have cash for R&D or some acquisitions. 
* As of August 2024, according to Argus Research, the Return on Equity is at 14.4% in August which is up from 8% in March. 
* **I'm optimistic about their new CEO Chris Viehbacher who wants to bring in more early-stage medicines, and focus on diversifying the pipeline beyond core products.** He even said on the last earnings call ""*One of the things I'd like to see us do is really bring a lot more assets in from an early stage because the earlier you can acquire these assets, the more shareholder value you can create.*""
* 2023 they were focused on cost-cutting so, those cycles tend to take a year or so to feel the effect on the balance sheet. 
* They have some dividend potential, and with a strong cash position they could allow for dividends in the future or share buybacks. 

  
**Playing Devil's advocate I would say the following could compromise the value**:

* Overreliance on core products and not expanding fast enough by bringing in more early-stage medicines. If the Alzheimer's treatment (Leqembi) suffers any setbacks in expanding, then that would hit them pretty hard. In general, they have some concentration risk.
* The failed launch of another Alzheimer's treatment called 'Aduhelm' led to some declining revenues, bad blood with the FDA, upset customers and of course frustrated shareholders. The former CEO Michel Vounatsos stepped down after so, therefore I hope the new CEO can inspire building back those relationships.
* Aduhelm was a massive commercial failure, that had a crazy high cost, was limited in its coverage by Medicare, and sparked a lot of ethical concerns regarding the FDAs drug approval process. So BIOGEN needs to really focus on making sure this doesn't happen again.

tl;dr

Biogen is a large, established player in the biotech space with strong fundamentals, and while it faces near-term challenges, its cash position, future pipeline, and cost discipline offer a compelling long-term investment case. It's undervalued by at least $50 from it's current price ($185.76) - could be an 50% upside from here. ",2024-10-10,0,26

1cbvveq_BIIB,BIIB,"Biogen tops profit estimates as cost cuts take hold, Leqembi launch picks up","Biogen on Wednesday reported first-quarter profit that topped estimates as the company’s cost-cutting efforts took hold and sales of its closely watched Alzheimer’s drug, Leqembi, came in higher than expected.

Biogen and Eisai’s Leqembi became the first drug found to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease to win approval in the U.S. in July. The treatment’s launch has been sluggish, but uptake appeared to accelerate in the first quarter. 

Leqembi brought in about $19 million in sales for the quarter, up from the $10 million the drug generated last year. That blows past the $11 million analysts had expected, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. 

The number of patients on the therapy increased nearly 2.5 times since the end of 2023, according to Biogen. The company added that the number of new patients who started Leqembi jumped in March, making up more than 20% of the cumulative patients now on the treatment. 

Biogen did not provide a specific number of patients using Leqembi. In February, Biogen CEO Chris Viehbacher told reporters that there were around 2,000 patients currently on Leqembi.

The company hopes the drug and other newly launched products will drive growth as it cuts costs and sees sales plummet for its multiple sclerosis therapies, some of which face generic competition.

Here’s what Biogen reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $3.67 adjusted vs. $3.45 expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

The biotech company booked sales of $2.29 billion for the quarter, down 7% from the same period a year ago. It reported net income of $393.4 million, or $2.70 per share, for the first quarter, up from net income of $387.9 million, or $2.67 per share, for the same period a year ago. 

Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of $3.67 per share.

Biogen reiterated its full-year 2024 adjusted earnings forecast of $15 to $16 per share. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected full-year earnings guidance of $15.49 per share. 

The company also reiterated its 2024 sales guidance of a low- to mid-single digit percentage decline compared with last year. 

Newly launched drugs top estimates

Apart from Leqembi, investors also have their eyes on other newly launched drugs. 

That includes Skyclarys, brought in by Biogen’s acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals in July. That drug notched $78 million in fourth-quarter revenue.

Analysts had expected sales of $68.8 million, according to FactSet estimates. 

The FDA cleared Skyclarys last year, making it the first approved treatment for Friedreich ataxia, a rare inherited degenerative disease that can impair walking and coordination in children as young as 5. In February, European Union regulators approved Skyclarys for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia in patients ages 16 and up. 

Biogen has also partnered with Sage Therapeutics on the first pill for postpartum depression, which won FDA approval in August. But the agency declined to clear the drug for major depressive disorder, which is a far larger market. 

Biogen said that pill, called Zurzuvae, generated first-quarter sales of $12 million. Analysts had expected just $5 million in sales of that drug, FactSet said.

Multiple sclerosis drugs, other treatments

Meanwhile, Biogen’s first-quarter revenue from multiple sclerosis products fell 4% to $1.08 billion as some of its therapies face competition from cheaper generics. 

The company’s once-blockbuster drug Tecfidera, which is facing competition from a generic rival, posted revenue of $254.3 million in the first quarter, down from $274.5 million from the same period a year ago. 

Still, that came in higher than analysts’ estimate of $227.7 million, according to FactSet. 

Vumerity, an oral medication for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, generated $127.5 million in sales. That came in below analysts’ estimates of $137.9 million, FactSet estimates said. 

Biogen’s rare disease drugs recorded $423.9 million in sales, down from the $443.3 million in the same period a year ago. 

Spinraza, a medication used to treat a rare neuromuscular disorder called spinal muscular atrophy, recorded $341.3 million in sales. That came under analysts’ estimate of $415.1 million in revenue, according to FactSet. 

Biogen said the timing of Spinraza shipments and increased competition affected first-quarter revenue comparisons outside of the U.S.

The company’s biosimilar drugs booked $196.9 million in sales, up slightly from the $192.4 million reported during the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected sales of $192.5 million from those medicines.

[**ALLISON GATLIN**](https://www.investors.com/author/gatlina/)  4:21 PM  07/15/2021

Biogen stock tumbled Thursday after the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai said they won't administer the company's controversial Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm.

In a statement emailed to Investor's Business Daily, the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic said a panel of experts reviewed the scientific data associated with **Biogen**'s ([**BIIB**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) aducanumab, the test name for Aduhelm.

""Based on the current data regarding its safety and (effectiveness), we have decided not to carry aducanumab at this time,"" the clinic said. ""However, we support continued research in this area and, when additional data become available, we will then re-evaluate this medication for use in our patients.""

New York-based Mount Sinai said its group of Alzheimer's experts is writing out best practices for Aduhelm while another group is putting together formulary addition protocols. The clinic also awaits the outcome of an Office of Inspector General investigation into Aduhelm's approval.

""The FDA's approval of Aduhelm has raised serious concerns and questions by clinicians, patients and caregivers and a cautious approach is required,"" Mount Sinai said in a statement emailed to IBD. ""Mount Sinai Health System will not administer Aduhelm until the outcome of the FDA Inspector General's Investigation of Biogen is complete. Depending on this outcome, if appropriate, our experts will follow formulary addition protocols and consider best practices for Aduhelm to inform clinical practice.""

On the [**stock market today**](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), Biogen stock skidded 6.8% to 328.16.

**Biogen Stock Dives On Coverage Issues**

The fact two notable medical centers won't administer Aduhelm doesn't bode well for adoption. Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed questioned whether others might follow suit. This could put expectations for $9 billion in peak Aduhelm sales at risk, he said in a note to clients.

It's also another move pressuring Biogen stock this week.

Biogen said it remains committed to helping appropriate patients access Aduhelm.

""Medical decisions should be based on science and data, so it is disappointing that patients living with Alzheimer's Disease may reportedly not be able to access Aduhelm at some facilities,"" the company said in a statement emailed to IBD. ""Biogen continues to stand 100% behind Aduhelm and the clinical data that supported approval.""

The company also referenced comments from Janet Woodcock, acting Food and Drug Administration commissioner, during Stat's Breakthrough Science Summit on Wednesday. She said the approval was ""based on very solid grounds"" and ""the right thing to do for patients.""

But, according to Stat News, Woodcock also acknowledged the FDA could have handled the approval process differently to minimize the controversy. The FDA approved Aduhelm using an accelerated pathway that gives Biogen nine years to run a study confirming the drug's benefit on cognition. An advisory committee earlier voted against recommending the approval.

**Medicare Decision Expected In 2022**

Also this week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began the process to determine if it will cover Aduhelm. This process, called a national coverage determination, could limit the number of patients eligible to receive Medicare reimbursement for Aduhelm.

Medicare expects to have a final decision within nine months. In the meantime, local contractors in 12 regions will determine [**coverage for their areas**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-to-review-coverage-for-new-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-11626130325), according to The Wall Street Journal.

Medicare reimbursement will be key. Without it, many patients will be responsible for the drug's $56,000 annual price tag. It's still unclear who will foot the bill for the costly scans to check for beta amyloid in patients' brains. Aduhelm removes the ""sticky"" plaque associated with Alzheimer's.

But the Cleveland Clinic's decision wasn't based on the price tag, Mizuho's Syed said. He reiterated his neutral rating and 244 price target on Biogen stock.

""It's based on the data, not even financials, which I thought was interesting,"" he said.

Lecanemab is also being studied in a large trial on people with evidence of amyloid in their brains, who do not yet have symptoms of the disease.

The FDA grants breakthrough therapy designation in order to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions.

 **KEY POINTS**

* **A third member of a key Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has resigned over the agency’s controversial decision to approve Biogen’s new Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm, CNBC has learned.**
* **Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the agency’s decision on Biogen “was probably the worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history,” according to his resignation letter obtained by CNBC.**

A third member of a key Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has resigned over the agency’s controversial decision to approve [Biogen](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIIB)’s new Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm, CNBC has learned.

Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the agency’s decision on Biogen “was probably the worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history,” according to his resignation letter obtained by CNBC.

“At the last minute, the agency switched its review to the Accelerated Approval pathway based on the debatable premise that the drug’s effect on brain amyloid was likely to help patients with Alzheimer’s disease,” he wrote in resigning from the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee.

He wrote it was “clear” to him that the agency is not “presently capable of adequately integrating the Committee’s scientific recommendations into its approval decisions.”

“This will undermine the care of these patients, public trust in the FDA, the pursuit of useful therapeutic innovation, and the affordability of the health care system,” he said.

Shares of Biogen surged 38% on Monday after the FDA approved the [biotech company’s drug](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/biogen-ceo-says-56000-annually-for-alzheimers-drug-is-fair-promises-not-to-hike-price-for-at-least-4-years.html), the first medication cleared by U.S. regulators to slow cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer’s and the first new medicine for the disease in nearly two decades.

Biogen’s drug targets a “sticky” compound in the brain known as beta-amyloid, which scientists expect plays a role in the devastating disease. 

The FDA approved the drug under a program called accelerated approval, which is usually used for cancer medications, expecting the drug would slow the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients. The agency granted approval on the condition that Biogen conducts another clinical trial.

The agency’s decision was a departure from the advice of its independent panel of outside experts, [who unexpectedly declined to endorse](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/biogen-suffers-setback-after-alzheimers-drug-fails-to-win-support-from-fda-panel-.html) the drug last fall, citing unconvincing data. At the time, the panel also criticized agency staff for what it called an overly positive review of the data.

At least two other FDA panel members have resigned as a result of the agency’s decision on the drug. Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman and Washington University neurologist Dr. Joel Perlmutter have also submitted resignation letters.

“I was very disappointed at how the advisory committee input was treated by the FDA,” Knopman told Reuters. “I don’t wish to be put in a position like this again.”

Federal regulators have faced intense pressure from friends and family members of Alzheimer’s patients asking to fast-track the drug, scientifically known as aducanumab, but the road to regulatory approval has been a controversial one since it showed promise in 2016.

In March 2019, Biogen pulled development of the drug after an analysis from an independent group revealed it was unlikely to work. The company then shocked investors several months later by announcing it would seek regulatory approval for the drug after all.

When Biogen sought approval for the drug in late 2019, its scientists said a new analysis of a larger dataset showed aducanumab “reduced clinical decline in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease.”

Alzheimer’s experts and Wall Street analysts were immediately skeptical, with some wondering whether the clinical trial data was enough to prove the drug works and whether approval could make it harder for other companies to enroll patients in their own drug trials.

Some doctors [have said they won’t prescribe](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/02/alzheimers-community-awaits-fda-vote-on-biogens-aducanumab.html) aducanumab because of the mixed data package supporting the company’s application.

Stock jumped A LOT yesterday on news and is around 343 now so both calls are deep ITM (302.5/282.5). Is there any way to manage this trade to minimize my losses at this point? I've been using a profit/loss calculator to look at different options for rolling the strikes up and/or out but all the scenarios look like I'll just lose more. Does it ever make sense to close out/roll just the calls or just the puts or do you really need to work with the whole contract? Does it make most sense to just let it expire tomorrow or close it all out tomorrow?

I totally accept that I'm going to take a loss on this one so I'm not looking for a magic bullet. I want to make sure I learn something from it though, so going forward I know the best way to handle this situation once I'm in the trade.",2020-11-05,68,52

jfebcg_BIIB,BIIB,Biogen Quarterly meeting today/earnings,"Expected eps 8.14 actual 8.84
    BIIB Biogen has posted earnings today I think it’s been a positive day for Biogen despite the media narratives being negative. 
Media is focusing on Tecifedra a MS medication revenues being less than previous quarter due to a couple factors. Corona virus, and competitors. 

I believe the articles focus on only negative aspects for some reason concerning phase 2 failure of opcinimab. 

The positives are that tecifedra consumption is actually up, but maintenance doses are less than initial doses. They are selling more in other countries and emerging markets, spoke of regulatory talks with Japan China as well as others. 

Next month the true factor is USDA pending approval on their upcoming Aducanomab treatment for Alzheimer’s next month. Biogen has been preparing for a full release as planned and was optimistic about approval. 

This would really impact Biogen in a huge way if accepted, and there has been good evidence to believe it will be. The company has shown to be undervalued as it maintains a strong balance sheet and just spent 5bn? (Don’t remember exactly) on stock buybacks announced today. 

Now if Adu- fails to be approved it could have an adverse affect on other pending approvals from other countries, same if its accepted then Biogen would have a greater chance of some other medications being pushed through in the rest of the global market.

I remain optimistic, and the media narratives pushing this price low right now really makes it an attractive buy. Some revenue from its MS drugs have been pushed over to help Adu- prepare for launch. I’m 45% concentrated in Biogen and if accepted by USDA we could see this stock go extremely high, even past the 52 day average up into the high 300’s mid 400’s per share. Currently sitting at 262. I’m super excited! 
Feel free to clarify some things I may have missed or messed up.",2020-10-21,4,0

Mylan in an inter partes review (IPR) was challenging Biogen’s ‘514 patent, which covers the treatment of multiple sclerosis with 480mg dose of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the active ingredient of Tecfidera. The patent provides market exclusivity in the United States until 2028.

Per the statement from the PTAB, generic drugmaker Mylan failed to demonstrate that some claims were not patentable.

Though Mylan announced its intention to appeal against this decision, the favorable ruling raises hopes for Biogen’s chances of maintaining Tecfidera’s exclusivity until 2028. Tecfidera constituted 39% of the company’s total product revenues in 2019.

The news removes a short-term overhang from the company. Biogen also faces a generic litigation in a court case related to the same patent. The favorable ruling increases the chances of winning the court case.

Shares of Biogen have increased 7.8% in the past year versus the industry’s decrease of 0.1%.

￼

Notably, in 2017, Biogen strengthened its patent position for Tecfidera through a settlement and licensing agreement with Danish biotech Forward Pharma A/S regarding the same patent. Per the settlement, Biogen agreed to pay $1.25 billion for buying the license to Forward Pharma’s intellectual property covering DMF.

Meanwhile, last week, Biogen delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2019 results. The company beat on both earnings and sales in the reported quarter.

Revenue growth in the quarter was principally driven by higher sales of its key MS drugs, continued global growth of its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza and expansion of its biosimilar business.

Notably, Tecfidera has been one of the top revenue drivers for Biogen over the years. The drug generated sales worth $4.4 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector include Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. XENE and Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. KALA, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Xenon Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 12.04% for 2020 over the past 60 days. The stock has soared 85.7 % in the past year.

Kala Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 0.9% for 2020 over the past 60 days.

eznvix_BIIB,BIIB,$BIIB to have first and only Alzheimers Therapy on market,"I posted my $100k tendies on the patent approval today for Biogen but thought I’d also give a heads up to a potential FDA approval of the worlds first alzheimers treatment (which also treats Parkinson’s as bonus). 

Expected imminently, the result should clearly be a catalyst for near term rocket fuel should it receive FDA approval. 

It’s gone through multiple roller coaster fun times but we are done with human trials and things seemed to go very smooth. 

They also recently started buying out the market of any patents and medications that could compete so they appear to have high confidence of an approval. 

Surprisingly FOMO hasn’t started on it yet but I would assume it will start soon with its recent rocket launch on the patent ruling for another of its drugs which is what made me the $100k today :). 

Anyway, biotech always a huge risk huge reward but thought I’d share with y’all in case you wanna jump off the $TSLA train for a bit and join me and help treat Alzheimer’s with our generous monies.

i am an investor only interested in capital gains instead of dividend growth. I want to talk you guys about a stock i've been following recently to see what's your thoughts on that.  
The stock I am taking about is the multinational biotechnology Biogen (**NASDAQ:BIIB**) and it's current traded at 224$.

This stock have seen in March a 20% down in price due to an halt of Alzheimer's research disease, which created a buying opportunity.  
The company was founded in 1978 and for the last 10years have been rock solid in their earnings growing from 3.35$ to 21.58$, from 2009 to 2018. The company is almost debt free and have a shareholders equity return of 30.74% and a return of total capital of 23.29%. The profit margin is at 32.93%. Over the last 10years the company have been repurchase his shares which is always a good sign and the current P/E just hit the lowest P/E of the last 10 years, 8.19.   
The price to book ratio is at 3.15 and its in line with the rest of the industry.  
This stock have a potential of CAGR in stock price of 20.99% according to past EPS and should be traded around 1574.22$ 10 years from now.  
For me, this company is undervalued and have a lot of room to grow in the next 10 years.
