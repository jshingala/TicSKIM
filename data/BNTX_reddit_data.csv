1gu7m4p_MRNA,MRNA,BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success. This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance. Other thoughts are also open and welcomed!",2024-11-18,16,23

Pharma in general seems to be on a price decline. I'm new to researching this industry but so far BNTX is my favourite company I've seen and they seem to be trading at a cheap price. Their P/E ratio is currently 5.2. 

Can any pharma buffs give me reasons not to buy BNTX? 

Also I wouldn't buy on P/E ratio alone + would do more DD but this seems to be such an outlier and I'm keen to know if others like this or if it's a red herring.",2023-12-01,10,17
17kt3u0_PFE,PFE,Thoughts on Biontech - BNTX; sell before earnings?,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I’ve owned Biontech since start of covid when I bought it because I read in the Economist that it was developing a vaccine. I was up about 10x at peak in summer 2021, sold a tiiiiny bit, and I’ve held the rest for last few years as it has sunk like a stone… I’m still up 2x but considering selling out entirely since ongoing demand for covid vaccines seems quite low. I suppose there are two key issues against BNTX for me:

2. their product seems almost **too effective** for it's own (financial) good meaning that

* a) a smaller proportion of the total population need a vaccine to get some kind of effective level of herd protection from Covid than I/Mr Market previously assumed
* b) a smaller proportion of the population need a repeat/booster vaccine to ensure on-going protection than I/Mr Market had previously assume

1. BNTX only make money from COVID vaccines, meaning they have no other revenue streams currently

&#x200B;

An idiosyncratic, additional point for me is that I already own substantial amounts of Pfizer, PFE, which sell BNTX's vaccine, meaning I already have exposure to market demand for it, so by continuing to additionally hold BNTX I'm effectively doubling my exposure while losing the diversification Pfizer provides...

&#x200B;

Finally Pfizer's earnings today from their Covid vaccine were even worse than expected... this implies Biontech's will be too on 6 November, surely...?

&#x200B;

So what do we think... time to tear off the band-aid and dump BNTX? I guess I have a slight disposition not to sell because it's fallen so much from the highs in 2021 that I irrationally want to hold until it (somehow) recaptures them...",2023-10-31,2,2

vet3pq_BNTX,BNTX,Take a look at Moderna (MRNA) and Biontech (BNTX) PE and Cash . . . cheap,"Yes, Covid vaccine earnings will likely decline substantially going forward -- but will you look at how cheap Moderna and Biontech are? Amazing. Trading at 3 and 4 X trailing earnings, tons of cash, now with vast experience in a technology with huge promise . . . trading as though they were going out of business.

Moderna likely has the better Covid franchise, Biotech a more interesting mRNA pipeline, and Pfizer the best business. . . . but really, you're getting a chance to buy a proven revolutionary technology, from two companies that have more experience than anyone, for a very cheap multiple.

. . . better than any private market venture biotech financials, you'll see.

So yeah, folks loved these shares at $450 and now hate them at $120. Go figure . . . it's not like the economy changes vaccine consumption, and neither company has much in the way of financing needs or inflation effects. 

Full disclosure, I'm long both . . . ( generally just an index investor, but this was appealing  enough to actually buy some shares ). mRNA technology is a whole lot more than just Covid vaccines, and MRNA, BNTX and PFE have a giant advantage with hundreds of millions of doses actually manufactured and delivered.",2022-06-17,4,12

s9bnj3_BNTX,BNTX,"100 years of revenue, guranteed for BionTech","For all the retards who think that the pandemic is over and time to dump the vaccine stocks as they will make no revenue, its time for a history lesson. Sanofi and GSK make $10B a year on a flu pandemic that happened 100 years ago (1918 spanish flu). Covid is not over, the variants are still on the rise. We need boosters forever. The current vaccine makers, specially the mRNA tech based ones are going to make money for the years to follow, I bet for the next century. Out of two mRNA vaccine makers, Moderna ($MRNA) and BionTech ($BNTX), my personal bet is on BionTech,

&#x200B;

* The insiders didn’t sell a single share Vs Moderna sold around $2B worth.
* The CEO, Prof Uğur Şahin is a Professor, oncologist and immunologist, he currently owns 17% of the company, He and his wife, Dr. Özlem Türeci who is also a scientist and physician run the company, she doesn’t own a single share, but in for the science.  vs Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel is a harvard MBA.
* BNTX make more money than MRNA even after splitting profits from Pfizer.
* current EPS $34 vs $16. Current market cap of Biontech is $39B vs $69B for Moderna. Both got corrected 60% from the ATH in the past two months.
* Both have Flu + Covid vaccine boosters in the pipeline, capturing market share from Sanofi and GSK.
* BNTX have their own manufacturing sites as well as their big daddy Pfizer. Vs moderna contracts out to Swiss company Lonza ( whose share price rose to 50% in past year).
* Currently, BNTX only has FDA approval and emergency use authorizations across all age groups 5years+ >. They have approval and supply in over 126 countries. Every soul is a potential customer.
* They will have a different pricing for their boosters after the pandemic is over.
* BNTX has bigdaddy Pfizer backing, they both are working on Flu and shingles vaccine together with less than a 100 day turnover development time (mRNA tech folks)
* BNTX has 26 other pipelines ([https://biontech.de/science/pipeline](https://biontech.de/science/pipeline))
* The current price is 60% discount from its ATH.

I believe BNTX has better future position, with more phase 2 trials and if i can recall, Ugur Sahin researching on cancer vaccines before covid even existed. The phase 1 trials do look promising. 

BNTX has 50/50 profit share with Pfizer on covid vaccine. Way more shots than MRNA

MRNA also has cancer therapies in the pipeline but less numerous, and historically less experienced with cancer therapy. They are rolling out a CMV vaccine and orphan disease gene therapy potentials (probably won't be making much money on the latter, however)

I've just looked at their financials, both companies have similiar revenue,

but I can't comprehend why Operating cash flow is 10 times smaller for BNTX, which translates into a meager FCF.

p95gs2_BNTX,BNTX,BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns,"  

**BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns**

I was motivated to make this DD post because while these vaccine stocks have been crazy hot over the past year, they don't get much attention on WSB which is a bit surprising.  These aren't for the faint of heart, but traders looking for volatility, you won't need a blue pill to get hard.

I will try to highlight some of the key differences and you can make a choice of which you prefer.  My personal choice is BioNTech, reason being they are much cheaper when comparing financial metrics, and also because I think their vaccine is the best in terms of safety and efficacy.  It is also what I'm vaccinated with, and the 5G reception has been great.

**Pfizer & BioNTech partnership**

Most folks refer to BioNTech’s vaccine as ‘Pfizer’, but the vaccine actually belongs to BioNTech, but licensed to Pfizer with profit split down the line in most regions as well as milestone payments to BioNTech ($748 million).  There is also a small equity investment in BioNTech by Pfizer.  Pfizer was interested in acquiring BioNTech, but the owners have no interest in selling. 

**Making history as the first FDA approved mRNA vaccine**

In recent news from Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech is to become the first fully FDA approved vaccine as early as this Monday. First mover advantage is key to locking down market share, as well as advancing the mRNA vaccine booster approvals. With the mRNA technology platform vetted with an FDA approval, Pfizer/BioNTech will be moving yet further ahead of the competition.  Mandates will start soon as this is approved, and BioNTech will be the first choice.  Also, BioNTech is in more arms, and the boosters are advised to follow the primary shots so they will also lock up a lot of doses.

Moderna approval is said to be several weeks away, so they aren't far behind either if things go their way.

Comparing BioNTech and Moderna based on market cap and financial metrics, Moderna currently has a higher valuation/multiple even though BioNTech has double the earnings per share. 

&#x200B;

[Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/87y6mjkiuti71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=081f5a5bcff8974ec6fc8721bf1f60d91dcbe7be)

For the next ten years, the COVID vaccine revenues will be the drivers for these companies. I won’t go into the scientific differences between the mRNA vaccines, as this is WSB and I’m not epidemiologist or scientist. 

We know both vaccines are very similar and effective but differ by dosage (Pfizer having 30 micrograms vs Moderna having 100 micrograms per dose). Both of these will require boosters for the foreseeable future with what looks like 8 month intervals (though Moderna may have longer durability due to the dosage). Science supports this since the virus will continue to mutate. Countries such as Canada have already ordered boosters for the entire population out to 2024. 

**Ownership and Insiders**

BioNTech is 50% owned by the Strüngmann brothers, who seeded the company. Next the CEO Ugur Sahin owns around 17% of the company. This means 67% of the stock is basically out of the picture. These guys have not sold a single share as this has run up from single dollars to $465.

Institutional ownership as of the last report was approximately 17%. This means that 84% of the shares (out of 241 million) are not being actively traded, leaving a paltry 38.5 million shares. 

Moderna while having more shares outstanding has a very strong institutional ownership base of 64% of float, and 10% by insiders, so 74% of the shares are spoken for. Since Moderna is an S&P component (BioNTech is a German company, listed as an ADR so does not qualify for it), it gets more volume and institutional interest. In the last six months, about 11 million shares have been sold by insiders, which is not unusual given how well it has performed. 

From a share structure perspective, I think the low float and high ownership by the founders of BioNTech make it possible for more upside, but both are currently Wall Street darlings, and Moderna gets more attention in the media.

**Marketshare**

Pfizer distributes the vaccine to 165 countries around the world. The net profit from the sale of the vaccine is split 50/50 between Pfizer and BioNTech.

[More primary shots = more boosters](https://preview.redd.it/7v8rld7puti71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e11bdcc618de17192efb61d7b2b0defc7660ee)

BioNTech separately has a deal with China based Fosun Pharmaceuticals to distribute in Asia. Fosun is to start production in China at the end of August upon administrative approval (regulator approval already happened last month), eventually producing up to 200 million doses a month to supply Asia. Pfizer/BioNTech did not take US government money to develop their vaccine, which makes it an exception. BioNTech did get $445 million from Germany for the development.

Moderna has a smaller reach currently than Pfizer/BioNTech in terms of global distribution and have had some issues scaling fast enough to meet contracts.  However, they are expecting to produce 800-900 million doses for 2021, and up to 3 billion in 2022. Moderna had significant funding by the US Government ($6 Billion), so they are not in a good position to attempt raising prices in the US (though I have heard they may have recently, not sure).  

Pfizer/BioNTech wins the distribution hands down, as they were first to launch and scale their production in mass. Also in the US, the BioNTech is able to be given to ages 12 and up, whereas Moderna is currently 18 and over. This could change, but recent reports suggest BioNTech is perhaps a better choice for younger folks due to fewer side effects compared to Moderna, perhaps due to the difference in dosage.

**Pipeline**

For pipeline, they both have a lot of treatments under development based on mRNA technology. They both are going to be very cash rich, and will have no issues funding and expediting their candidates with no financing concerns for the foreseeable future. Now that they’ve proven mRNA delivery technology and safety, they are both targeting blockbuster drugs (cancer, HIV).  They will also grow via acquisitions.

BioNTech pipeline has a heavy focus on oncology, 21 or 27 of their candidate are cancer related. They also have another partnership with Pfizer to develop a flu shot which started Phase 1 earlier this year. BioNTech has one drug in the phase 2 stage - BNT122 for metastatic melanoma.

Moderna has a more diversified pipeline (HIV, Zika, Flu). They just started human trial of their HIV vaccine.  They also have a treatment for cytomegalovirus that is expected to begin phase 3 trials in 2021, and in phase 2 have a cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, to be given in combination with Merck’s Keytruda.

**Technicals**

BioNTech has consenus of $320.44 and Moderna $276.45, but these includes some older targets which have yet to be updated.  BioNTech has had multiple upgrades over the past two weeks ($450 Canaccord, $433 Goldman).  Moderna has recent targets of $425 by Jeffries and $461 by Goldman.  

Both of these stocks are extremely volatile.  They went parabolic in recent months and got overbought.  They both fell 30% from recent highs in a matter of days, but are now consolidating and inching up again. The selling of these were not based on any fundamental news, but technically the vertical move couldn't be sustained. Earnings blowout and some criticism by some analysts on valuation are mentioned as catalysts, but I think they just went up too far, too fast. This is a run of the mill correction, but I suspect it has now run it's course.  It's given a great opportunity for new investors to get in at a discount to recent highs.

Keep in mind they both have high correlation to each other, so they almost always move together, but MRNA has outperformed BNTX as of late.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1tdbel5uuti71.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=35e47c33df3823c1865bf34a98a4ccecd8ee5154

I believe both of these will at least retest all time highs (464 for BNTX, and 497 for MRNA), possibly go even higher if we get another variant after the delta that requires further changes to the vaccine (this is probably more likely that we'll want to admit).  The pipeline for both is promising, and these trade more like tech stocks than biotech since mRNA has proven with the COVID vaccine that it will revolutionize the industry and both of these companies are at the forefront.

**Risks:**  The biggest risk is the variants mutate to something less deadly, less warranting booster shots. In my opinion these stocks will likely peak then decline sometime in early - mid 2022 as the pandemic changes into an epidemic.  There is also risk of competition, but I think these have such a commanding lead, I don't see anyone choosing another vaccine over these, given the billions of doses and FDA approvals they will have ahead of the competition.  Folks are turning down Astrazeneca and JNJ, willing to risk waiting unvaccinated for one of the aforementioned mRNA vaccines.

TDLR for those who can’t be bothered to read:

**In a nutshell:** Both are great plays on COVID and mRNA, especially now that boosters are now seen as durable reoccurring revenues (though they are expected to decline after 2022). Like the flu, we’ll be getting COVID shots many years from now based on science and history (flu pandemic of 1918, we’re still getting shots due to variants and waning immunity, the same issues plaguing us with COVID).  However, BioNTech is fundamentally much better valued than Moderna as the EPS is double that of Moderna, and they have the first mover advantage and brand awareness (due to Pfizer).  

**Disclosure:** I’m not a finance professional, just a retail trader. I own BNTX via call options and have no position in MRNA.  Do your own due diligence.",2021-08-22,64,67

p1m5nq_BNTX,BNTX,Help for short BNTX call recovery,"Long story short, I did a short strangle on $BNTX last week at $360/$410 at a premium of $28.8. The breakeven for the trade is roughly at $330/$440. And the loss I'm willing to accept is 2 times the premium I received, which makes the range within my expected lost at $300/$470. To do a recovery, I shorted another call at $470 yesterday for $8.00 thinking that it will not hit it since it's highly overvalued now.

Then $BNTX opened strong premarket today raising to $459 which is already testing my upper limit. May I know what are the recovery strategies that I can further take? Should I wait till Friday to cut the loss or should I just take the loss now and learn from it?

Ways I'm planning to do:

1. Roll my untested $360 Put to $410, close my $410 Calls and $470 Calls at a loss. Buy OTM calls expiring this week, probably around 490$.

Update 12.30pm: I decided to roll my put to 20Aug’21 $410 @ $13.00. (Current paper loss of -$5.00 due to the dip but I’ll hold it till expiry, the buy wall at $390 is very strong). I’ll let both my calls expiring this week run and take the profit/loss at the end of week.

Update 9.45pm: The calls I sold are OTM now but my recovery play($410 put) expiring next week is ITM, current paper loss of -$6, when market opens it would be at least -$16.

Update 12.18pm: It turns out my recovery play was the one that killed me, anyway as of today I've exit all but the 2 calls position at $410 and $470 expiring this week. Realized loss of -$800.",2021-08-10,4,14

Germany-based BioNTech S.E. (NASDAQ: BNTX) is the co-developer (with Pfizer) of one of the COVID-19 vaccines. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 370%, and for the year to date, shares are 380%. The stock jumped about 9% on Wednesday following a report that the FDA would soon approve the vaccine, removing the emergency use authorization under which it has been distributed since late last year.


Another vaccine maker, Moderna, reported better-than-expected results Thursday morning and announced a $1 billion share buyback. Investors are never happy: the stock traded down about 2% afterward.

Analyst sentiment on BioNTech is decidedly cool. Of 12 brokerages covering the stock, eight have a Hold rating and the other four are evenly split between Buy and Sell ratings. The stock trades at around $392.50, more than double the median price target of $184.11 and just $6 (1.5%) below the high price target of $398.44.

For the second quarter, analysts expect BioNTech to report revenue of $3.88 billion, up 61.4% sequentially and 91% above the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS are forecast at $8.96, up 74% sequentially. In the second quarter of 2020, the company posted a loss per share of $0.38. For the full year, analysts are looking for EPS of $35.95, compared with a year-ago total of $0.07.

The stock trades at 9.8 times expected 2021 EPS, 10.8 times estimated 2022 earnings and 18.4 times estimated 2023 earnings. The stock’s 52-week range is $54.10 to $433.90. BioNTech does not pay a dividend.",2021-08-07,31,33

n5hu3s_BNTX,BNTX,Why I am bullish on Biontech BNTX,"Hey guys, this is my first serious DD here.

1. Fundamentals

Biontech has 238 Million Shares available. The price is around \~190$ right now.

 Which means the market cap right now is 45Billion $

Ownership:

50% belong to Andreas and Thomas Strüngemann under AT Impf, they were early investors since 2008.

22% is Inside-Ownership like the Owner Ugur Sahin who holds 16%

11% is institutional ownership.

So 83% of the total float is pretty much locked up.

&#x200B;

Revenue and Winnings. 10th of May is their next quarterly call.

So as many of you know Biontech produces the covid vaccine which Pfizer distributes in the US. Pfizer and Biontech share the winnings.

In 2021 Biontech will gross around 20 billion$ in Sales.  80% of that will be winnings.

So around 35% of the market cap right now are winnings of 2021.

But this isnt just it. 

Biontech is the first company who will get admission for people under the age of 16.

Biontech is about to anounce a deal with China to sell them around 100M to 500M doses by july.

The vaccine will last around 6-9 months, then you will need another shot. Because antibodies will be too low. Biontech produces mRNA, which is far better than adona-shots like Johnson & Johnson or Astra-Zeneca-

&#x200B;

Biontech will be able to produce around 3 Billion doses a year. They can make around 10$ Profit for each dose. We dont know if we need another shot in 2023 and forward, but it seems possible.

&#x200B;

But this is just the beginning, the true reason of biontech was to find a cure with mRNA against cancer.

Now they have around 10B $ in cash for research and 14 clinical trials running.

You wanna imagine how much money they will make with the cancer industry?

At least 10M people a year get diagnoses with cancer. 

This is how much a cancer patient costs (a raw show from 2010)

[https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html](https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html)

Lets just be very conservative and say they make 4000$ profit for every patient and have just 20% market share at 10M patients. That would be 8 billion a year of profits scaling up over time as the population gets older. 

And this is very conservative.

&#x200B;

Plus we dont know what else they can do with the mRNA technologie.

&#x200B;

So, if they find a cure against cancer with mRNA with 10B$ a year in profit, that should be worth 200B$ Market cap. Plus they will problably make 40-50B $ with covid vaccines. 

Their longterm market cap should be around 200B$ -250B $ and this doesnt account their very good reputation and first mover advantage in a new powerful science technologie with lots of room for new discoveries.

Which should put their longterm stock price from 190$ current to around 1000$ by 2024-2025 at least.

&#x200B;

So, I am buying shares since a long time plus buying longterm call options, which went up nicely already.

&#x200B;

Looking forward for feedback, thank you for your time

TLDR BNTX, I like the stock

\*this is not financial advice, I am literally a retard\*


Edith 1: There is still a high risk of escape-mutations, in that case the world would need more vaccines in the future. Even if by mid-end 2022 the whole world is getting vaccinated and corono is over, there is still a chance it goes back to animals, mutates and comes back here.

Also biontech has the best reputation worldwide of all vaccines. The CEO Ugur Sahin seems to be very competent. They will and are getting the best researchers worldwide.

And even if you believe it wont go higher, it would still be a good hedge in your portfolio, if the corona-virus finds another escape-mutation that threatens the world economy",2021-05-05,16,82

lxf7xt_BNTX,BNTX,Why all hate $BNTX?,"Here comes my first dd. Sorry for my bad english but i am a retarded german guy.

I will try to analyse why all people hates Biontech. I got some Biontech shares (100@99) but some pfizer shares too (320@31)

Most people seems not unterstand that pfizer is only a ""reseller"" of biontechs vaccin.

Look at yesterday: Brazil orders 100 Million dose of vaccin. Pfizer gains 3% und Biontech lose 4% after that news. The vaccin will mainly produce by Biontech. Pfizer is the Partner for Europe & North- and South America Continent. Fosun for China.

Look at some numbers: Some new Production Places will be open soon. Biontech will produce (min) 2 Billionen doses in 2021. The most are allready sold, some Options for more doses are arranged. Biontech and Pfizer expect more then 15 Billion sales (each).  Biontech should more (Asia + German market). Biontech should make up to 8 Billion profit.

All shares have a volume of 19 Billions Euro together. Do you see the relationship between market capitalization and sales? I am retardard and can only count 1,2,3

Why Biontech is falling down?

Biontech gets 13,6 Millionen Euro in 2008 from MIG Capital. They sold some shares (now over 600 Millionen Euros Profit). They are venture capitalist and dont't go too long.

Is that the only reason?

We have the same situation as Mid December. Biontech starts falling on many good news. What? Yes. No bad news. Many shorter starts playing with Biontech. It droped from 100 Euro to 70 Euro. After some days it going back to 100 and the Short Volume going down.

Look at: [https://nakedshortreport.com/company/BNTX](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/BNTX)

The situation repeats.

Why US people hates Biontech? I dont't know.

Let us look at the last days:

Main German market time (9 to 15:30) => Biontech going up (arround 1,4% every day)

NYSE opens => Biontech falls massivly down (arround 4-5% every day)

Today: Biontech starts as every day in germany. We got arround 1% but a massiv nervously Market.

My Plan? I Invest much more in Biontech

Thanks ...

No purchase recommendation! I am new at the business. I don't know what i am do

Edit:

Whats up next (i forgot it):

MRNA is a great MarketChanger. Biontech has many things in the pipeline.  
Something in Phase1: Against:  
\- Advanced Melanoma (Adjuvant and Metastatic)   
\- Prostate Cancer   
\-  HPV16+ Head and Neck Cancer   
\-  Triple Negative Breast Cancer   
\-  Ovarian Cancer   
... many more (i hope 1 will come throw Phase 3)

Influenca combined with C19 (Cash Maker for the next year)

And with BNT122 ( 1L Melanoma with CPI ) a Product in Phase 2

In the Pre Phase there are things against HIV,  Tuberculosis , and more.

If not all products fail => Cash, if all fail => i am totaly wrong

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

BNTX is up 185.75% with more room to go higher after they get confirmed Emergency Use Authorization and orders roll in.

MRNA is up only 45.75% which is still not bad. There is more room to go higher here once their efficacy numbers come out later this month.

I noticed that you guys aren't really talking about the matter at hand in the world today: Corona. All this time I've spent in this subreddit I thought that I missed out on hitting big, but now that I've learned to take advantage at the matter at hand, I feel like I've finally found something useful to be here for. When the COVID vaccine comes out, It's going to be a HUGE deal, and I was thinking that maybe we should take a look at Pfizer (PFE), Biontech (BNTX), Moderna (MRNA), and/or AstraZeneca (AZN), the leaders in the race for the vaccine, so we can see them as an opportunity for this subreddit and its future. They have done the most testing for the vaccine and there is a possibility that one of them may release it first, and when that happens, millions of people will go get vaccinated around the world. Again, this is a big deal, because it means that we finally won't have to worry about dying from Corona anymore, and we can return to life like it was pre-2020. This vaccine could be the ticket to full economic recovery and the liberation of millions from our houses and back on the streets.

Now I'm going to tell you what to do when it comes out: if your money is in a company other than the one that released the vaccine first, immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY, sell it and put the money into the other company so you don't lose much. The companies that didn't make it first will plummet due to reduced demand.

Also note that I'm not recommending the Chinese companies because, you know, they could be used to influence us.",2020-09-10,0,15

* * *

An experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the drug giant Pfizer and the biotech firm BioNTech spurred immune responses in healthy patients, but also caused fever and other side effects, especially at higher doses.

The first clinical data on the vaccine were disclosed Wednesday in a paper released on MedRXiv, a preprint server, meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. 

The Pfizer study randomly assigned 45 patients to get one of three doses of the vaccine or placebo. Twelve receive a 10 microgram dose, 12 a 30 μg dose, 12 a 100 μg dose, and nine a placebo. The 100 μg dose caused fevers in half of patients; a second dose was not given at that level.

Following a second injection three weeks later of the other doses, 8.3% of the participants in the 10 μg group and 75% of those in the 30 μg group developed fevers. More than 50% of the patients who received one of those doses reported some kind of adverse event, including fever and sleep disturbances. None of these side effects was deemed serious, meaning they did not result in hospitalization or disability and were not life-threatening.
