Now I have to imagine the degeneracy of our society would lead people to borrow from them at 20% APY and plow those proceeds right into the stock market only to get completely blown up this year. Only a matter of time before those default rates skyrocket.

So what if I borrow money from UPST and load into puts on UPST ($11 target 2022 lows) and then UPST goes bankrupt? Would I even have to pay back the loan?",2025-04-05,55,32

1il6mr8_BP,BP,Activist Elliott Said to Build Stake in Struggling Oil Major BP,">Elliott Investment Management has built a significant stake in BP Plc, according to people familiar with the matter, as the British oil major struggles to win back investor confidence and reverse years of underperformance.

>The activist fund is seeking to boost shareholder value by pushing the company to consider transformative measures, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. Elliott believes BP is significantly undervalued and its performance is disappointing, they said. The exact size of the stake couldn’t be immediately learned.

>Representatives for Elliott and BP declined to comment.

>BP has fallen about 8% over the past five years, while its Big Oil rivals from Shell Plc to Exxon Mobil Corp have risen by at least 30%. The company under former Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney embraced net-zero in a failed bet that oil consumption had peaked, and has since struggled to present a clear strategy for a turnaround.

>With a market value of about £69 billion ($86 billion), BP is worth less than half of Shell today.

>

>CEO Murray Auchincloss, an insider who stepped into the role after Looney was dismissed over his personal conduct, is widely expected to outline a clearer shift back toward oil and gas when he presents a much-anticipated strategy update on Feb. 26. However, investors have been growing impatient, including after BP warned in October that its share buybacks could slow this year.

>BP is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results on Tuesday, and has already flagged broad weakness across its business for the period. While its biggest rivals also reported lower earnings in the last three months of the year, analysts view those companies as having a clearer direction and stronger balance sheets.

>Elliott’s move is the latest in a series of high-profile activists taking on Big Oil. Exxon lost an battle to ESG-leaning Engine No. 1 in 2021, while Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC took a stake in Shell in the same year, calling for the company to break off its liquefied natural gas, renewables and marketing divisions into a standalone business.

>Elliott has in recent months successfully pushed for a breakup at Honeywell International Inc., which announced this week it would split into separate publicly traded companies. The fund also disclosed a stake in Anglo American Plc last year during BHP Group’s attempt to acquire the London-based miner.

>It also has a long history of taking stakes and pushing for changes at energy companies, including campaigns at NRG Energy Inc. and Canadian oil producer Suncor Energy Inc. in recent years.

>BP stock is held by a wide range of institutional investors. The company’s prolonged underperformance has prompted some commentators to suggest that its best option could be to find a buyer, pointing in particular to Shell, which could reap significant costs savings and growth in the US and create a British-Dutch champion, or other rivals such as ConocoPhillips or TotalEnergies SE.

>Auchincloss announced last month the company would cut about 5% of its workforce to reduce expenses, and was planning further cost-cutting efforts over this year. The company has stopped or paused 30 projects since last June to focus on the ones that make the most money.

[https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html)

If you sign up for free you can see the rates. Right now we're pricing in a 25bp cut, TERM SOFR has never been wrong.

I think the market has priced in a 25bp cut in US and a 25bp (TIBOR) hike on Japan which is a 50bp spread, this will be a bit of a shock for the markets due to further unwinding of the ""Yen Carry"". So we probably get S&P downside 5%+ with a spike on VIX (40ish) shocking people who bet long on a rate cut.

This thesis works to crush bullish rate-cutters.

US Bonds are discounted right now which fits this thesis; the vacuum of money into bonds will be big basically needing to cover 75bp of cuts that are ""unpriced"".

Further evidence of this indexed move is in companies like SO, PM, LEN and etc. All did well after cuts and these have pulled back in anticipation of a run on all time highs while the market flounders.

Other solids like MSFT have not ""outperformed"" either. This timidity all suggests they'll run on the rate cut. But for them to run it balances out the index at large opening that potential 5% pullback thesis. A nice solid dip on ""rotation"".",2024-10-22,0,9

1f97d6c_AMD,AMD,Nvidia says it didn’t receive antitrust subpoena from DOJ,"

Nvidia on Wednesday denied reports it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.

“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia representative told CNBC. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Nvidia had received a subpoena, causing the stock to [slip in after-hours trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/nvidia-slides-in-post-market-trading-after-drop-wiped-out-300-billion.html). The chipmaker’s shares had already given up nearly 10% during regular trading Tuesday.

While the report did not specify a reason for regulators to be interested in Nvidia, the company’s recent rise has been directly tied to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips for data centers years before competitors AMD and Intel started taking the category seriously.

Nvidia has more than 80% of the data center AI chip market, according to industry estimates.

Nvidia “wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” Nvidia told CNBC.

Regen BioPharma, [(OTC-PINK: RGBP)](https://regenbiopharmainc.com/) and (OTC-PINK: RGBPP) is a biotechnology company working in the immunology and immunotherapy space. RGBP is focused on rapidly advancing novel technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials. Currently, RGBP is developing mRNA and small molecule therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders.

RGBP plans to rapidly advance novel technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials. Currently, RGBP is advancing therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders by modulating the immune checkpoint NR2F6. RGBP is also developing products treating blood disorders using small molecules and gene silencing (DiffronC), treating cancer with cellular immunotherapy (dCellVax, tCellVax, Dura-CAR, KimerApt), modulating key molecular processes in cancer stem cell through its patented molecular targeting approaches (BORIS), and repairing damaged bone marrow in patients with aplastic anemia and chemotherapy/radiotherapy treated cancer patients (HemaXellerate).

RGBP Expects Second Phase of Confirmatory Study Shortly

On October 18th RGBP reported on its current development of a genetic approach to regulating NR2F6 levels in human T cells. RGBP has recently received unexpected and potentially extremely useful data from one of its contract research organizations (CRO) retained to perform experimental studies on the Company’s DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic. These studies demonstrated that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct expressing siRNA for NR2F6 can be successfully created.

“A second unrelated CRO is currently performing qRT-PCR tests to determine if NR2F6 mRNA is elevated or inhibited by our CAR in T-Cells,” says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to RGBP.” If NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed (stimulating certain immune functions) then this product shows potential for treatment of cancer and if NR2F6 mRNA is elevated (suppressing certain immune functions) then the product shows potential for treatment of autoimmune disorders.”

Once RGBP receives the data, it will analyze the results and report the findings in a press release in order to keep the company’s shareholders informed of its progress.

RGBP Receives First Phase of Confirmatory Study

CAR-T Cells Created

On October 10th RGBP issued an announcement covering its previously discussed initiation of a series of experiments to validate its DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic ( [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regen-biopharma-inc--begins-experiments-validating-its-proprietary-car-t-cell-therapy-301623585.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regen-biopharma-inc--begins-experiments-validating-its-proprietary-car-t-cell-therapy-301623585.html) ) while also identifying new, unexpected and potentially extremely useful findings in developing cell therapy treatments for autoimmune disorders [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/studies-on-regen-biopharma-incs-duracar-indicate-potential-suppression-of-autoimmunity-company-retains-contract-research-organization-to-conduct-additional-confirmatory-studies-301931365.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/studies-on-regen-biopharma-incs-duracar-indicate-potential-suppression-of-autoimmunity-company-retains-contract-research-organization-to-conduct-additional-confirmatory-studies-301931365.html).

RGBP then reported it had received the first set of confirmatory data which demonstrates that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 were successfully created. In addition, the siRNA that is designed into the CAR T-cell was very highly expressed. Subsequent RGBP studies will determine if the expression of NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed or enhanced as a result of the high expression of siRNA.

“This is a major accomplishment in moving this model forward into therapies because in order to test whether we can genetically manipulate NR2F6 levels, we have to be able to produce a CAR T-cell where we demonstrate expression of this siRNA,” says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to RGBP. “We are excited to see the results on NR2F6 expression. If it is inhibited, we will focus on using these DuraCAR cells as originally envisioned - to attack solid tumors. If it is enhanced, we will begin re-tooling these cells to treat autoimmune disorders.”

15wfln1_BP,BP,BP - appealing potential,"BP is a dividend-growing stock that is moving towards renewable energy while continuing to produce oil and gas. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the pandemic have affected the company's fundamentals, but they are stabilising and exhibiting growth potential. Due to its low valuation and strong dividend and buyback programme, BP makes an appealing investment. 

  
Although the corporation recognises that renewable energy sources hold great promise for the future of energy, it also takes advantage of business opportunities in the oil and gas industry. The corporation invests substantially in LNG (liquified natural gas), one of the most significant potential, and it will gain more notoriety as Europe stops importing natural gas from Russian pipelines. As Europe switches to renewable energy, BP can support the continent's gas demand.  
Across the board, BP is significantly investing in renewable energy. For customers waiting for their autos, it makes investments in EV (electric vehicle) charging stations and convenience stores. The fuels of the future, hydrogen and biofuels, are also investments. While hydrogen is clean, primarily green hydrogen, biofuels are carbon neutral. Having access to new green fuels and charging infrastructure will put BP in a good position going forward. Electricity will be used for transportation, and hydrogen and biofuels will be used in industries.

  
A recession is a significant risk for energy industries. During recessions, expenditure declines, which lowers demand for fuel and energy. Now that the economy must deal with rising rates, which decrease investments and spending, there is a possibility of a slump. The EPS of BP will be adversely impacted in the near and medium term if the world experiences a recession.  
The oil and gas sector, which makes up the majority of BP, will remain unchanged over the next few decades. The business also hopes to expand by making investments in brand-new areas related to renewable energy and green electricity. The corporation doesn't have the same advantage it does in oil and gas because it lacks knowledge in these areas.

At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.

For the oil and [natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html) industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations. 

A good case in point is [a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653) struck between **Haliburton Co.** (NYSE:HAL), **Microsoft Inc.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Accenture Plc.** (NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.

 Halliburton is hardly alone.

After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.

Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs and transportation operating costs.

According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including **ExxonMobil** (NYSE:XOM), **Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google’s parent company **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG)[ has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud) its partnership with **Schlumberger Ltd.** (NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile, **Amazon Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[ oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts **BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and **Shell Plc** (NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.

 

In many cases, Big Oil’s digital makeover is quite extensive.

For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields. 

For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies’ enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including  rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton. 

However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations. 

Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend. **J.P. Morgan** estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. ",2023-04-03,9,6

Good roadmap for net-zero emitions

From what i can see, oil is going to still be relevant for many years forward, and the future of oil is simply lower emitions. Becouse of this, and their rapid upscaling, i believe AkerBP is a good investment.

* The recent payroll data revisions have caused a shift in the baseline forecast for the March FOMC meeting from a pause to a 25bp hike.
* ***The revisions also raise the probabilities for a wide range of policy outcomes, including an increase in the magnitude of hikes, an extension of hiking, and the possibility of the next move being up after a Fed pause.***
* ***The updated data shows that if the pace of job gains from January is sustained, a 50bp hike may be firmly on the table for debate.***
* The FOMC statement shifted the focus from the pace of increases to the extent of increases, and Chair Powell suggested that the March Summary of Economic Projections could include a lower path for rates.
* The incoming data releases, including jobs and inflation prints, will provide important information on the extent and pace of the Fed's tightening path.
* ***The February payroll report is expected to show net job gains of 200k, and a repeat of a 500k+ jobs print could lead to a 50bp hike as early as the March meeting.***
* The labor market may see more resilience, which could extend the tightening cycle.
* The underlying demand dynamics point to a slowdown in jobs, and the recent job gains are likely to be a one-off and not inflecting upwards.

10a624f_BP,BP,The market is pricing in a 92% chance of a 25bps hike in February,"Reference: [https://i.imgur.com/Pl3ZfVg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Pl3ZfVg.jpg)

Over the past week, the bond market has continued to price in a higher chance of seeing a 25bp hike at the next Fed meeting. As you can see in the screenshot, a month ago, the odds were at 35.1%, a week ago it was at 62.6%, yesterday it was at 76.7%, and today, once we received the inflation report, that number has flown to 92%.

So with that being said, even though we haven't heard anything concrete from the Fed as to whether they'll go for a 25 or a 50 hike, it looks like the market has made up its mind.

The risk here is obvious. If Powell does decide to go with another 50bps, then there would be a massive sell-off.

As a side note, the bond market continues to price in a fair chance of rate cuts in the later half of this year. There is only a 10% chance being priced in that the Fed rate is >5% by EOY. This is at a big contrast to what Powell has been saying which is a) No rate cuts in 2023 b) Plan to stay at 5.25% for some extended time.

In other words, the bond market doesn't believe in what Powell is dishing out, and the market believes that Powell is bluffing.

Edit: Adding more numbers

For the March 2023 Fed meeting, the market is pricing in a 18% chance that there will be no rate hike. Meaning that the bond market sees a 18% chance of there being a 25bp hike in Feb, and that will be the last hike. But there is a 80.2% chance of there being a 25bp rate hike in Feb and another one in March.

In keeping with this rather lofty goal, BP further threw their hat into the RNG ring with the purchase of Archaea Energy (NYSE: LFG).

Archaea Energy (NYSE: LFG) is a large RNG producer operating in the states (producing around 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d) of RNG).

&#x200B;

Players like $EVGN, operating in Canada, seem to be well poised and on the right track riding the tailwinds of the sector. A few things, in my opinion, make $EVGN an attractive company in its early stages compared to the potential they have:

&#x200B;

>\- Long-term contracted, predictable revenue stream  
>  
>\- Underwriting projects targeting EBITDA Margins of 50-60%  
>  
>\- Strong RNG Macro tailwinds with significant RNG demand still largely unmet  
>  
>\- Sustainable and contributing to a greener shared future  
>  
>\- Significant pipeline of growth with road map to C$30M in EBITDA  
>  
>\- Pure-play RNG consolidator with mixed waste projects which allow for waste tip fee revenue on the front end and RNG offtake revenue on the back end

&#x200B;

$EVGN is a major player in Canada in terms of contracted RNG offtake volumes and the leading Canadian pure-play consolidator. As they grow, they will become an attractive acquisition target (assuming a myriad of other factors go well).",2022-10-24,8,2

The inflation we are experiencing today is a combination of cost-push and demand-pull. As the summer comes to an end, supply chain bottlenecks should open up; however, if the Fed raises rates too quickly before the supply chain can adjust then we will see an increase in unemployment and thus a drop in GDP (according to Okun's law) and enter a recession.

\-bp takes a 40% production loss just by selling its rosneft stake. 

\-bp takes a 25 billion dollar loss

\-bp gets 14 billion putting their net debt at 16 billion still significant.

\-bp will end their jv which will account for another write down and another dubbeldigit loss

&#x200B;

conocophillips is now bigger then BP.

the loss doesnt seem to be priced in yet.

 bp had their enitre production upside linked to rosneft and wanted to bring their own production down with about 60-75% excluding rosneft. but that still would include their jv's in russia

without a lot of early exploration  bp is either forced to invest a significant amouth in production or they need to transition fast because becoming a diversified company with 500k in barrels total production is very inefficent so we would see a lot of divestments in the coming years aswell.

rosnefts dividends to bp are about as big as bp to its own shareholders. so rosneft sort of payed bp's dividend.

bp is a shell of it self with a terrible upstream business left behind and paying a lot for reneweble assets. they do have a good downstream business and balance sheet will only have 16 billion in debt is payble in less then a year. 

bp was significantly undervalued because of the deep horizon disaster, covid19 and now this.

&#x200B;

the war is a hit for the entire industry 

shell has less then 5% of their oil and gas production and a significant part of their lng production 10-20% and a 950 million dolar in nordstream 2.

chevron has signifcant pipeline structures but their oil and gas production is in kazichstan.

bp is the biggest loser here still without there being a second big loser. shell and chevron can afford the loss and still be profitible this year or even break even in the quarter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - BP is abandoning its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft in an abrupt and costly end to three decades of operating in the energy-rich country, marking the most significant move yet by a Western company in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production and divesting the 19.75% stake will result in charges of up to $25 billion, the British company said, without saying how it plans to extricate itself.

BP chief executive Bernard Looney to resign from board of Rosneft with immediate effect

Helge Lund, BP chair, says the company has operated in Russia for over 30 years with ""brilliant Russian colleagues"" but says the invasion represents a fundamental change:  ""Russia's attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region.""

Bernard Looney, chief executive:   ""I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine.....our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region....and looking at how BP can support the wider humanitarian effort""

\- That's a big hit. Not really clear if they can just sell this stake. Could be a big hit for the shareholders.One estimate i read is that it reduces the future free cash flow with 10%. For comparison: Deep water Horizon disaster costed the company  $64 billion (so far). ",2022-02-27,1353,208

Recent news:

Regen BioPharma signed a license agreement with Oncology Pharma for intellectual property pertaining to mRNA (messenger RNA) to be used in developing a therapy for treating pancreatic cancer.

The License IP consists of antigen-specific cancer vaccines in which modified mRNA is administered to produce epitopes able to produce an immune response which augments the likelihood of successful induction of immunity. An epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system.

Regen BioPharma signed two deals with Oncology Pharma. One is between Oncology and Regen for treating pancreatic cancer. The second is between Regen’s wholly-owned subsidiary KCL Therapeutics, Inc and Oncology for the treatment of colon cancer.

As consideration to Regen for the rights and license granted pursuant to the Agreement Oncology Pharma shall:

(a) pay to Regen a nonrefundable fee of $55,000 no later than April 20,2021
(b) pay to Regen royalties equal to five percent (5%) of the Net Sales as Net Sales are defined in the Agreement of any Licensed Products in a quarter.
(c) pay to Regen ten percent (10%) of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair market value as monetary consideration) received by Licensee from sublicensees, excluding royalties from sublicensees based on Net Sales of any Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment

As consideration to KCL Therapeutics for the rights and license granted pursuant to the Agreement Oncology Pharma shall:

(a) pay to KCL a nonrefundable fee of Fifty Thousand common shares of Oncology Pharma, Inc. no later than April 20,2021
(b) pay to KCL royalties equal to five percent (5%) of the Net Sales as Net Sales are defined in the Agreement of any Licensed Products in a quarter.

The 50,000 shares of Oncology Pharma are currently worth $1,700,000.

4. Regen is also not a 1 trick pony. They hold several patents and who knows what else they are working on. This deal is going to provide them freedom to keep pushing.

They also are releasing more filings and will be current soon. This is sometimes a battle with non-currents. We should be getting information on a regulars basis.

[Professional Chart (Chart School: shows potential comeback HODL support)](https://ibb.co/0GdFK85)

&#x200B;

Why did it spike? Well, why not? Look at the master chart above. Point blank, even an inexperienced trader can see this ticker is abusively over-sold by the top ticket bidders. It sold too harshly which evidently would be classified as an overreaction sell-off. When the sell-off reaction is completely consolidated (or over shorted), it maintains healthy support. With support, maintained line without tumbling down further, thus this ticker has a magnitude window opportunity for also a supernova & gap up window opportunity.

Risk management guide:

Safe Entry: 2.6

Safe Exit: 2.5

Danger zone: 2.23

Breakout confirmation: 3.6

The explanation why did CRBP dip. CRBP dipped because of the drugmaker's response to a negative late-stage readout for lenabasum in patients with a **rare** autoimmune disorder known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc). With that, brought 80% of this stock down severely.

The upside here however Lenabasum may ultimately redeem itself in another high-value indication. Corbus, after all, isn't that far off from releasing the drug's top-line results in cystic fibrosis. That's worth putting a little faith on the table.

&#x200B;

Pros to consider:

Not that old of a company ✅

Positive Q3 & Q4 for 2020 ✅

Wide gap room similar to OGEN ✅

Broke above HODL nearly crossing the 200SMA ever so slightly - nearly an outside bar candle. Likely to form an ascending breakout triangle. ✅

On 1/25/21, there's a money inflow index breakout (MFI) in the sub-chart behaving distinctively as OGEN, CTRM, & or SNDL. ✅

Cons to keep in mind:

The massive dip due to a clinical fail trial of a patient with a rare disease.

hejwxj_BP,BP,Maximizing Theta per Unit BP (Theta Efficiency),"For Option Sellers: What are the most efficient ways to maximize theta per unit buying power?  Consider all strategies, strike prices, expirations, etc.

For Example:   
1. Theta is higher ATM than OTM, but buying power is much higher for ATM naked puts or calls.  
2. Theta increases around 45 DTE as you approach expiration, but not as significantly when you get deep OTM.  
3. Vertical spreads reduce buying power significantly, but you sacrifice theta due to buying the long put.  
4. Calendar spreads similarly reduce required buying power but generally nets theta with the short put having larger theta than the long put.  
5. Short strangles will have higher theta than calls or puts alone since you are collecting theta on both sides.  
6. Higher IV underlyings or environments should have higher theta.  

I'm sure that I am missing many considerations.  What I am interested in is if any of you have experimented with the above combinations to maximize theta per unit buying power.  For example, I haven't crunched the numbers to see if vertical spreads with wide strikes nets more theta per $$ than naked positions.",2020-06-23,14,26

dmgv8q_BAC,BAC,Well-performing stocks to hold when starting portfolio? BPY-UN.TO (BPY Nasdaq)? BAC? MO? Or simply start with Dividend Aristocrats?,"   Hey all. 22 year old university student studying business in Canada, majoring in Economics and Finance. In my corporate finance course, we've recently been learning how to value stocks and bonds using different methods. Specifically, how to calculate revenue flows from the face value of bonds and their coupon rates, as well as stock prices based on the intrinsic value an investor places in a company and the dividends received. I've always know this is how the stocks are valued on the market, but haven't had the proper framework of thinking to fully understand this. My father used to tell me often about the power of compounding interest, over and over giving me the ""double a penny every day for 2 months or flat sum"" story, and it hasn't been until now that I've truly realized what that could equate to me personally. That is, if I put in the effort and show the discipline. 

   I've always been a major believer in accumulating wealth and allowing that wealth to work for you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't found the drive or necessity to make that happen for myself. After investing in my education, working hard at a serving position many days during school, and reducing my expenses as much as possible, I am fully committed to setting myself up for success. 

   I currently have about $1000 CAD to start a portfolio, and I have the intention of putting 70% of my tips accrued throughout the month into the portfolio moving forward. This will equate to about $600 CAD a month ($75x3days/week= $225 ; $225x.7 = $157.50 \~\~ $150). I've done a heavy amount of research into which investment style fits my personality and habits best, and the dividend growth method best suits my traits. Day-trading and swing trading feel more like informed (or uninformed, depending on your knowledge level) gambling. Although I do consider myself a risk-taker, I don't believe I have the experience and fortitude to tolerate the short-term, volatile goals of these strategies. I do have school to pay off, but my desire is to grow this portfolio as much as financially possible before I start accruing interest on my loans in just about 2 1/2 years. And to do this, I can't lose all of my assets invested due to my own lack of knowledge or insight.

   Now, I've done a fair amount of research into which stocks offer good yields, have good growth and have compiled a few watch-lists based on the criteria I've outlined. Thanks to a few accounting courses, I can pretty easily find my watch through reported balance sheets, income statements, etc. and have a good understanding of what to look for on these documents. BPY seems like a solid company, with international holdings, a strong investor backing and a forward yield of 6.82%. The only thing that seems to be a bit concerning to me is their assets-to-liabilities, which tells me they could face tight liquidity issues if they do not maintain their rental fees.

   Is this concerning enough to stay away, or is a this a good buy to hold for the future? Options I've looked at is Bank of America Corporation, Visa, Alteria Group, and others listed as dividend aristocrats, as well as quite a few REITS and MLP's.  Am I better of going with ONLY these guaranteed, proven winners, or should I feel confident with companies that pass my own analysis as well as diversify myself with these All-Stars?

   The platforms I've chosen are SimpleWealth Trade due to their commisionless service and IB for their history of being a cheap, trusted broker in Canada. I am using OptionsAlpha free, yahoo finance and finvis to supplement SimpleWealth's lack of analysis tools.

TL;DR: What the title says. I have $1000 CAD AKA Pond Scum, which stocks should I buy to start my dividend investing journey?

Thanks in advance for any answers, tips or wisdom!",2019-10-24,10,11

6ppzf7_AXP,AXP,Capital One ($COF) Analysis- issuiung subprime loans to stay afloat,"Preface: I am a college student at a semi-target school practicing my ability to analyze companies; I plan on doing these once a week or so. Any feedback/criticism is appreciated and encouraged. Anyways, here’s some free DD-

**Company Info:**

Capital One ($COF) is a financial holdings company operating under 3 sectors: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking.  Recently beating their 7/20 earnings by 3% (1.96 vs 1.90 expected), COF saw a nice 8% increase in their share price (1).  COH has a slew of competitors in their industry including (but not limited to): Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA) and American Express ($AXP) to name a few.

COF gains roughly 85% of their revenue from net interest while the rest comes from non-interest portions of the company.  COF has seen an 8% increase in net interest income from 2016 to 2017 (2).  COF’s commercial banking department saw a *317%* increase from 2016 (2016: 67; 2017: 213). However, their credit card department decreased from $609 to $271; I’ll expand on this later.

**Strength:**

To start off with some positives of COF, their net revenue increased by 3% this past year and they saw earnings increase by 6% as well (3).  As I mentioned earlier, COF also saw an astounding 317% increase in the commercial banking department.  This isn’t strongly reflected in their overall net income though, since they also took a *55%* hit in their credit card department cancelling it out.

COF isn’t as diversified as some of its competitors such as Visa.  As Visa mention in their 10k, if any increased regulations in the global payments industry can severely harm their business (25% of their revenue comes from international transactions)(5).  However, COF isn’t as exposed to the international market (only about 3%) shielding it from international policy changes.  In fact, if increased regulations were to come around it would present an opportunity for COF to gain ground on its competitors.

**Weakness**

In regards to their credit card department, COF actually reported $3,346 in net interest revenue (up from 3,033 in 2016; 10 percent increase).  So if they had a 10% increase in revenue why did the net income for the department drop by 50%?  The answer is they allocated $700 more dollars to “provisions for credit loss” (PCL) (2).  As a reference point, they increased their PCL from 1,071 to 1,717 from 2016.  This signifies a 60% increase in coverage while their net income only increased by 10%?  Seems a little absurd.

In their 10-k, they explain the increase in PCL is:

*  “due to increasing loss expectations” (page 12)(2).

* “higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to seasoning of recent growth” (page 11)(2)

For those who don’t know, a charge-off is a declaration by the creditor that the debt is unlikely to be collected (4).  What this reads to me as is that COF is relying on issuing riskier debts to maintain growth in their credit card department.  In the short term, this will inflate their net income for the department and perhaps even see continued net-interest growth in the short term since the interest rates on these will be higher than average.  However, when they fail since people (unsurprisingly, in this case) can’t pay it off COF will have to take the loss.

 Now, this is what they accounted for by allocating $700 more to PCL.  This should send up red flags, since they don’t disclose how heavily involved they are with these loans and use generic terms when referring to it.  Is a $700 increase enough to accommodate for all of risk they’ve taken on with these loans?  What kind of financial position is COF in that they resort to making unfavorable and unsustainable lending decisions and still take a 55% hit to their credit card departments net income?

They are one of the top 3 companies exposed to subprime auto-loan lending (7), which is frightening because automobiles are already one of the fastest depreciating assets by dropping a significant amount in value as soon as you drive it out of the lot.  WIth default rates already on the rise (7), how long will it be before COF is left bag-holding worthless loans?

**Opportunity:**

If COF’s 317% increase in their commercial banking department continues into next year, the upside potential is huge.  This is COF’s fastest growing department, and with an increased focus on it in this bull market it’ll be interesting to see just how much it can grow.  COF mentions it’s plans to open up larger investments and acquisitions in its technology infrastructure (page 19)(2).  This can have a large upside potential change for COF, as investing in technological infrastructure for the company has panned out well for a lot of companies.

It’s also impossible for their credit card department to take another hit like they did this year to it’s net income (from 609 to 271, would literally wipe out this department) so those losses won’t be dragging down COF’s overall net income.

**Threat:**

As I mentioned earlier, COF’s credit card department has been issuing a (much) higher percentage of riskier loans.  If something were to cause a larger-than-expected amount of the debtors to default on the loans (whether it’s the recession we’re long overdue for, rising interest rates or any number of things) COF can be in a lot of trouble.  COF is set up for another year in decreasing credit card net income, as it’s unsustainable practices of issuing riskier loans.

On a similar note, if charge-offs and PCL continue to increase again like they did this last year then COF can be caught in a sticky situation with decreased growth in ⅔ of it’s departments and even less revenue.

Any increased regulations on the domestic (U.S.) payment industry will impact COF more so than the majority of its competitors (such as Visa).  This is because COF’s business is primarily focused in the U.S. with only around 3% of their revenues coming from international transactions (2).

*Ratio Comparisons (6)*

P/E: COF 12.7		V 29.1

* COF’s P/E has seen a slight increase from its previous years value of 10.2.  This is as expected though since they did have decreased revenue.  V’s P/E is also up from its last years value of 29.1, around the same difference as COF.  If you look across the consumer financial sector, 12.7 is an attractive P/E to have making this a good sign for COF.

P/B: COF 0.9		V 4.7

* A P/B of 0.9 is exceptional, even for a sector know for their low P/B’s.  A P/B below 1 means they are trading for less than their book values indicate.  This can be both good or bad depending on the company.  In this scenario, I’m not a fan of it simply because of how their credit card department is performing, and this low P/B reflects that something is potentially fundamentally wrong with the company.  However,  if COF is able to grow and recover this next quarter there’s a lot of upside potential when the P/B will inevitably be corrected.

Med. Operating Profit Margin:  COF 25.1		V 60.6

* What operating margin tells us is the amount of leftover revenue after operations.  Typically, you want to see a higher OPM because that means you’re making more money per sale. I don’t like COF’s relatively low OPM, especially with their declining growth in one of their 3 main departments (credit card).  They’ll have to make 2 sales for every 1 that Visa does, just to stay even.

Return on Equity:  COF 8.3		V 26.26

* Return on Equity is important because it tells us how much profit a company generates from shareholder’s money.  A low ROE, such as COF’s 8.3 (generally anything below 10% is unfavorable) isn’t a great sign.  This means they will need 3x the amount of capital investments to get the same return as Visa.

Dividend Yield:  COF 1.8		V .7

* For anyone who doesn’t know, dividend yield is measures how much dividends are being paid out (based on share price).  A higher DY is preferable, and COF has a good DY for their sector.  This is what I like about COF, they have a nice dividend yield.  They are continuing to invest back into themselves by expanding their technology infrastructure while also issuing some dividends for the shareholders.  It’s the best of both worlds.

Conclusion:

* On paper, COF looks like a good company in their sector.  With low P/E, low P/B and a relatively high DY it can be an attractive company.  That being said, I don’t foresee COF having a strong future outlook.  With the increase in risky loans being given out in their credit card department and still underperforming, COF puts itself in a poor position.  With subprime-auto loans on the rise and COF being one of the 3 most exposed (7), I can easily see COF taking on a lot of water when people default on their loans.  With the way things are heading, they will need another 300% increase in their commercial banking department, which will be hard to match especially if anything were to come about to hinder it (as I mentioned earlier with a recession, ect.).  Obligatory ""I have no position in this company, nor do I intend to open one any time soon"".

The reduction follows a rare shareholder revolt last year when 59% voted against Dudley's 2015 pay and benefits package worth $19.6 million.
Shareholders protested his pay getting bumped up 20% despite a weaker performance by BP in 2015, when it reported an annual loss of $5.2 billion and its share price slumped. Dudley still got his money since the vote wasn't binding.
The company said it has overhauled its executive pay policies since then, and the changes will be put to a binding vote of shareholders.",2017-04-06,252,21

Several redditors have noticed a sharp rise in BP's stock since Brexit! Does that matter? Given the dollar nature of the oil business, I doubt it, though a $ sales £ costs business is on the right side of the Brexit trade.

In fact for me the key question I'd like answered is around dividend sustainability.

# Description
BP p.l.c. is an integrated oil and gas company. No much more to say! Though worth noting that the company owns 20% of Rosneft one of the largest oil companies in Russia.

## Recent financials 

Anything but exciting both in terms of sales and profitability.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $223bn | $354bn | $379bn | $376bn | $376bn|
|EPS | -$0.35 | $0.20 | $1.23 | $0.58 | $1.32|

But to put that in perspective here's Exxon's latest figures. Rather a lot more impressive, really.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $259bn | $394bn | $421bn | $452bn | $467bn|
|EPS | $3.85 | $7.60 | $7.37 | $9.70 | $8.42|

## Competition
BP is mute on competition in its SEC 20K so here's the commentary of Exxon

> The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. 

So not only are BP, XOM and the boys at each others throats, they've got to worry about solar, nuclear, etc.

Looking at it's size, last 12 months, things are still in reverse. Margins are at the bottom of the pack and returns negative. Generally a poor comparison to the other majors.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
BP plc (ADR) | $207,210M | 8% | -ve
Chevron Corporation | $120,308M | 14% | 1%
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (ADR) | $292,238M | 8% | 5%
Eni SpA (ADR) | $66,433M | 16% | -ve
Exxon Mobil Corporation | $241,835M | 11% | 8%
PetroChina Company Limited (ADR) | $300,042M | 15% | 5%
Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) | $247,808M | 11% | -ve
Total SA (ADR) | $133,980M | 20% | 4%

BP plc (ADR) has $30,815M of net debt. That is 1.8x it's latest operating profit. Nothing hideous... but watch out, dividends are higher than earnings, so with debts of $31bn can they really sustain a higher divie that profits?

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $35.56 for BP plc (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of -1% to their target. So rather a mockery of the idea of price targets. 

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. With earnings this high, I can't but feel that the current EPS isn't a good reflection of future cashflows. So *boring* large cash cows like oils, who are cutting cutting on capex and just pumping what they've got, the EPS looks depressed. And the FCF yields look a lot more reasonable, as a result.

Though again, Wall Street's hardly showering itself in glory maintaining double digit long-term growth forecasts for many of the majors.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/bp/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
BP | $110,793M | 29x | 23% | 7% | 10%
CVX | $197,460M | 87x | 40% | 4% | 16%
SNP | $85,606M | 14x | 2% | 4% | 31%
E | $58,276M | 13x | N/A | 4% | 5%
XOM | $387,874M | 34x | 27% | 3% | 11%
PTR | $189,739M | 29x | 41% | 1% | N/A
RDSA | $221,207M | 23x | 20% | 7% | 28%
TOT | $118,064M | 15x | -3% | 5% | 24%

# Dividends
BP plc (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.34 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.80 per share. That is a 30% growth. But way above the current forecast of an EPS of $1.23. Worries me that.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 19% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 26%. So the performance has all been driven by earnings upgrades. So it's all about their ability to:
* ride the oil price
* show they are aggressively cutting capex
* give comfort that their 7% divie is sustainable 

Anything else that could boost it? Or trash it?

44bry4_SQ,SQ,Long HBP Write Up,"**Business Description**

Huttig Building Products, Inc. [NASDAQ: HBP] (“Huttig” or the “Company”) is an 81.6mn market cap U.S. housing supply company headquarted in St. Louis, Missouri. Huttig has a rich corporate history dating back to 1885, and over the years have positioned themselves as a dominant middleman between product manufactures and their customers in the local markets they service.

 Through its distribution centers, Huttig supplies millwork and building products (88% of revenue) (doors, windows, stair components, and molding) used in residential construction and remodeling and wood products (12% of revenue) (flooring systems, panels, and lumber) to an established network of specialty dealers and general retailers.

Huttig’s value add is two-fold. Their national distribution footprint provides the Company with economies of scale that offer customers access to a broader range of inventory than they normally would have access to at a more attractive price than what a manufacturer would charge, as well as next-day delivery on orders. Additionally, Huttig performs post-purchase processing on products to job-specific configurations needed by end customers, something that manufacturers with standardized SKUs are often not able to perform. 


**Investment Thesis**

* HBP will compound at a double digit rate over the next 5 years, driven by (1) bottom-line margin expansion from 0.4% to 1.3%, (2) cash margin expansion from 0.3% to 2.5%, and (3) increased analyst coverage and street visibility with upcoming management change.
* Bottom-line margin expansion will be driven by (1) 4-6% top-line growth as HBP’s serviceable market grows faster than the market is expecting, and (2) incremental cost savings as top-line growth outpaces growth in fixed variable fuel and wage expenses.

* Cash margin expansion will be driven by (1) unlocking of $107mn worth of net operating loss carry-forwards (NOLs) that the market has not recognized, (2) NOL contribution of an average $14.6mn to free cash flow over the next 5 years.

* Recruitment of a new CFO is focused on identifying candidates with extensive M&A and investor relations experience; street visibility will be considerably increased once a qualified CFO has been recruited along with a free option on any future accretive M&A. 

**Valuation**

I value HBP on 2017 FCF. HBP trades at 7.0x FCF, and I conservatively assume this multiple in my methodology to arrive at the Company’s various valuation scenarios despite the higher comps average. A DCF valuation of HBP also yields similar results to my P/FCF valuation.

My valuation yields a base price target of $5.09, 55.1% upside to current price. Bull case price target of $5.96, 81.7% upside to current price. My bear case price target of $3.01, -8.2% downside to current price. I believe my valuation scenarios result in an asymmetric risk/reward profile for the Company.

BP said it would cut 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017 on top of 4,000 cuts already announced in oil and gas production as part of a $2.5 billion restructuring program announced last year.

""We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.

Fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, BP's definition of net income, came in at $196 million, significantly lower than analysts' expectations of $730 million.

Fourth-quarter impairments reached $2.6 billion as its oil and gas production division was hit by weak energy prices, including fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Utica shale acreage in Ohio and Libya.

dfnlt_BP,BP,Whats your oppinion about BP stock?,"So I bought yesterday and managed to time it in the dip. (I bought at 37.65 and it closed at 38)

I was thinking about selling before closing time but im hoping the news that the leak is permanantly sealed this weekend will make the stock rise on monday. Im not sure if it at all will have an impact. But heres to hoping.

It does feel a bit like holding a handgrenade and not being entirely sure if the pin is in it or not.The delay on the Q3 results is a bit alarming.

What is the expected outcome of that anyway? If it's gonna be better than expected why delay it? 

As a long term investment I think it should be good. It feels like it's just a too big a company to fail.",2010-09-18,8,14
