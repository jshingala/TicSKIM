163109z_CCI,CCI,AMT vs CCI," 

Thoughts on future growth for these two communication tower REITs. CCI has the (much) higher yield but with AMT I'm drawn to their exposure in emerging markets and the data center sector. I'm fine with a lower div yield if there is a bigger upside.  

40 years old and doing my best to strike a balance building a diversified dividend income and growth portfolio. I also have positions in O, WPC, and VICI.

lvnd2s_CCI,CCI,"Is an Informative Sell a really bad sign? For example, one on 2/25 seems to have tanked my CCI shares; I'm currently still holding, but...","CCI is the only red in a sea of green for the day in my portfolio, and given that I intended this stock to be a relatively safe, long-term dividend-granting purchase, that has me a little worried. I couldn't find the catalyst for quite a while, as live news coverage is sparse on this stock, but after enough digging I found that an insider has done something called an Informative Sell, which is apparently different from an Uninformative Sell in that it is effectively a vote of no confidence in the company. Combined with the earlier market downturn I think this is the reason the stock isn't climbing back up, and indeed, is slowly bleeding a little further. 

That being said, there have also been 2 Informative Buys in the last 4 months, though looking back even further (7+ months) the rest are Sells, as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/1C0sCnV.png). 

My question is: How significant is this, in terms of both share price and future dividend returns?

I meant this to be a long-hold dividend stock, with the 5G prospects just being a bonus, and thus as long as I get paid for the next 15-20 years the share price fluctuations don't matter as much to me. The worry is that this might signal an even worse decline and endanger even my dividends later on! 

I am a new investor (only started around the whole GameStop fiasco), so I don't have much experience with this kind of thing. For some context, here's a pie chart of my [portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/fjOYQjU.png); as you can see, CCI is only 4.41%, so even if this is terrible news, going down with the ship won't financially ruin me or anything. I just want to make sure this isn't some neon sign I am oblivious to seeing. 

What do you think? Thank you for your time and feedback!",2021-03-01,5,5
iz6mn1_CCI,CCI,RSI vs CCI - which is better and why?,"What are pros and cons of each of them? I'm recently falling in love with CCI (MTF version), because it is unbound unlike RSI and therefore produces some unbiased reversal hints.

For example:

1. CCI-MTF seems to be faster than RSI-MTF. It means that CCI-MTF reaches hidden divergence areas faster than RSI-MTF. I'm not sure why.

2. When you see something that looks like a breakout, especially reversing previous trend, but CCI-MTF didn't reach +100 or -100, then it was too weak and probably was just a fakeout.

8p90kt_CCI,CCI,Tradingview's CCI is different my own calculation,"I try to calculate CCI (Commodity Channel Index) indicator on my own excel sheet. I used binance BTC/USDT data. I calculated the CCI according to Tradingview's wiki page. But my results is very different from Tradingview's chart.

My excel is here:

6pe6nn_CCI,CCI,"Cell and wireless tower REIT, Crown Castle, sees growth boosted by rising connectivity. Valuation looks inexpensive with yield of 3.83%.","Wireless tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) has seen its performance boosted by the increasing number of carriers offering unlimited data to customers while increasing connectivity generally looks set to boost demand for the foreseeable future.

Q2 results last week showed no let up in growth with revenues up 8%, net income up 30% and adjusted funds fom operations (AFFO) rising 12%.  Additionally the company raised guidance with AFFO now to increase 13% to $1.82bn.

With a market cap of $36.3bn that puts the valuation on a multiple of 20x AFFO with a yield of 3.83%.  Not bad for a REIT with significant growth prospects.

The cell tower business continues to benefit frowm increasing connectivity with smart phones and unlimited data plans being the main drivers.  While the rate of user growth is now slowing in the US it is still expected to increase by 20% by 2021.  However, overall the mobile data requirement is expected to increase four fold over the same period.

CCI also reported the acquisition of Lightower which will boost AFFO by a further c.$400 million and increase the fiber network footprint significantly in preparation for the roll out of next generation 5G wireless technology.

Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer, summed it all up quite nicely at the call;

""We had another terrific quarter exceeding our previously provided Outlook for net income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term positive fundamentals for mobile data demand growth with our leading portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure across towers and small cells.  As the wireless carriers turn to our infrastructure to improve and enhance their networks to meet what is expected to be a four-fold increase in mobile data demand by 2021, we believe there is a sustained runway of organic growth opportunities on our existing portfolio as well as opportunities for us to make accretive investments that enhance our long-term growth profile.""
