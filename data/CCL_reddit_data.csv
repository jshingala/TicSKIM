Some might call it reckless, others might call it visionary—I call it “boarding the rocket ship or going down with the ship.”

Here’s the play:
	•1700 shares locked and loaded.
	•Carnival is floating at a disgustingly low price, and I’m betting on a post-pandemic cruise boom. People are itching to travel, and floating buffets on the ocean are back in style.
	•Debt? Yeah, they got some. But you know who else had debt? America, and we’re still here.
	•I’m either sipping piña coladas on the Lido deck or learning to paddle real fast.

I’ve seen people YOLO on meme stocks, crypto tokens named after dogs, and even orange juice futures. I figure a floating casino on the ocean is as good a bet as any.

I’m holding until I either get free cruise perks for life or my portfolio ends up in Davy Jones’ locker. Let’s set sail, boys.

TL;DR: YOLO’d everything into $CCL. I’m either cruising with the whales or swimming with the minnows. See you on the Lido deck or at the soup kitchen.",2025-05-16,75,32

At this point I’m thinking it’s not going to go any higher. Would it be smarter to just sell and reinvest in an s&p?? My total market value is about $1,600. I was hoping it would go back close to its high of $70 a share but I am losing faith in it. ",2025-01-20,4,6
1hcfg3j_CCL,CCL,Thoughts on CCL and cruise stocks?,"I've been buying in since it was about $14 or so. I understood the risk with the massive debt but they seem to be paying it off and booking to capacity, consecutive earnings beats, and cheaper oil.

I really like this stock but I've been enjoying the recent rise up after getting in close to the bottom.

It seems that cruises aren't just for old retirees but many young people are doing it now. 

Just looking for anything to be aware of outside of say, significant oil increases, reversal of ability to pay down COVID financing/debt, decreased bookings, pandemic, etc.

1fszucu_CCL,CCL,Carnival Stock Slips After Record-Setting Quarter Offset by Weak Outlook,"[Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/carnival-record-setting-quarter-offset-by-weak-outlook-update-8720379); CCL was down much lower earlier, but is now at -2.75%.

The outlook portion that is bringing down CCL stock:

> Carnival anticipates net yields growing by approximately 5.0% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and by about 10.4% for the full year. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for 5.76% and 10.52%, respectively. Net yield measures revenue per available passenger cruise day, after deducting expenses like airfare, commissions, and other direct costs.

Some other info on the earnings [from street insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Earnings/Carnival+Corp.+%28CCL%29+Tops+Q3+EPS+by+10c/23778490.html):

Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) reported Q3 EPS of $1.27, $0.10 better than the analyst estimate of $1.17. Revenue for the quarter came in at $7.89 billion versus the consensus estimate of $7.82 billion.

2024 Outlook

For the full year 2024, the company expects:

* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 10.4 percent compared to 2023, better than June guidance, based on continued strength in demand.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 3.5 percent compared to 2023, approximately 1 percentage point better than June guidance driven by cost saving opportunities, accelerated easing of inflationary pressures and benefits from one-time items.
* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $6.0 billion, up over 40 percent compared to 2023 and better than June guidance by nearly $200 million.
* Adjusted return on invested capital (""ROIC"") of approximately 10.5 percent, an improvement of approximately 5.0 percentage points compared to 2023 and half a point better than June guidance.
* For the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects:
* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 5.0 percent compared to particularly strong 2023 levels.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 8.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher dry-dock days and higher investment in advertising.
* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.14 billion, up 20 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

1e2ctt4_CCL,CCL,Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL),"Disclaimer: This is only my personal opinion. It should not be taken as professional advice to take any financial actions. My ideas and/or experiences could be wrong (and sometimes they will certainly be). You would do good if you consult an professional advisor before make movements in risky financial markets.

Hello, this is why I think Carnival Corp. (CCL) is a great buy right now.

STRENGTHS:
-Net earning growth before COVID-19 has been really good, around 20.88% per year (2014-2019).
-Its costs has not raised so much, only 6.36% per year (2014-2023) or 3.9% if you exclude post-COVID period when the highest increase took place (2020-2023). Even this, prices in market are the same as 2020 levels.
-Net earnings are starting to growth again, from -10.23 Billions (2020) and, -9.5B (2021), to -6.09B (2022) and, -0.074B (2023). The trend is turning positive for Carnival.
-It is leading its industry, Carnival has a really big share in the market and it revenue is bigger.
-Its international market and varity of brands is a plus to attract and retain different kind of customers. Its number of customers every year is stable, which means there is a good base to build upon.
-Carnival has been in the business for more than 50 years, they know what to do with cruises.
-The sector will be profitable some years more (I think between 5-10 at least), there are no more alternatives to replace cruises (do not get me wrong, I know they face competence from hotels and parks, but the most effective way to take vacations on sea is a cruise, I am not aware of other inventions or technologies which can replace them in the short run). Futhermore, the sector is recovering the pre-COVID levels.
-Many directors and executives have invested in the company, so, they have incentives to do the job right.

RISKS:
-Debt is huge, its debt equity ratio is 613% (2023), and double than revenue (42.23B in debt versus 21.59B in revenue).
-Politics, specially environmental ones, Carnival has had some problems for its practices related to contamination. Even more, some cities are considering stop receiving cruises, among other reasons (as the high volume of people invading local towns every year), the environmental contamination.
-If they were willing to fake their environmental records (a reason why they faced some lawsuits), how do we know they are not doing the same with earning records?
-Even when other big cruises companies have a lot debt, Carnival is not better, then, it could be surpassed by the competence.

So, why do I think is a great buy? Beside debt, they have had to face all other risks along time and they have made it very good. And the most serious risk right know, I mean debt, it is not a result from company itself but an external force as COVID, in other words, a temporary situation which is over, they are showing some recovery despite of the fact the price per share has not gone up in years.

Let me put some maths on it, if we suppose they make 1B in net profit for 5 years (yeah, I am supposing there is no grothw), and add 24.44B (book value they already has), that total 29.55B. The current market value is 22.85B (or 18.22 per share). I mean, come on, debt is big, but this is too much crazy, net profits in 2014 were 1.23B, and pre-COVID level net profit were 3.15B (2018) and 2.99B (2019).

Although its current debt is high, even if we suppose they take 6 years to recover pre-COVID levels (around 3.05B in net profits), and I think they are going to achieve it in less time, pay 1/3 of its debt in that period (which would be around 14.07B), and average earning growth is as low as 6% in a 10 years period (and remember the pre-COVID growth was 20.88%), you would still make a profit in the long run.

According to my logic:

(3.05×(1.06^4 −1)÷0.06)+24.44 = 37.78

37.78 - 14.07 = 23.71

Where 3.05B is pre-COVID net profit.
1.06 is 6% growth.
24.44B is current book value.
14.07 is 1/3 of debt.

In this case, 23.71B is still more than the current market value at 22.85B, with a left debt around 28.16B (2020 debt was 33.02B). Plus, I am sure some of you realized I am not counting in this ecuation the first 6 years earnings.

So, this is my conclusion, Carnival Corporation's debt is very big, but the discount in the market right now is even bigger. Given that the debt is a product of COVID, and I hope there is not going to be a similar situation of that magnitude in the next years, Carnival is a buy choice.",2024-07-13,10,20

1dn54ye_CCL,CCL,Thoughts on CCL,"I love the cruise line itself, it's a great fun vacation and a lot cheaper than most vacations, of the cruise lines they do kind of have sort of a bad reputation, but in my opinion their more lax environment makes it more relaxing than being around the class of people on the other cruise lines that can get kinda snobby.

Seine COVID they have been reducing debt as well as acquiring a bigger fleet positioning them in a good spot if rates don't change and a great spot if rates go down.

Their last earnings showed a positive trajectory and most analysts expect another great earnings report this week, they took a hit with BofA said they expect lower prices this summer for cruise lines lowering the price a bit positioning as a great buy in my opinion 

They recorded $7 billion in deposits for the first quarter of 2024 and with bookings at 102% occupancy compared to just 54% occupancy in Q1 of 2022

I think they might have a great earnings call and have a very positive run

Carnival Launches $531.4 Million Senior Notes Offering

Carnival ($CCL, $CUK) said Tuesday that it has launched a private offering of 500 million euros ($531.4 million) of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2030.

The cruise operator said it will use the net proceeds, along with existing cash, to redeem its 500 million euros 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2026 at a redemption price equal to 101.9% of the notes' principal amount plus interest. Carnival said it has already issued a conditional notice of redemption for the notes, to be redeemed by April 26.

As part of its ongoing debt reduction measures, Carnival said it also expects to start the marketing of a repricing transaction for its $2.3 billion first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2028 and $1.3 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2027. The company said it expects to make up to $800 million partial prepayments of the outstanding amounts under the facilities.

1bwmn4k_CCL,CCL,Food for thought - CCL - 5/17 $16c,"You’re probably wondering why I’ve gathered you all here today. 

CCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B

Around 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.

In 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.

CCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. 

RCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. 



-CON-
CCL’s long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. 

-HOWEVER-

During last quarter CCL’s operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. 

CCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, “Our responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders”

For the full year 2024, Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) expects net yields (in constant currency) to increase approximately 9.5% compared to 2023, which is more than a point better than their December guidance, based on continued strength in demand and with occupancy at historical levels. Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel (in constant currency) are anticipated to be $35 million better than December guidance, with adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) (in constant currency) being 0.5 percentage points higher than December guidance due to lower ALBDs from the Red Sea rerouting as certain ships reposition without guests. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $5.63 billion, representing over 30% growth compared to 2023 and better than December guidance despite the impact of the Red Sea rerouting of approximately $130 million or $0.09 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) through November 2024​​.

For the second quarter of 2024, CCL anticipates net yields (in constant currency) to be up approximately 10.5% compared to 2023 levels, including the unfavorable impact from the Red Sea rerouting of 0.5 percentage points, with occupancy at historical levels. Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) are expected to increase approximately 3.0% compared to the second quarter of 2023, including the unfavorable impact of 1.3 percentage points as a result of lower ALBDs from the Red Sea rerouting as certain ships reposition without guests. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be approximately $1.05 billion, over 50% growth compared to the second quarter of 2023​​.

 

Guidance provided by Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) indicates expectations of growth through the second quarter of 2024 and beyond. Specifically, the company has raised its full-year 2024 net yield guidance (in constant currency) to approximately 9.5% compared to 2023, signaling anticipated revenue growth. This adjustment is based on continued strength in demand and with occupancy levels at historical highs. Additionally, for the second quarter of 2024, CCL expects net yields (in constant currency) to be up approximately 10.5% compared to 2023 levels, despite the unfavorable impact of certain operational adjustments.

The company's optimism extends into the future as they have begun focusing more on delivering an even stronger 2025, suggesting confidence in sustained growth and operational improvements beyond the current fiscal year. This outlook is underpinned by record booking levels, strong demand across its brands, and strategic operational decisions, including fleet expansion and sustainability initiatives​​.",2024-03-27,23,62
1bojwfv_CCL,CCL,Carnival Corporation and Place Stock (CCL) - Earnings Tomorrow!,"**Context:**

I was using the stock screener for aggressive growth stocks by setting filters to 50%+ YoY Growth in Revenue and stumbled across Carnival. With earnings coming tomorrow I thought I would do a quick write up.

**Thesis:**

CCL was hit hard during 2020 when their entire operations shut down due to covid. They had to fork out a massive $30B debt raising concerns over their future. Stocks plummeted to new lows to $8-9  a share. Over the past year the share price has doubled back to $17 a share as we see revenues return to new records. Provided that Carnival can improve cash flows, pay down debt and increase revenues we can see a rebound back to the 30-60 range where it was trading prior to 2021.

**The Bull Case:**

**#1** Increasing customer demand for Carnival

&#x200B;

[\(c\) Percentages in excess of 100&#37; indicate that on average more than 2 passengers occupied some cabins.](https://preview.redd.it/26qxztngxqqc1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=5eadf308c75300e31380217ac71caff41c192851)

We can see the number of customers has been increasing over the last 3 years and the occupancy percentage has been steadily rising. The question is can they push this beyond 100%? This is certainly a positive sign which has been reflected in CCL’s rising revenues.

**#2** Record high revenues

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p7fqosdqpqqc1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5bc5848d7e55717d36ad8e29b574eaa4eed2eb0

They have now rebounded swiftly to $21.6B revenue (new records) since 2021.

**#3** Paying Down Debt

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cmcsbhstpqqc1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=934a311a4aede256c86175ea34d61610ad6c333c

11.8% of Long Term Debt Debt paid (They are addressing this issue using cash reserves). They have just turned FCF positive ($1.34B) in 2023 which is a positive sign (things are going in the right direction).

&#x200B;

**#4**  Carnival is the largest cruise company by revenue $21.6B and has a significant moat within the cruise industry. The outlook for CCL doesn't look as bleak as it appears to be, they can turn this around provided they deal with the challenges as mentioned below.

&#x200B;

**Challenges:**

**#1** Balance sheet (high amounts of debt)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2pbo5h25qqqc1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae7a6b183422676012e1c34505c8a4173b2ca25e

The debt maturity increases dramatically in 2027 and this is where CCL will struggle.

**What they need to do:**

* Increase Free Cash Flow and Pay Down Debt.  
In 2023 Free Cash Flow was only 1.337 Billion, half of what they were producing during pre-covid. They need to increase the price of their tickets and services and look into cutting costs where they can without diminishing quality too harshly.
* Restructure some of their debt (particularly 2027+ debt where the loans they took out had high interest rates). They need to clear some of this off by taking low interest debts or debt with longer maturities.
* Expand their services and increase customer services to drive revenue to operate at greater capacity.

During the 2 years to come, CCL is able to pay off their debt in 2025 and 2026 which may cause some upside potential as their debt levels come down.

**#2** Unattractive comparisons

Let's look at CCL's biggest competitor: Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. They have rebounded back to 52 weeks high, let's look why they look much more attractive from a financial point of view.

https://preview.redd.it/qhhrpux5tqqc1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce287595751d949a282a612224f37325a1086dc

We can see RCL is doing better than CCL, this is what they need to do. (Increase revenues, improve margins and pay down debt) and consequently the market has rebounded positively for RCL.

&#x200B;

**#3** Rising Cost of Operating Expenses

https://preview.redd.it/x569i49gwqqc1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d844c86aa5bce467f913f2edd87eced4659d557

Food, commissions and onboard costs are where we are seeing the biggest increases. They need to focus on these areas and try to cut costs without affecting quality drastically as well as increasing prices. These rising costs of goods are really cutting into Carnival's margins and this needs to be addressed.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, Carnival has shown significant resilience in bouncing back from the challenges posed by the pandemic. With a notable increase in revenue and a positive trajectory towards paying down debt, CCL is positioned for potential growth. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding the large debt burden and rising costs of revenue. To sustain momentum and unlock further upside potential, CCL must focus on increasing free cash flow, optimising its balance sheet through strategic debt restructuring, and enhancing operational efficiency without compromising on quality. As long as Carnival continues to execute on these strategies while avoiding further unprecedented disruptions, there exists potential for shareholders to benefit from the company's recovery journey.",2024-03-26,16,11

1b0suj5_CCL,CCL,YOLO Carnival Cruise CCL," Carnival Cruise is a Covid recovery play. They go hit hard but now there are record numbers with bookings and prices. Try to find a cruise they are expensive and booked. Every earnings CCL beat. This maintains the same with the entire sector. Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise. All beating earnings. T

The forecast for the sector is is amazing with higher then expected bookings with increased rates. All players in the sector are forecasting the same thing through out the year. I have complete conviction in this that it was just sold off and going to rocket at the earnings and happy to be in this position now

186tyoi_CCL,CCL,"Bullish on cruise line stocks? CCL, RCL, NCLH","I feel like it's been a little while since I've seen stock discussion regarding cruise lines in this sub. Cruise lines had record breaking bookings this quarter, beating estimates. Carnival (CCL) is up 80% YTD and Royal Caribbean (RCL) is up 109% YTD. A few analysts have recently upgraded from Hold to Buy. The one head scratcher to me is Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), only up 18% YTD.

I understand the argument is that during COVID, cruise lines accumulated ton of debt but in 2023 we have seen cut in debts as interest has risen. Carnival stated they have a 3-year plan to reduce debt with 3 ships coming in 2024, 1 ship in 2025 and 0 ships in 2026 it will allow them to use a ton of free cash flow to cut debts in the future. 

Other looming threats = fuel pricing from war and other factors.   
\- Carnival is focusing on reducing fuel usage, with having a 16% reduction in unit consumption of fuel in 2023.

Pre-covid, CCL was sitting around $50 and now is trading under $15. RCL was at $135, now at $106. NCLH was at $59, now under $15 as well.

I think I'm the most bullish on Carnival as a long-term buy/hold, as I like the direction CEO Josh Weinstein is taking the company.

rqrytv_CCL,CCL,Rate My CCL Strat,"Basically title, with reasonings here.

Obviously down a lot due to covid fear and variants. Way below where it was prior to covid (even taking into account all the shares they sold, market cap is still well below that point. The equivalent to CCL's 50$ price prior to covid would be about 35$ now.

Despite variant news, forward bookings and for the second half of 2022 and 2023 look very strong, like better than pre COVID strong.  Even without all cruise ships going, the ones that ARE are seeing record on-board spending. (To be fair, pre COVID on board spending usually grew year over year already, but I would still consider the fact that it's not losing that trend a good sign)

Debts are still pretty high, in the billions, but refinancing is going well, shy of cancellations in the second half of 2022 they should be cash flow positive by then, and they've got plenty of cash on hand in case of emergencies, so they're in no danger of defaulting on loans or anything.

As for how I'm thinking of playing it:

Established in the last year or so, a couple patterns show up:

Strong floor in the 16-17 range, strong ceiling at 30-31.
Weaker floor/ceiling(depends on direction) at 20 and 25.

Plan is to buy in at the approximately 20~ dollar range, sell at approximately 25~ and repeat as it ranges between these areas.

Due to the volatility it's shown so far, and events like omicron continuing, I think within the next year I could have the opportunity to repeat this a good few times. At least two, maybe three, at 25% each.

Biggest hurdles:

Entry and exit timing. As I mentioned, my range is 20-25, but that's not an exact science.  I'm hoping I can use technicals to get a good feel for when things are turning around, but I'll be real I've been pretty dog shit at that so far, so I'm probably safer just sticking to buying and selling at 20 and 25, but we'll see how well I stick to that.

Unforeseen COVID events. (Gamma variant? Are we past that yet?) Variant news during an upswing can obviously cause problems. (Actually entered at 20 just before omicron, feels bad. Already in the green above twenty again but missing that 16-20 range hurts bad.). This is another ""hopefully I can get a feel for how things are going"" type problem, which isn't a great answer.  Thought here is during variant issues is to widen the range to the lower support at ~16.  That support has held pretty well through both delta and omicron now, so if I catch word of another I'd probably bow out, see how it tests those supports, then buy back in.  

Unforeseen COVID events can also be positive I think, (positive vaccine news, improved vax rates, less new cases) that could potentially push above 25. In this case would be the reverse of the above. Try to let it ride up to thirty.


Think that's it! Any thoughts? I'm mostly worried there's some other grand source of risk that I'm not thinking of. Part of me thinks it's also a lot of effort when I could get lucky with a growth stock and get like triple that gain, but I'm pretty bad at picking and timing those so this feels weirdly a bit safer for me. (I have a PLAN, at least. Rather than just... NIO ev go burr?)",2021-12-28,2,18

Before the pandemic, UAL was around 90 and is now 47, and after about 3-4 (I hope) months, it will go back to 90. Same goes for CCL, being 47 pre-COVID, and now being 21.  This is the lowest these companies suffering due to pandemic are going to get and from now it's going to double in the next couple of months after recovery with everyone getting vaccines and restrictions being lowered.

oouu77_CCL,CCL,CCL breakout is real,"If you look out the cruise industry pre pandemic you will notice that people were paying for experiences more than they were buying $200 pairs of Nike shoes. Bookings were going up every single year before the pandemic. Now if you look at c c l the bookings for the next cruises have sold out in 6 hours. The CEO Donald Arnold has told people that the bookings exceeded any prior year ever. The CDC will lift restricted sale orders and only put a temporary halt to lifting the restrictions while one judge actually dissented and wanted to lift the restrictions. We are so close. People who are vaccinated will go cruising people who are unvaccinated will also go cruising because they don't care and they think they won't get sick or it will be very mild. If you think that buying the airlines will give you the same response you're wrong. Business travel will always be down by approximately 20% and all Airlines however business travel will have nothing to do with the cruise ships they will benefit even more. Look at what Donald Arnold the CEO said he stated that cruising will come back explosive more than it ever has and that 75% of his ships will be Sailing by the end of this year. He has slimmed down the cruise ships by selling the old and tired ones and profits will be better. He has also purchased extreme luxury cruises that are absolutely stunning and with more millionaires in this world they will be the big Target and they have no problems with going on cruises and spending their money's. They also have natural gas Cruises so they can reduce the carbon footpront and this will also attract those people who are more green friendly. If America adopts with France did, requiring and vaccinations passport, then those people who are unvaccinated will be rushing to get vaccinated like they are doing as we speak in France. That again will cause the CDC to lift all restrictions and off we go. This is a no-brainer and money will rotate into this sector as they pull out from other sectors which they are doing also as we speak.",2021-07-21,5,4

CCL increased 25% to $26.69 and I lost my shares. No biggie, lost out on $300 but I had been holding these since the summer and had a nice profit. 

Last week I open my IRA up to options where I have another 100 shares of CCL sitting. On 3/31 I sell a 4/16 CC at $30.50 strike, it's trading at $26.50 at the time. Now it's up 15% to friggin $30.42.

lptckn_CCL,CCL,$CCL - Carnival Corp 02/22/2021 Trade Recap.,"Alright I can finally do another one of these trade recaps as the mods were nice enough to revert their restrictions on images within posts. So here we are. 

$CCL gapped up from Friday's after hours session from 22.84 to 24.67, almost an 8% gap up. Pre-market activity was sluggish but around 8:30am volume increased enough to catch my eye for a trade once the market opens. The highest rally pre-market was up to 25.58. Market open, price dipped below VWAP and EMA's but ultimately corrected itself back above those key levels. 

From Pre-market high's, I was looking for a position long of the break of 25.50 again and hopefully a move up to 26.00. 

[1 Minute Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ygmkkg0822j61.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=4681d00e1857d8f21e226a084698f6800449d36e)

Was watching closely as price began to rally back up to the pre-market highs, couldn't quite make it, and found some support at the 9ema (Red) as volume was decreasing. Boom, increase in price, increase in volume, rejected at 25.50 for 3 minutes. Breakout of 25.50. I was in long at the price print of anything above the half dollar. **Position filled at 25.52 long.** Absolute confirmation was the print above $25.58 as that was the previous HOD and also PM high. Sure I could've waited until full confirmation but the Volume increase at the bounce off the EMA was enough for me to get in earlier than usual. 

&#x200B;

[1 Minute Chart](https://preview.redd.it/qgsg8ipz22j61.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b056695c40155ff5c06148370839e9ae6b3f263)

Got an immediate break of the half dollar with fairly decent momentum so I decided to take off only a fraction of my total position at the quarter dollar (25.75). Now complete user error and my mistake but as I went to take another partial for profits, I fat fingered and bought more at 25.81 instead of selling (Oooops). Don't harp on yourself for making mistakes, it happens. Just adapt to it and move on. I instantly cut those extra shares for a small loss and sold them at 25.76 for a measly 5 cent loss / share. 

Anyways, price kept chopping up and riding the 9 ema on the 1 minute so I just rode the wave. At the break above $26.00 I sold another partial of my total position (down to 50%) at 26.21 as it was looking fairly over-extended in my opinion and I wanted to thin out my position. At the same time, I could be wrong so I want to keep a few on deck to ride out if this thing wanted to take off. 

Price consolidated and traded sideways for a few minutes after it broke $26.00 but it was still trending with the EMA and kept testing $26.50 so I held the rest for a break, got the break, and sold the rest of my position at $26.75. Filled at 26.67.

[5 Minute Chart](https://preview.redd.it/utc1yi3t42j61.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e95bdffd62ba92ec632ac19e9d6b43f0c0da687)

Was it a home run? no. Was it overly complicated? Hell no. It's rather quite simple; and this is why i'm going over it, trading does not have to be complicated its simple price action. All I did was identify a significant supply zone and waited for the break upwards of said zone. Sure there's a little more to it like reading data streams (L2, T&S, DOM) but at the end of the day its quite simplistic. So don't overthink. 

You can also make mistakes and still make money, I made the mistake of fat-fingering the buy button instead of the sell (Partially because TWS order entry is quite shit to be honest and it reset after my first partial) but I also should've saw that mistake so partially the fault of my own too. The question of the matter is how do you react to mistakes. Adapt and overcome them. 

If it's burnt down to the absolute fundamentals of the trade, I played a breakout and played pivot points of half dollars, quarter dollars, and whole dollar levels. It's not rocket science. 

If there are any questions please feel free to ask away and I will try to answer them all.",2021-02-22,19,12

lnpqrp_CCL,CCL,NrdRage's Friday DD: The Bermuda Triangle and You - Eating tendies on a floating petri dish for fun and profit ($NCLH $CCL $RCL),"**UPDATE:  For anybody who is just now finding this DD, note that, since its posting, all the cruise liners have diluted and further issued shares, even though they didn't have to given their finances.  This, obviously, changes the thesis of the price targets on these equities.  It's up to you to decide to what end.**

&#x200B;

Happy Friday all, NrdRage here.   You might remember me from such hits as knowing exactly where each GME weekly was going to end up, getting people out of SNDL before it collapsed, and starting a $RIOT before it was cool, warning you to get out of PLTR at 39, amongst others.  Today I want to have a more...gentle...conversation with you.  Let's talk about cruise stonks.

&#x200B;

# Wayne's World Flashback Humming

Picture it:  It's 2020.  The air is crisp with winter in the air, you're blowing your student loans on the latest iPhone, and your parents have decided to spend some of your inheritance on a 10 day Caribbean cruise because they're tired of shoveling snow, and you ended up being their greatest disappointment, anyways so why should they leave you some money?  So you could go blow it all on some SPY FD puts?  Screw that.  Carnival ($CCL) was sitting at about $42 a share, $NCLH was at $52, $RCL at $115.  Everything in the world was in its place.

&#x200B;

Then mom and dad called you frantically to let you know that there was a bioattack upon the ship, originating somewhere around the shuffleboard area.  Everybody was dying and the army wasn't letting them off the ship.  They wanted to let you know that they loved you...but that they, too, had been buying SPY FD puts and had lost the rest of your inheritance and were waiting for the right time to tell you.  Things were looking really grim.

&#x200B;

As we all know, predictably, when the world shut down, the cruise stonks got positively crushed.  Turns out having $0 in revenue is bad for stonk price.  Who knew?  But should they stay there?  Is there no longer a business model for beyond-middle-aged white people that want to spend a couple of weeks pretending they're ""alive"" as they partake in an entirely on-the-rails kiddie bumper adventure?

&#x200B;

# Back to the present

Advance bookings say otherwise as Boomers make a recreational bet on ""return to normal"".  Take Norwegian, for example:  They're advance bookings for 2021 is actually \*ahead of\* where they were in 2019 in spite of extending their global sailing boycott all the way to \*\*next May\*\*.  Royal Caribbean and Carnival both state that their 2021 bookings are back to exactly on par where they were before all this madness about spicy flu happened.  And these are just the people who are willing to fork over money right now that AREN'T afraid of the scamdem...oops, I mean...well...you know.  Just wait until everybody gets emboldened by their plot armo...I mean vaccinations.  More tellingly, the vast majority of people who were booked on canceled cruises, when given the choice between refunds or rollovers, chose rollovers.  Dumb move since money now is better than money later, but just another sign that we're all in a virtual simulation of Idiocracy.  Run with it.  Now add in the fact that, as we open up, people will be positively DESPERATE to go do something - ANYTHING - that's not in their house that they will positively crush any and all entertainment options - especially travel.  So, in a way, this DD could actually apply to stonks like Cedar & Six Flags or Disney or...whoever sells ""fun"", depending on what your definition of that is.  Thanks to the K-shaped recovery, most people in this country are sitting on a pile of extra cash they're just waiting to blow on an enhanced vacation package of some sort.

&#x200B;

But let's look under the hood for a moment, shall we?  The reason these 3 lines were able to stave off bankruptcy is threefold:  1, they all raised debt to create liquidity. That's generally bad, but since the Fed has been a free money printing machine for a while, they got some fantastic interest rates for that debt.  Matter of fact, 2 of the 3 of them used that new debt to pay off older, higher interest debt, then took out new new debt to make up the difference.  2, they all issued shares and created a small amount of dilution (though, in the case of Carnival, they were in the middle of a stock buyback when this all happened, so they basically ended up re-issuing the shares they had bought.  Bad for short term balance sheets, but long term lesser impact), and 3, they've been locked out of COVID related relief packages till now, which means their turn in the queue is widely viewed as coming up for their shot at free money roulette.  At present, it's looking like about a quarter billion dollars to them to bail them out.  They've already been able to shift their portage losses directly to the ports in question, so they saved some cash there, as well.

&#x200B;

So, using some napkin math and Yamazaki logic, the only thing preventing these cruise lines from going right back to where they were before all this happened is if they find themselves in a credit crunch, as the data shows that they will return to normal capacity operations in time.  So let's take a look at cash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Cash on hand for stonks](https://preview.redd.it/qije4vzf9ii61.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a7e7ffcc159e13c3971582f68aaef1147140f0)

&#x200B;

In the chart above, I took the liberty of adding $CUK, which is Carnival's ""other"" stonk.  Really, understanding this group, I guess I should have listed that one as the primary so you feel more comfortable about it as you listen to your wife get railed by her boyfriend.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

OK, so how much are they burning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Moneys](https://preview.redd.it/tn4v6mfc9ii61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f48de1c580e73a8819c42a2ac98473967f98547)

&#x200B;

Yeah, all you know exactly what this looks like - nobody knows better than WSB how to look at loss porn, and these cruise lines have a lot of it.  The gist here is that Carnival and Norwegian are probably fine financially for at least another year with no new income (and they have debt they haven't accessed yet at their disposal).  Royal Caribbean is in a little bit of a tighter spot, as they're going to have to go to the banks for money in the next 6 months barring a government bailout.  Norwegian is in a particularly envious position, because their debt levels are already lower than everybody else's and some of their smaller subsidiaries are going to be setting sail on those river cruises earlier, which will staunch their bleeding as Europe re-opens.

&#x200B;

Now, because I know all you retards love talking about shorts and what not, let's take a look at what Wall Street thinks of these stonks.  If they're going bankrupt, they're going to lean their chipstack in on them, right?

The smart money started piling in just before Christmas.  That's about when I got in on 2 of these, as well.  But I felt it was an aggressive move at the time.  Especially since we were missing a lot of vaccination data as well as any forward guidance from these companies.  They've since clarified their stance, and the vaccination data shows that we were already going to be rolling out a million doses a day, in spite of what one side of the aisle was claiming the mango was going to deliver on.  Volume tapered off to normal levels since then, but has since started picking up on the upbeat news that should have effect on this particular industry.

&#x200B;

Outlook:  I'm incredibly bullish on $NCLH.  I'm highly bullish on $CCL.  $RCL is a little more problematic to me, looking at the total picture, and I'm pretty neutral on them overall, bordering on skeptical.

I had more I wanted to talk about, but I'm tired of typing.

&#x200B;

# So, To summarize:

&#x200B;

* Your Boomer parents are going to start getting on these boats again as soon as they start floating
* Unlike last time (and thanks to the K-shaped recovery), they'll very likely splurge on the shore activity packages rather than cheap out and sit by the pool at every port this time since they have extra money to burn
* None of these companies are facing imminent financial threat, and have not only secured solid credit lines and nice reserves to weather this storm without sinking  (get it?  Hah), but actually showed their financial houses were pretty tight
* They've always been reliable earners, and will continue to be as they ramp back up.  This is a rare opportunity to get what is usually a slow moving Boomer stonk at a steep discount
* In the future, they'll actually be able to make MORE money because they had COVID as an excuse to suspend dividends, and don't think for a second they're going to be in a rush to bring those back even after shit returns to normal
* Your grandparents still don't love you either
* Buy a cruise ticket and you'll be sad, but you'll have enough money to where you'll be able to find some 45 year old who's a bit on the brown side of ripe that mistakenly thought they were going to be Stella and get their groove back with some strapping Jamaican native, who nonetheless will be impressed by your stack of tendies and will probably still give you blowies as you try to reach down to get to the base of her sagging tiddies
* Also invest in some pharma plays for the inevitable increase in senior citizen STD's that's going to occur when they can leave the nursing homes again.  Your widowed grandparents are going to bang at least 6 complete strangers on lobster night because they heard it was an aphrodisiac.

# Price targets:

$NCLH:  Probably $46 by 2022.  $60 by 2023

$CCL and $CUK:  $35 by 2022.  $47 by 2023.  For $CUK subtract 5 bucks

$RCL:  $90 by 2022.  $96 by 2023

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?

Well, retard, one thing you definitely don't do is play short term FD's on this.  Sorry, I know how much you love them, but have you considered shorting $RIOT if you hate money?  You'll get the same effect, but you can at least say you lost money on digital fake money, which will make you rare.  The answer here is OTM leaps.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  If you ain't got cruise stonks, you ain't black

# Position disclaimers:

&#x200B;

$CCL:  700 1/22 $25c's.  I'll likely expand this position to 1000 options

$NCLH:  2000 1/23 $42.5c's.  I'll very likely add another 3000 2023 calls if there's some terrible news that causes a precipitous drop

Edit 3:  $CCL just announced after the bell today (2/22) that they're issuing a billion dollars in shares again in a further dilution.  This is a surprise, as they don't have to do that given their cash on hand, and is undoubtedly looking to capitalize on the gains they've realized the last few months.  Obviously, such a level of dilution changes the thesis of $CCL a bit, and also creates uncertainty in the market for the other cruisers in whether they'll follow suit.  I don't have an updated math for this, but take it into account.",2021-02-19,119,43

However, I traded 12 different tickers by the EOD. 5 Winners 5 Losers, and 2 cancels (both slight gains). Some of my winners did not hit 2R as I generally plan, I moved stops up and had trouble finding market direction. Maybe I drank coffee too early this morning but I was not focused on my rules, so today I forced myself to run a mile for breaking my rules. I hate running, and I worked 10 hours on my feet all day delivering packages for UPS. This punishment will make me think twice about breaking rules next time. I started this punishment rule last week, and this is the first time I've had to run. 

&#x200B;

Another annoying thing is ToS will not show my trades on the chart tonight, so I drew in white line for entry, red for stop, and green for the exit. Today I will show two winners and my biggest loser. I am playing with chart colors, and I know I have a lot of indicators on my screen so I'll also show you it without all the indicators and so you can see that I actually took the trades as it is in my trade reviewing platform (tradsync, highly recommend btw). Hopefully, ToS fixes things tomorrow.

Simple trade here, midday fade. I waited for volume to fade off, lower indicators to all 3 turn down, and entered on the break of a pinbar (not textbook pinbar but was good enough for me). I set my target at VWAP and left it in brackets. I could have gotten a bit more and managed this differently, but I was headed to work when it triggered, so I was happy with 3R on this trade. 

[$MMEDF 5M](https://preview.redd.it/s8hfwt0pfo561.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca9e968d5d61d1ef94767f1e5e342c078eb6969)

Bearish open, held support, and momentum shifted. I missed the first entry, so I looked for a second.  I entered on an above-average volume bar, I had to chase a few cents because my fill was skipped. I set a tighter stop due to this to adjust risk. All 3 indicators supported the lower move. I scaled out roughly half my shares at the 50MA (deep purple line), and the rest at the premarket high. I could have taken more of this too but was happy with 2.5R and I also have a bit of this stock in my IRA so if the move would of went higher I'd be happy knowing I captured it there.

I'll be honest on this one, someone called this out in the group I trade-in, and I took it without confirming. This trade is part of why I had to run tonight. I have a rule that if a trade is suggested I must analyze the chart, see the trade, agree with the daily thesis, and use no more than 1/2 size. I used full size and bought into morning momentum with what looked like a pullback at the time. I had 0 supporting lower indicators, and I was using pre-market highs as a resistance, which didn't work out. I've learned this lesson before, but today I received a refresher. -1.5R due to slippage and mis sizing my trade. 

&#x200B;

I strongly suggest using similar rules when following trades on Twitter, Discord, Reddit, wsb, or whatever. Trades feel so much better, even losses when they are your own. When you follow someone, you naturally blame them. You are the only one to blame for your actions, and you're the only one who has to see your account p/l at the end of the day/week/month or whatever. The trick is to actually follow those rules, and remember everyone is right at some point, ESPECIALLY in bull markets. Don't fall into the trap of worshiping gurus, always do your own DD and make sure you understand why they think it is a good trade. My trade was an example of what not to do, and how even though I have learned this less and lost with much larger size, (I lost $65 on this, whereas I have lost over 3k on suggested trades in the past when I was undisciplined), I can still be reminded.",2020-12-17,9,0

Florida has no state income tax and needs cruises to restart with gov't aid ending.  Their governor wants the ports reopened.  60% of US cruises leave from Florida and the state is home to the three busiest cruise ports in the world.

Given that it was only a one month extension (to where the cruise lines voluntarily pushed it anyway) it is reasonable to assume that cruises will be given a chance to restart come November.  If they can actually get people out and back without killing dozens (big if), the cruise stocks will moon.

You can argue that people won't go back to cruises, but I'd say well then you've clearly never met cruise people.  Over 50% of passengers on cancelled cruises took credits vs. refunds.  A 3000 passenger ship would be full next week if it could sail.  Cruises were the fastest growing luxury travel segment precovid.

$OPTT - This seems like a high probability bullish setup. The stock has always respected the moving averages as supports and it's about to touch the 50 MA again. Great entry at $1.06. ([https://i.imgur.com/hBbrWQh.png](https://i.imgur.com/hBbrWQh.png))

$ACB - Another great setup with a great entry on the support of the trend line. This has been religiously following the trend lines and an entry on the support would be great. [https://i.imgur.com/OLbFuOS.png](https://i.imgur.com/OLbFuOS.png)

$PUMP - It seems to have formed a trend line albeit a slightly weak one. A good entry right now with a stop loss right below the trend line. ([https://i.imgur.com/zAdAWLr.png](https://i.imgur.com/zAdAWLr.png))

$KNDI - Decent setup with two entry points at $6.95 and $5.38. If it breaks the first level, right there should be a stop loss and the second entry should be at $5.38. ([https://i.imgur.com/Yrrh67f.png](https://i.imgur.com/Yrrh67f.png))

$HMHC - Not the best setup right now but there is a good support right below the current price. That would be a good entry level ([https://i.imgur.com/NSmk4kW.png](https://i.imgur.com/NSmk4kW.png)). Posted this because a lot of people like this stock in this subreddit.

# Bearish

$CRBP - High risk setup but a dip might be there after touching the resistance level at $8.3 ([https://i.imgur.com/Xq8sloe.png](https://i.imgur.com/Xq8sloe.png)) 

$CCL - Expecting cruise and air lines to continue dropping until we have a vaccine. Plus, there is  a trend line with a resistance at 15.5 level. ([https://i.imgur.com/GmbKlwb.png](https://i.imgur.com/GmbKlwb.png))

Of course, it's Jim Cramer, so take that as a grain of salt.

My questions is, is it better to sell short term covered calls (1 week out) at a price where I think ccl won’t get to and still make decent option premium...

-or-

Sell a jan22 20 strike call @ 5.15 and take close to 7.2k in premium. 

My thinking is if I do the latter, I would be ok with selling my shares at 20 dollars plus the 7.2k in covered call profits. 

What’s the downside, besides having to hold CCL for 2 years and having a 20$ cap on CCL?

"" **t was mid-March and the vultures were circling Carnival Corp., the largest cruise-line operator in the world.**  


**That all changed on March 23 when the Federal Reserve defibrillated bond markets with an unprecedented lending program. Within days, Carnival’s investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase** **&** **Co. were talking to conventional investors such as AllianceBernstein Holding and Vanguard Group about a deal. By April 1, the company had raised almost $6 billion in bond markets, paying rates far below those executives had discussed just days earlier.**  


**The previously unreported tale of Carnival’s rescue shows how effective the Fed has been in turning the debt spigot back on for large corporations.**   


**The idea of a cruise company raising so much new debt even as the pandemic worsened caught many by surprise. Nevertheless, fear of missing out attracted more investors. When Carnival officially sold a $4 billion bond on April 1, it had enough demand to cut the interest rate down to 11.5% and issue a $1.75 billion bond that could convert into stock.** """,2020-04-27,148,40

\+ Heavy insider buying  + Saudia Arab monies + UBS 'stress testing' it is priced like no cruising from now on to eternity.

But here's the reverse. It's one of the only companies whose future is crystal clear. And it's all-hands-on-deck over there trying to build a ship that won't sink even in the worst case.  

Other companies aren't in catastrophe management mode and if the worst happens - a recession and protracted pandemic - they would be going bankrupt way before CCL, because they are expecting a non-worst case return to normal.

These   options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and    strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking down their order to get filled faster.

Here - [https://imgur.com/a/nzRGcsp](https://imgur.com/a/nzRGcsp)

Also  all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest   in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either   buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the      aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of  these may be  hedges and some most likely not.

The BAC put orders are already in the money (ITM) mostly, so unsure about those. The orders that seem really aggressive is the GILD orders. I assume because of their drug for the beer virus. CCL is a no brainer but the IV is too high I think. MGM had aggressive unusual calls for the 13 calls for 05/15. Those seem to be a directional bet. So TSLA had put orders but it's hard to tell as tsla moves like a penny stock.

Don't   just  enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.   Use   technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined    instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry    about losing what u put in and be  smart, understand the risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!

Also with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.

Like I  did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I  have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These  orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the  confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and  unusual like SBUX order flow I posted about in the past.

fe4vlt_CCL,CCL,CCL straddle? (Carnival cruise lines),"Late to the party and just want to get a discussion going about this. As I am new to the option market.


CCL has dropped quite significantly already due to coronavirus affecting business, General market panic, etc.  

Straddle with 6 ish month time frame.

General Possibilities-

1) Virus gets worse, full blown zombie apocalypse proportions. Nobody books cruises for the rest of the year, ships have to be completely decontaminated because passengers who recently went on cruises have flu like symptoms. Massive profit loss. Stock takes a further nose dive 

2) Virus turns out to be much less deadly/prevalent due to the USAs healthcare system, or new treatment discovered that massively reduces mortality, etc
 Life returns to normal, coronavirus starts to fade out of the news as new world issues/election talk become prevalent.  Ticket sales start returning to normal,   “Maybe we over-reacted.....carnival looks like a bargain at these prices!”  Stock gains value- 15%or more, to previous highs

3) markets in turmoil, so much news- presidential election, fed rate cuts, coronavirus, bin laden spotted in LA??? Markets move a few percentage points  every week, usually self correcting the next week (mostly horizontal)



Issue with this strategy-

1). IV extremely high, going to be expensive to enter this position, requiring even higher price moves to break even.

2) this idea is about 3-6 weeks too late to really capitalize. (People already have entered this type of trade)

fahvp3_AAL,AAL,Aggressive/Unusual Options - AAL/CCL/GILD/MSFT,"Today   I included the aggressive  orders that I see, many of them instead of    just a few into one picture.  Today I didn't color code the calls/puts     but did color code the  companies.

These   options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order  to get filled faster.

Also   all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest  in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either   buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on the   aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some of    these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.

Data is here -[https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W](https://ibb.co/Br5PF3W)

The GILD calls seem out of the ordinary with HUGE strikes for the future.  For puts, watch CCL/AAL/V/UBER. CCL and Uber from the virus fears.

I  will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data       alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options    data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these. Use       protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in    and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into weekly    expiry's, consider a longer expiry.

Also with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined",2020-02-27,31,41
