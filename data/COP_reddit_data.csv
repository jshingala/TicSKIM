1jlcogn_CVX,CVX,ConocoPhillips or Chevron?,"I am trying to increase my exposure to large oil & gas producers with good dividends. I think $COP or $CVX are my best options. However, I have some concerns for both which makes it difficult to decide:

$COP

+ Great asset portfolio
+ Producer of only oil & gas (independent oil & gas company)
- I have not been able to find an overview of their development projects
- Dividend at 3.1% and seems to prioritise buybacks

$CVX
+ Good asset portfolio
+ Great development projects
+ Great dividend at 4% and increasing
- Not only an upstream producer of oil & gas, for example it also has a downstream business. Not what I am looking for as I only know the upstream business

I am not sure why $COP 'only' yields 3.1% but from what I could see, a 4% dividend is not sustainable with the current buybacks and oil price.

Do you have any comments regarding the above? Or should I look at any other producer?",2025-03-27,8,6

1i6li3r_COP,COP,ConocoPhillips: Alaska Resource Potential,"Referring to the referendum linked below, I did some research on potential company beneficiaries, and ConocoPhillips (COP) seems like a clear winner. I’ll caveat that there seems to be little interest in Energy companies investing capitol in Alaska as Supply and Demand is already harmonized. However, COP has a distinct position in this territory already, giving it what I believe is a strategic advantage. 

**The Willow Project**
COP began oil development in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve in 2023 under “The Willow Project”. The project is expected to produce 180,000 barrels of oil per day, and 600M barrels of oil in its lifetime. The argument against COP is that oil production will not be stood up until 2029. Despite this, they are ahead of their immediate competitors in this space. 

**Independent E&P Company**
COP operates as and independent exploration and production (E&P) company, meaning they focus primarily on upstream oil and gas production. The integrated oil and gas majors seem content with current refineries, making them an unlikely investor in the territory unless government grants are extremely lucrative. This leaves competitors like Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum as the major competitors, both of which have not pursued Alaska territory. 

**Financial Performance**

COP has demonstrated robust financial performance, consistently leading in revenue, net income, and production volumes among the three aforementioned companies. Its revenue grew from $46 billion in 2021 to an estimated $60 billion in 2024, supported by strategic investments like the Willow Project and acquisitions. Net income has shown similar strength, peaking at $18.62 billion in 2022 before stabilizing at around $12 billion in 2024. COP has the highest production volumes, reaching 1.917 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOED) in 2024, reflecting its focus on growth and operational efficiency. Competitive P/E ratio (~9.7).

1d3ccoe_COP,COP,ConocoPhillips to buy Marathon Oil in $17 billion all-stock deal that bolsters shale assets ,"ConocoPhillips agreed on Wednesday to buy Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction worth $17 billion, bolstering the company’s shale assets as the broader oil and gas industry undergoes a major wave of consolidation.

The deal will add 2 billion barrels of resources to ConocoPhillips’ inventory in the U.S., extending the company’s reach across shale fields in Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota.

“This acquisition of Marathon Oil further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading U.S. unconventional position,” ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement.

ConocoPhillips’ purchase of Marathon Oil follows blockbuster deals announced last fall by its two bigger rivals, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as the industry undergoes a transformational wave of consolidation.

The U.S. oil majors are growing even larger, buying up lucrative oil fields to boost shareholder returns even as governments are trying to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change.

Lance said the Marathon Oil transaction would grow ConocoPhillips’ earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns after the deal closes in the fourth quarter. ConocoPhillips expects share buybacks worth $7 billion in the first year after the deal is completed and $20 billion in the first three years.

The merger is expected to generate $500 million in savings in the first year through reduced administrative and operating costs because the companies’ assets are adjacent to each other.

ConocoPhillips’ stock was down 3.3% in early trading following the announcement as Marathon Oil shares surged 7.3%. ConocoPhillips is the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market capitalization of $137 billion, while Marathon Oil has a market cap of $14.4 billion.

ConocoPhillips is the last of the top three U.S. oil companies to pull the trigger on a big acquisition. Exxon recently completed its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources for $60 billion after receiving the greenlight from the Federal Trade Commission. Hess Corporation shareholders voted on Tuesday to advance the company’s $53 billion merger with Chevron.

Crude oil futures racked up their highest settlements since 2008 on Tuesday, with April WTI (CL1:COM) closing +3.6% at $123.70/bbl and May Brent (CO1:COM) ending +3.9% at $127.98/bbl, while U.S. retail gasoline prices continued to climb, as the national average price hit $4.173/gal early Tuesday, topping the previous record of $4.114/gal from July 2008.

""This the level where consumers start to push back. People start conserving energy and changing their behavior,"" Lance said.

The new U.S. ban on importing Russian oil, gas and products ""makes sense,"" at least for now, Lance told the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference, but if the war in Ukraine drags on for many months, a different plan would be needed to ensure sufficient oil supplies at affordable prices.

In an interview with CNBC, Lance said it would take 8-12 months to see ""the first drop of new oil"" if the company decided to pump more oil, which is ""why we have to be thinking about the medium and longer term.""

ConocoPhillips expects to spend 20% more capital this year than in 2021 and will increase production, and could decide to put even more capital to work, the CEO said, but the company ""needs to make sure the returns are there.""

""We're dealing with the same inflation and supply chain every other manufacturer is dealing with in the U.S.,"" Lance said, echoing comments made by Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub.",2022-03-08,653,367

The SEC is ""gonna vigorously lean in against individuals... ...to assess"".","# US House Financial Services Committee hearing on GameStop

&#x200B;

This is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):

&#x200B;

>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  
>  
>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\[1\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \[2\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \[3\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don’t you start.  
>  
>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  
>  
>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  
>  
>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I’ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  
>  
>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  
>  
>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \[those\] relationships.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>My time is coming done. *How are you going to solve this? Do you feel that we can so we don't have any more of this Gamestop?*  
>  
>\[Chair Gensler was directed to respond in writing to that question because the time was up for Rep. Scott’s questions.\]

> **Lululemon** — The yoga wear maker's stock is getting slammed after an earnings miss and a weak forecast. Lululemon fell a penny a share short of forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share, and its current-quarter guidance of 25 to 27 cents per share falls well short of the 39 cents consensus estimate. The company said its spring clothing isn't bold enough and promises to make more attractive gear and clothing to correct the problem.

1uvwfv_COP,COP,Coro Mining: COP on the TSX,"The junior mining market has been a blood bath for a while now but there is certainly money to be made getting in at the bottom.

This company is run by ex First Quantum guys and their VP of exploration in Chile is the guy who discovered the Toki Cluster.  Copper investors will know what I'm talking about.

Anyway I got into this company for their San Jorge copper gold project in Argentina which was a no go.  Sad faces all around on that one.

Anyway they are putting some money together to follow up on drilling the did at their El Desperado project in Chile which may or may not be another Toki style deposit.  In Nov 2012 they hit 200 plus meters of .55 copper and it bottomed in better that 1.00%

They haven't had the cash to drill again until this month.

Anyway I own it.  If they hit similar holes they stock is pretty much a home run at these prices.  If they miss they have a few other projects on the go - you can do your own DD.   

It's a long shot like all mining but I like the geology of the area and the proximity to the Toki Cluster.  

If there is a better sub to discuss these kinds of ""investments"", besides /gambling - please point me in that direction.
