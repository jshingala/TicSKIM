[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.

The movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.

1iz3qu5_CRM,CRM,"Salesforce misses on revenue, issues disappointing guidance","Salesforce reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday and issued a forecast that fell short of analysts’ estimates. The stock price slipped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.61 expected

Revenue: $9.99 billion vs. $10.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago in the quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share, from $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

The top category of subscription and support revenue was service, at $2.33 billion. The figure was up about 8% and below the $2.37 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. In the sales category, Salesforce generated $2.13 billion in revenue, up 8% and also trailing Visible Alpha’s consensus of $2.17 billion.

During the quarter, the company introduced its second-generation Agentforce artificial intelligence agent technology, which answers employee questions in the Slack team communications app.

Salesforce said it has completed more than 3,000 paid deals involving Agentforce since October. Agentforce has gotten involved in 380,000 conversations through Salesforce’s help website, with humans getting involved in 2% of cases, according to the statement.

“A lot of other vendors are talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they’ve got this really running at scale,” co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts.

Agentforce will make a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal 2026, with a larger effect in the following year, said Amy Weaver, Salesforce’s outgoing finance chief.

Benioff referred to a forthcoming product in the area of information technology service management, where ServiceNow operates.

The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency is using Slack, Benioff said.

“We’ll work closely with the government,” he said. “We’ll do anything we can to help them succeed.”

The company called for $2.53 to $2.55 in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter, with $9.71 billion to $9.76 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated adjusted earnings of $2.61 per share, with $9.9 billion in revenue.

For fiscal 2026, Salesforce is targeting $11.09 to $11.17 in adjusted earnings per share on $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion in revenue, implying 7.4% growth. The LSEG consensus was for adjusted earnings per share of $11.18 on $41.35 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Salesforce shares are down about 8% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 1%.

1i1uwe9_CRM,CRM,"Salesforce ($CRM) will lead (and profit from) the AI ""Digital Worker"" revolution","**TLDR:**  AI will start replacing jobs at a faster pace in 2025.  Salesforce has first-mover advantage in Agentic AI - a **$7t** market.  Expect the stock to shoot up as sales agreements and milestones are announced over the coming months.
________________________________

I feel like the market is sleeping on Salesforce.  All this cash being spent on GenAI/datacenters is so that these models can be utilized in a software solution that make workers more efficient.  So far it's the best way to monetize AI, and it's exactly what Salesforce is hyper-focused on.  In my mind, I don’t see how Salesforce doesn't end up dominating the Agentic AI space, and making a ton of money doing it.

Since a lot of people much smarter than I am are selling the stock, maybe I’m missing something.  I’d appreciate if you could take a look through my post and let me know your thoughts.

**Positions:**  ~$25k shares, ~$10k calls generally targeting $450 by Dec 2025.  Will continue to buy through to the end of the month, to total around $50k.

________________________________


##Salesforce has first dibs on the new “Digital Worker” market

There’s a general anxiety that eventually, AI will take everyone’s job.  While it’s safe to say that much of the labour force has nothing to worry about in the coming decade, there are some jobs that AI would consider low-hanging fruit:  call center staff, sales/project coordinators, customer success reps...  These types of jobs could be replaced much sooner than the rest.

The market is teetering near all-time highs waiting to see whether the AI bubble will solidify, or pop.  Many have said that AI is all hype, and that until the technology makes significant advancements, the rising valuations are unwarranted.  Many others think that the AI hype will be confirmed as real in the near future.

Salesforce, in the meantime, is accepting the challenge.  In Sept ’24 they announced Agentforce, an Agentic AI platform, which they released a month later.  In December, they announced Agentforce 2.0, which includes additional features.  It seems like they’ve got all hands on deck building and selling this new product.  Benioff (CEO) is pretty shamelessly hocking the product as well to anyone that will listen.

In my opinion, Salesforce is pivoting away from being a CRM company, to an Agentic AI company.  In the coming years, Agentforce revenue will make up a higher and higher percentage of their revenue.  As their AI advances, it stands to reason that Agentforce will even cannibalize CRM seats – for much more revenue, of course.

[Digital labour is predicted to be a $7t market in the coming years](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent), and Salesforce appears to be the first-mover, on top of already having the advantage of being the biggest SaaS company in the world.  I don’t see how this plays out any other way than them taking a good chunk of the $7t market for themselves.

###Reasons I’m bullish
#####1. Massive existing customer base with an easy upsell
They are deeply entrenched with thousands customers (including 90% of the Fortune 500).  A lot of them already have Slack installed.  For some of the bigger accounts, they are already hosting training-relevant data in “Data Cloud”.  For many clients, it’s possible that deploying agents would require not much more than a bit of configuration.  Licensing model is “pay-as-you-go”, so sign-ups should be easy to get. Agentforce revenue should start hitting the books fairly soon.

#####2. New clients/segments
Salesforce can use the promise of efficient digital labour to close customers that were previously on the fence.  On top of that, they can now approach segments that had no prior interest in Salesforce at all.  (See the recently announced [Agentforce for Retail](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/01/10/agentforce-retail-cloud-pos-announcement/))

#####3.	The Benioff Factor
You don’t have to like the guy, but Benioff is pushing Agentforce like his life depended on it.  Given his track record with Salesforce and the sheer shamelessness in his recent behaviour on social media (which I only recently started paying attention to), I can’t help but see him as a positive factor as it relates to the success of the Agentforce launch and the stock in general.

Recently Benioff has ingratiated himself to Musk over social media.  [Last month, Benioff suggested that Musk’s DOGE could use Agentic AI to reduce costs in government.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-doge-has-a-real-shot-at-cutting-costs-and-new-technologies-could-help-131314725.html)  It's possible DOGE recommends AI agents as a govt cost-cutting measure.  Salesforce is ready for that:

> ""We already have relationships with a lot of government agencies. We're already talking to them about how to bring this technology in to create more efficient agencies. And we want to continue to have even more conversations, not just with the US government, but all the governments that we have relationships within the world, really all companies. Everybody needs to embrace this technology,"" Benioff said.

#####4. All Hands On Deck
Salesforce has practically rebranded itself as an Agentic AI company in the past few months.  It has reconfigured the organization to focus almost entirely on Agentforce.  If they were simply releasing a new AI feature, then there would be a risk of, for example, Microsoft announcing a competing product, or ServiceNow being a serious contender.  But as it stands, simply due to the fact that they are not holding anything back, there will be no catching up to Agentforce.

#####5. Agentforce used internally at Salesforce
Benioff has stated that Salesforce is using Agentforce internally and that it is already significantly reducing the workload on staff.  If true, this is extremely bullish for two reasons.  Obviously, it serves as a POC for their customers, making Agentforce not only easier to sell, but quicker to deploy.  For me though, a more interesting take on this is that Benioff now needs to demonstrate a visible reduction in Salesforce operating expenses, which should increase net profit.  This would need to be shown on the next earnings call, on both reported numbers, and FY26 forecasts.

#####6. 2025 – the year of Agentic AI
AI will be the focus in 2025 as the market tries to justify the Mag 7’s furious spending on AI infrastructure.  In the past week both Jensen Huang and Satya Nadella have made statements claiming that Agentic AI is where SaaS is going.  If that is indeed the focus of 2025, and if Salesforce/Benioff continue screaming to anyone that will listen that they are 100% all in, it should create excitement around both the product, as well as the stock.  

#####7. Fundamentals

Salesforce is fairly priced at the moment, with a FP/E of 26.  Compared to other SaaS companies like ServiceNow (60) or HubSpot (77) it's an absolute bargain.  It's priced even better than Microsoft (34).  

#####8.	Future Potential (watch as I go off the deep end)
Agentforce is only the first step.  As AI develops, a more advanced version will essentially function as a fully capable employee, with access to all company data posted on Salesforce Data Cloud.  It will also have access to abstracted data across all of Salesforce, making it the most knowledgeable, experienced salesperson(?) in the world.

Is that a bit farfetched?  Maybe.  Impossible?  I don’t think so...  But what’s true, is that Salesforce is the only company with access to all that data.  I think it's likely that they will ultimately be able to pull it off.

###Bearish points + counter-arguments:

#####1.	New business model

Agentforce comes at a price tag of $2 per conversation.  I don’t think we know what that means yet, because this technology and the use-case is entirely new.  How many Agentforce conversations will an Enterprise customer use per month?  10,000?  500,000?  How many of the agent use-cases will actually perform well?  It’s going to be very hard to forecast revenue growth in the coming year, which adds uncertainty.  (Contrast this, for example, to a licensing model where users would simply have to upgrade to a license that cost an additional 30%.)

**Counter:**  While it’s hard to predict the expected revenue growth in the coming months, the positive angle is that this pricing model shows Salesforce’s extreme confidence in the product.  (Microsoft, to compare, has bundled CoPilot onto their M365 subscription service and increased pricing, without giving the customer any choice in the matter.)  It’s possible uptake will be a bit slow, I guess... but if customers do sign on (and thousands of them already have), Agentforce revenue should only go up as the offering improves and customers learn how to make better use of it.

#####2.	Everyone is using AI agents – Salesforce isn’t doing anything special

All companies are using AI agents already.  Salesforce isn’t doing anything special.  They’re just trying to pump their stock by building a product that does “AI”.

**Counter:**  Of course some companies are building AI agents, and they’ll obviously continue to do so.  But when it comes to workflow automation within Salesforce integrated solutions, all this stuff comes out of the box with Agentforce.  The customer doesn't have to build anything.  Generally, companies do not want to get involved with developing custom solutions for internal processes.

#####3.	Competition from other SaaS Companies

There are other companies in the space working on Agentic AI (ie, ServiceNow, HubSpot).  They may build a better product causing Agentforce to flop.  Salesforce is too old and decrepit to compete.

**Counter:**

* Neither of these companies come close to how entrenched/integrated Salesforce is with Enterprise customers.  It’s unrealistic to expect that their products would be so much better, to the point where a major customer chooses them over their existing Salesforce setup.

* Despite being ancient compared to some other SaaS companies, Salesforce regularly releases new major product lines.

* Competitors won’t be able to match Salesforce’s breadth across segments – particularly into Enterprise.

#####4.	Agentic AI won’t be good enough to replace workers

In the same way that nobody likes the chatbots that show up on websites to help (aka Clippy), Agentic AI will never be as good as a human at getting work done.  Over the next year, customers might decide that Agentforce doesn’t work well for them, and simply not use it that much.

**Counter:**

* Customers wouldn’t need to have the AI do everything on its own.  Some tasks would be left to humans.  There are plenty of simpler, more transactional tasks, though, that can be automated, freeing humans to spend more time on more complex ones.

* In many cases, I imagine customers would be willing to reduce service quality by 10% if it meant cost savings of 90%.

* It’s possible to argue that for some tasks, the AI would actually do a better job than the human.  (No typos, no missed messages, quicker task resolution, etc)

#####5.	Analysts forecast mediocre growth, even in 2026

Revenue growth over Salesforce’s FY2026 (which starts in April) is projected at 9%, which isn’t great.  While Agentforce might be a quality product, it would be too early to generate meaningful revenue.

**Counter:**  There is no reason to assume Agentforce should take so long to start generating meaningful revenue.

* Agentforce has a tiny sales cycle.  Enterprise customers already have it included in their licensing
* The tool is built into Salesforce.  Some agents can be set up in under an hour.
* With Agentic AI being a trend in 2025, customers should be more eager to implement it.",2025-01-15,36,72

# Salesforce Goes All In on AI, Investors Cheer

Salesforce shares shot up nearly 11% on Wednesday, hitting an all-time high, as the CRM titan unveiled quarterly results that surpassed expectations and flaunted its shiny new AI darling, Agentforce. 

Revenue for Q3 grew 8.3% year-over-year to $9.44 billion, just ahead of Wall Street’s projections. Meanwhile, profitability flexed its muscles, with an adjusted operating margin of 33.1%, beating forecasts.

**Agentforce: Your New AI Wingman**

Meet Agentforce: Salesforce’s AI-powered assistant designed to handle customer support and sales grunt work without breaking a sweat. Rolled out in October, it’s already clocking over 200 deals, scoring big names like FedEx and IBM. At $2 a pop per agent conversation, this chatbot’s looking like a moneymaker.

CEO Marc Benioff called Agentforce’s Salesforce-powered data integration its “unfair advantage”—think Iron Man’s suit but for sales reps. 

And Salesforce isn’t shy about doubling down: 2,000 new hires are on deck to push the product. But some analysts are cautious about whether Agentforce can sustain its buzz or if it’s just another chatbot in a crowded AI market.

**AI = Salesforce’s Shot in the Arm**

After a rough spring—hello, layoffs and slowing growth—Salesforce is back in the game. The stock has rebounded more than 50% since May, riding the AI hype train. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Analysts like Guggenheim’s John DiFucci wonder if Salesforce can keep charging premium prices for a tool that could soon be everywhere.

For now, Salesforce is leaning into its AI-fueled momentum, betting on Agentforce to keep it ahead of the pack. If nothing else, the buzz is doing wonders for the stock—and that’s a win any way you spin it.

# China Hits Back At U.S. With Export Ban On Rare Minerals

Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are taking a metallic turn. Beijing has banned the export of gallium, germanium, and other rare minerals to the U.S., countering fresh Biden administration restrictions on advanced chip-making tech. These minerals aren’t just shiny rocks—they’re critical for everything from chips to electric vehicles (EVs) to military hardware.

**Why This Matters:**

1. Global Reliance: China is the top dog in rare mineral production, dominating gallium and germanium supplies. The U.S., meanwhile, depends on these imports to fuel industries like semiconductors and renewable energy.
2. Economic Impact: A total ban on these minerals could shave $3.4 billion off the U.S. GDP, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
3. EVs in the Crosshairs: Tighter controls on graphite exports—a key EV battery material—could hit automakers scrambling to scale up production.

**High-Stakes Moves**

This isn’t the first time China has played the mineral card. A similar squeeze on Japan in 2010 prompted Tokyo to slash reliance on Chinese supply chains. The U.S. may attempt a similar pivot, but diversifying mineral imports could take years.

Meanwhile, Beijing’s move signals it’s willing to use its mineral dominance as a counter to U.S. tech sanctions. With President-elect Trump threatening to escalate trade measures further, this tit-for-tat battle is far from over.

**The Takeaway:** China’s restrictions highlight the urgency for the U.S. to secure alternative supplies of critical minerals. But in the short term, these dueling measures are creating ripples across industries—from chipmakers to car manufacturers—leaving both economies vulnerable in the process. As the world’s two largest economies dig in, the tech and trade landscape is increasingly becoming a high-stakes chessboard.

# Salesforce Goes All In on AI, Investors Cheer

Salesforce shares shot up nearly 11% on Wednesday, hitting an all-time high, as the CRM titan unveiled quarterly results that surpassed expectations and flaunted its shiny new AI darling, Agentforce. 

Revenue for Q3 grew 8.3% year-over-year to $9.44 billion, just ahead of Wall Street’s projections. Meanwhile, profitability flexed its muscles, with an adjusted operating margin of 33.1%, beating forecasts.

**Agentforce: Your New AI Wingman**

Meet Agentforce: Salesforce’s AI-powered assistant designed to handle customer support and sales grunt work without breaking a sweat. Rolled out in October, it’s already clocking over 200 deals, scoring big names like FedEx and IBM. At $2 a pop per agent conversation, this chatbot’s looking like a moneymaker.

CEO Marc Benioff called Agentforce’s Salesforce-powered data integration its “unfair advantage”—think Iron Man’s suit but for sales reps. 

And Salesforce isn’t shy about doubling down: 2,000 new hires are on deck to push the product. But some analysts are cautious about whether Agentforce can sustain its buzz or if it’s just another chatbot in a crowded AI market.

**AI = Salesforce’s Shot in the Arm**

After a rough spring—hello, layoffs and slowing growth—Salesforce is back in the game. The stock has rebounded more than 50% since May, riding the AI hype train. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Analysts like Guggenheim’s John DiFucci wonder if Salesforce can keep charging premium prices for a tool that could soon be everywhere.

For now, Salesforce is leaning into its AI-fueled momentum, betting on Agentforce to keep it ahead of the pack. If nothing else, the buzz is doing wonders for the stock—and that’s a win any way you spin it.

# China Hits Back At U.S. With Export Ban On Rare Minerals

Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are taking a metallic turn. Beijing has banned the export of gallium, germanium, and other rare minerals to the U.S., countering fresh Biden administration restrictions on advanced chip-making tech. These minerals aren’t just shiny rocks—they’re critical for everything from chips to electric vehicles (EVs) to military hardware.

**Why This Matters:**

1. Global Reliance: China is the top dog in rare mineral production, dominating gallium and germanium supplies. The U.S., meanwhile, depends on these imports to fuel industries like semiconductors and renewable energy.
2. Economic Impact: A total ban on these minerals could shave $3.4 billion off the U.S. GDP, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
3. EVs in the Crosshairs: Tighter controls on graphite exports—a key EV battery material—could hit automakers scrambling to scale up production.

**High-Stakes Moves**

This isn’t the first time China has played the mineral card. A similar squeeze on Japan in 2010 prompted Tokyo to slash reliance on Chinese supply chains. The U.S. may attempt a similar pivot, but diversifying mineral imports could take years.

Meanwhile, Beijing’s move signals it’s willing to use its mineral dominance as a counter to U.S. tech sanctions. With President-elect Trump threatening to escalate trade measures further, this tit-for-tat battle is far from over.

**The Takeaway:** China’s restrictions highlight the urgency for the U.S. to secure alternative supplies of critical minerals. But in the short term, these dueling measures are creating ripples across industries—from chipmakers to car manufacturers—leaving both economies vulnerable in the process. As the world’s two largest economies dig in, the tech and trade landscape is increasingly becoming a high-stakes chessboard.

1h60pge_CRM,CRM,"Salesforce shares rise after earnings beat on revenue, fourth-quarter guidance","Salesforce shares were up 8% on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue and fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

Here is how the company did compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.41 adjusted vs. $2.44 expected
* **Revenue:** $9.44 billion vs. $9.34 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year-over-year during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.

Salesforce said that it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to come in between $9.90 billion to $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.

The company said that it expects an earnings per share between the range of $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth-quarter, compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.65.

Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2025 to come between $37.8 billion and $38 billion. That’s up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the mid point for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $37.86 billion.

“We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. “Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.”

The company in August announced that CFO Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move “in the right direction” in regards to improving its profit margin.

Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce “can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.”

1facdfe_CRM,CRM,Stock based comp.  - Impact on earnings (Examples Docusign and Salesforce) while FCF is strong. How do you adapt your valuation? How do you think about it?,"Hey everyone, 

I am wondering how you think about and consider stock based compensation in your valuation models (e.g. DCF)? Wall Streets darling companies (e.g. Salesforce) or ex-darling companies (e.g. DocuSign) have huge stock-based compensations that reduce net-income. Financially they always talk aboud Non-GAAP adj. Net Income / EPS, which almost seems like fraud considering that the stock based compensation is not going away any time soon... Fortunately we have the GAAP standards :-) 

  
**Example Docusign (DOCU):** The company is out of favor and the share price has bottomed out. Yesterday, the company presented solid earnings. 7% Revenue growth. 200M FCF for the quarter. The company is valued at 13x LTM Free Cash Flow; 4.1 P/LTM Sales. But P/E LTM (excl. their recent tax benefit) around 70. They are using much of their FCF to keep share dilution low. Aside from this, it has become a solid company, fairly valued (when excluding stock-based comp.) with great ARR. But the stock based comp sucks!

**Salesforce (CRM):** Salesforce is doing pretty much the same. Would we exclude the stock-based compensation its P/E would be around 25 - instead of 42.

  
Over the last 20 year the new economy came to the conclusion that it can pay itself fairly well through stock based comp.! And I don't see any changes in this regard going forward. It is almost like owning a mining company that continously dilutes shareholders while telling you that net income will ""come at some point"". 

  
If I would consider this in a DCF I am wondering how to account for it. I would likely use (1) FCF minus Share Buy Backs and forcast this adjusted value into the future. (2) Another option would be using the FCF and adj every year by the shares outstanding that I would forcast based on dilution. Terminal value would be much lower caused by the share dilution.  

How do you think about this? Do you even look at their adjusted numbers? Wall Street and Analysts seem to work with these adjusted EPS / net income numbers.

Looking forward to your insights and guidance.  ",2024-09-06,6,5

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings: $2.44 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.38 per share expected

Revenue: $9.13 billion, vs. $9.17 billion expected

Salesforce called for adjusted earnings per share in the current quarter of $2.34 to $2.36 on $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected $2.40 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.37 billion in revenue.

Revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, increased 11% from $8.25 billion a year earlier, Salesforce said in a statement. Net income jumped to $1.53 billion, or $1.56 per share, from $199 million, or 20 cents per share a year ago.

Salesforce numbers are out tomorrow so is there anything worth doing??

[are we breaking out or is this the top of the channel?](https://preview.redd.it/x52gjt5ya7lc1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c4a173b7d20b7989954ead5e692ba1b3bb44180)

I am torn between this looking like it could break out to the upside or that we are at the top of the channel.

I am going to run 2 different scenarios and leave that choice down to you. 

&#x200B;

[Implied vols](https://preview.redd.it/vlnlp7gtb7lc1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=d538d1e2d7583cb94164bc924c57651323ae994c)

You can see by the straddle page that our expected move for the number is close to $18 whilst you look further out we only have an $8 move per day priced in. 

&#x200B;

[upside targets](https://preview.redd.it/xe4owtb6c7lc1.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=8515e26dd7e78a2ba6ee26a0a225afa0013f4e01)

&#x200B;

So although it is an ""earnings"" play I go further out, avoiding short term spikes and seeing of the earnings will set the trend over the next couple of months, so I am looking 112 days out from now to see what can be done.

&#x200B;

[BB1 list](https://preview.redd.it/0ohnadhjc7lc1.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c0eb572622fb45779d1726523177bb7551ddc3)

There are a couple of good upside trades here with a good ""trade score"" ( our version of a risk/reward number)

I would go with BB1's first choice and going with the JUNE (EXPIRATION)

https://preview.redd.it/nvtblr12d7lc1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=791203cd729c8c8c7e227e24b0111af8ed22ea64

Yes, I like trading flies, they are a closed off risk and you know what you can make/lose. Now lets look at the HEAT MAP

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4w6cisscd7lc1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=46346c4c3626b24cecaa74876097971b746dc894

You can get in and make money quickly if youre right in direction and totally clean up as time progresses and if wrong you can get out for not too bad a loss too.

So these are the details for the upside play

https://preview.redd.it/kqn9k0l0e7lc1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=2263b1209a950fcfa769d15982609d1f394c1a07

Now for the downside.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/95roia49e7lc1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=e82edd3f05f6dae6937898a5683c9e6f71740f00

I am only going 49 days out for this one, as I believe that if it does reject the breakout we will head to the bottom of the channel a bit quicker.

&#x200B;

[BB1's downside list](https://preview.redd.it/kmnyjgoke7lc1.png?width=1674&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c91934aeaa6f5c3b07a36f99605ebca5f9b965)

Now BB1 is wanting me to buy 1x2 put spreads...it looks at what it perceives as risk, but for you guys I would avoid shorting put premium unless you actually have the view that if it gets down there I WANT to own it. So I am going for the

It is 5th on the list and I could do the fly that it picked instead, but it just monetizes a little quicker

184lkd7_MRVL,MRVL,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

165f733_CRM,CRM,"Expected moves and more: Salesforce, Okta, Chewy and Crowdstrike","The indices are flat to start this Wednesday. Some important economic data just dropped but it doesn't seem to be moving markets too much. GDP was revised lower and ADP jobs was lower than expected. The US 1 and 2-year yields are down slightly.

Today we have a slew of earnings after the bell, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike headlining, but also Okta, Chewy, Five Below and more. See below for current expected moves. We looked at CRM yesterday so let's cover CRWD today. Here's the current expected move chart: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1kkyq5339lb1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd94ea845432412c82053680e96b56f1786cf3b3

The expected move of 7% compares to recent actual moves of -2%,  
 \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.

The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

An Iron Condor, selling the 7% move would need the stock to stay between $134 and $160 essentially. With max gain between $136 and $157.50. It risks about $3 to make $2.

165f733_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves and more: Salesforce, Okta, Chewy and Crowdstrike","The indices are flat to start this Wednesday. Some important economic data just dropped but it doesn't seem to be moving markets too much. GDP was revised lower and ADP jobs was lower than expected. The US 1 and 2-year yields are down slightly.

Today we have a slew of earnings after the bell, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike headlining, but also Okta, Chewy, Five Below and more. See below for current expected moves. We looked at CRM yesterday so let's cover CRWD today. Here's the current expected move chart: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1kkyq5339lb1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd94ea845432412c82053680e96b56f1786cf3b3

The expected move of 7% compares to recent actual moves of -2%,  
 \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.

The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

An Iron Condor, selling the 7% move would need the stock to stay between $134 and $160 essentially. With max gain between $136 and $157.50. It risks about $3 to make $2.

Salesforce shares soared 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the cloud software maker beat Wall Street estimates on profit and issued a better-than-expected forecast.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $1.68 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.36 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $8.38 billion, vs. $7.99 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Salesforce’s revenue grew 14% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported a loss of $98 million, compared with a loss of $28 million in the year-ago quarter.

Profitability has become a higher priority at Salesforce, which in recent months has been getting pressured by an influx of activist investors, including Third Point, Elliott Management and Starboard Value. The company announced the addition of ValueAct Capital CEO Mason Morfit to its board.

In January Marc Benioff, Salesforce’s co-founder and CEO, said the company would cut 10% of its workforce, representing over 7,000 people. At the end of the quarter Bret Taylor, who ran Salesforce as co-CEO alongside Benioff, stepped down.

For the fiscal first quarter, the company called for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.61 per share and revenue of $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been looking for $1.32 in adjusted earnings per share and $8.05 billion in revenue.

Salesforce sees adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $7.12 to $7.14 and revenue of $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $5.84 in adjusted earnings per share and $34.03 billion in revenue.

Salesforce shares have risen 26% so far this year, excluding Wednesday’s after-hours move, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 3% over the same period.",2023-03-01,389,86
11fb6dk_CRM,CRM,Why I'm getting CRM calls for earnings today,"Salesforce (CRM) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 1. The cloud-based software maker’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation.

With hybrid work trending right now, there's been a massive and continuing adoption of software-as-a-service-based platforms all over the world. This drives the demand for Salesforce’s cloud-based solutions. Salesforce’s diverse cloud offerings are likely to have helped expand its clientele, fueling the top line.

Salesforce’s initiatives to capitalize on the overseas demand for cloud-based applications are anticipated to have bolstered the top line during the period in discussion. Further, the improved customer experience is anticipated to have aided the cloud segment.

Salesforce’s ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is expected to have been the key driver. CRM’s Customer 360 Truth platform, which helps connect the data from sales, service, marketing and commerce and build a single Salesforce ID for each customer, is likely to have boosted its performance. Also, its focus on AI and the substantial progress in its Einstein Analytics platform make it optimistic about the upcoming quarterly results.

**Last Week – SPY exits tight February range to the downside.**

SPY fell about 2.7% last week, a larger move than options were pricing (1.5%). Treasury yields spiked as inflation worries renewed. The 2-year yield closed Friday at 4.81, its highest level since 2007. Implied vol continued its rise from the week before. The VIX got over 23 during the week before closing Friday just under 22. A little downside uncertainty returned as the SPX broke below the tight range it had been trading in February.

**This Week – Does the rise of IV continue?**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.6% move for the week. We are still in an environment where expected moves across the market are muted compared to the past year. But last week’s selloff was also the first time in about a month where the market moved to the downside significantly more than what options were pricing. And it came during a week of rising treasury yields, which had been rough moments for stocks in 2022. IV has crept up the past 2 weeks but the market was mostly seeing moves cancel each other out. If the market were to continue lower this week one would expect IV to continue to rise (as the VIX is still in the low 20’s.) The VIX has not been above 25 since December and at 22 is not that much higher than its historical mean. In 2022, VIX spikes toward 30 tended to coincide with market bounces and IV is nowhere near that level at the moment, indicating a wait-and-see approach on last week’s selling. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 1.6% expected move, about $390 on the downside and $403 on the upside.

I use salesforce at work, and it is honestly dog shit; companies full of boomers still use it. Still, those boomers are about to learn a whole new generation of human-assisting technology comes from AI - I bet someone is going to get an idea and build that from this post.   


I believe is a tremendous long-term short op. as long as salesforce does not evolve and adapt AI to help streamline the design and merge with other platforms to become a larger market share holder. So I am thinking of buying leap puts for 90$ as I believe the stock price is fairly valued at around 75$ in the next year.

There are many companies that don’t justify having a crazy growth stock multiple. Tesla isn’t one of them, you regards who are jumping on the “puts” train are too late.  I see this all the time here.  Shorting would have been an intelligent move $130 and above. Shorting at $100 and then putting out stupid misleading posts to justify your stupid puts is the wsb way

zgdles_CRM,CRM,Managing Losses Feedback - CRM earnings play 138/125 PCS,"&#x200B;

Just hoping to get a bit of feedback about my strategy for managing my losses in this particular case. I sold a Put Credit Spread on CRM with 18 DTE just before earnings. Not long after, huge drop in share price thanks to their co-CEO and a couple of other big names leaving (earnings actually beat the estimate).

Since then, I have been selling and closing Call Credit Spreads for small profits to mitigate the losses essentially temporarily turning my PCS into an Iron Condor temporarily, but closing the Call Spreads whenever they reach around 50%, which was pretty quick as the price was steadily dropping.

Today, I've rolled my PCS out another week, as I'm fairly confident the stock will rebound at some point, hopefully soon. Didn't want to roll much further as it would've eaten too far into the original credit received. I've also opened another CCS, but if the share price starts to go up again this may be the last one for now.

Open to any thoughts on what I should have done differently (aside from not writing the PCS in the first place, I don't feel like that was a bad move, it just went against me) or any feedback.

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

Over the weekend Tesla (TSLA) announced a 25% increase to the price of their “full self-driving” software. Tesla shares are up 40% from recent lows and off about 5% from recent highs. Over the past year Tesla stock has seen multiple 20%+ rallies that take place over 3-4 week spans. The most recent rally from July 15th to August 15th was the largest of those moves percentage-wise. Since the all time high in Nov of ’21 the stock has put in two lower highs at the apex of these sharp rallies, first in January, then in April. The last large move lower in the stock that happened from early April to mid May saw the stock down more than 50%.

As stated before, Tesla stock has seen moves way beyond option pricing on a consistent basis for the past year, both higher and lower. Here’s a look at the past year’s moves as compared to the current expected move in the options market. Options are pricing about an 11% move over the next month, and only about a 25% move out to January, much less than the types of moves the stock has seen over the past year:

Be mindful of companies that have to burn shareholder value to grow, make sure stock compensation is priced into your assessment. To help with this, instead of looking at revenue and net income and fcf in absolutes, look at these metrics PER SHARE.

Hope this is helpful as you try to assess value in beaten down tech that uses lots of equity promises to lure top talent.

### In the News

Oil, gas and energy companies are some of the best-performing stocks over the past few months, with some at our near all-time highs. Many top the high RSI (overbought) lists after seeing multi-year lows during the pandemic. For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100.

Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either. There are a lot of moving parts for these stocks right now, the war in Ukraine, a potential recession to name a few., but as volatility has visited both the broader stock market and the oil and gas markets, these stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have ”crashed higher” towards all-time highs without seeing corresponding increases in their own option implied volatility. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge, as put spreads for any reverse in oil prices are cheap (relative to oil itself) on the single name company side of things.

u4dsoz_CRM,CRM,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","Follow-up to my MSFT/GOOGL/NVDA post earlier this week (resolution there was to keep all three but perhaps trim them some).  **This is part two, but will likely be the last such post for a while as I do not intend to bombard you with these types of posts (I know they might get annoying) but do value your feedback.**

What are your thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM?  By long-term I mean for the next 5-10 years, and taking into consideration various scenarios like stagflation, recessions, or on the flip side, an economic boom if Powell can figure out inflation and Putin loses his war quickly.

My preliminary thoughts:

* AMZN: Overall, I see it as a good stock with a weakening moat.  AWS is their crown jewel and will likely remain so, but they are facing increasing competition from MSFT, GOOGL and others (e.g. ORCL, IBM, but these are to a much lesser extent).  E-Commerce appears to be slower growth especially given the immense costs of capex (delivery, warehouses).  E-Commerce is facing increasing competition from others like TGT, WMT, and SHOP, and the first two of these are already big box stores and thus do not need to spend as much on capex to ramp up.  For example, TGT/WMT offer buy and pick up services, which while not as convenient as AMZN prime, is still pretty useful (I use it sometimes).  Bottom line, I fear AMZN's growth will be slower going forward, which does not bode well as its PE is also quite a bit higher than MSFT and GOOGL.

* ADBE: Its software is ubiquitous, but seems to have stalled out on growth.  My favorite segment of theirs is actually the Experience Cloud, which appears unique but is having inconsistent results.  Document Cloud faces heavy competition from Docusign, etc. and anyway is free for most users (Adobe Acrobat Reader) or already installed (meaning incremental revenue would have to come from fee increases and not necessarily new licenses).  Creative Cloud remains good, but it is mostly focused on 2D AFAIK.  If 3D imaging continues to gain steam, I see ADSK and U being better.  Bottom line and as with AMZN, competition and over-saturation are issues.

* CRM: It appears quite clear that its sales platform is saturated, and it appears that even Marc Benioff knows that (hence the Tableau and Slack acquisitions).  I see the Analytics Cloud as being potentially the biggest gamechanger of theirs as Tableau's competitors are rather weak and smaller companies (e.g. Alteryx).  I have heard that Microsoft has a competing product called PowerBI, but I don't know exactly how it stacks up to Tableau.  Not sure though if the Analytics Cloud will be enough to take CRM to significantly higher growth (e.g. 20%+ revenue growth yoy).",2022-04-15,18,20

r45qtm_CRM,CRM,$CRM straddle/strangle? Anyone?,"I’ve been a moderately successful day trader of stocks for a couple of years, small account. I fell into options accidentally a couple few weeks ago (sold some $XPEV calls  to stem the loss on a couple hundred shares I was holding, and have been selling and closing covered calls every day or two since then, because the price action has been perfect for it), and now I am fascinated, excited for the potential, and have been reading like crazy. I want to try my first thoughtful options bet this week, and I am looking at a long straddle or strangle on Salesforce, which has earnings on Tuesday.

**TL;DR—Is $CRM a good play this week, and how would you play it?**

First, I get that I am too late for a good entry, but I think it might still be possible to make a little money, and am considering the smallest possible bet, one contract per leg.

I’m not necessarily expecting an earnings surprise from Salesforce, but anecdotally I feel like the market itself has brought a lot of earnings surprises this year, usually in the form of substantial drops on earnings beats. $CRM has been in a strong uptrend for months, but is sharply down over the last week or so. It just crossed below the 50-day MA, opening and closing there with a red doji on Friday, but the 50-day line is still diverging upward from the 200. If I am reading the options chain correctly, it looks like the market has a somewhat long bias. Mostly I just have a feeling the stock isn’t going to go sideways from here, which is why this strategy interests me.

So, my question is even though I know I should have been thinking about this a few weeks ago, is it still reasonable to think I might make a profit here? If so, would it be better to do a straddle at a single strike price, or maybe a long strangle, where I have lower premiums but more risk to the downside. My instinct is to get the 3DTE or 10DTE and aim for a quick profit on intrinsic value. Is that ridiculous? Should I buy LEAPS instead?

The other option would be, since I have a slightly long bias here, to just buy a call, watch what happens, and get out for a 10% loss if it goes the wrong way on me. That’s easy, though…and now that am starting to see the power of options, I want to try a real strategic, multi-leg position to test my mettle.

I appreciate any help or suggestions, and comments about how dumb I am or what obvious things I’ve missed or misunderstood are entirely welcome.",2021-11-28,1,16

## Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

Earnings season continues with reports from Salesforce, Nvidia, , Best Buy and more. Here is a look at this week's earnings moves (links go to the Options AI Calendar / Expected move page, free to use):

TUESDAY

**Intuit** INTU / [Expected Move: **3%** ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/INTU)/ Recent moves: +4%, -4%, +2%

**Toll Brothers** TOL / [Expected Move: **6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/TOL) / Recent moves: +3%, -8%, -2%

**Nvidia** **NVDA /** [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NVDA)[ ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/WMT)**/** Recent moves: -8%, 0%, 0%

**Snowflake** SNOW / [Expected Move: **8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SNOW) / Recent moves: +1%, +16%

**Workday** WDAY / [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/WDAY)[ ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LMND)/ Recent moves: -2%, -9%, +12%

**Okta OKTA** / [Expected Move: **6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/okta) / Recent moves: -6%, +5%, -5%

THURSDAY

**Salesforce** CRM / [Expected Move: **5%** ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/CRM)/ Recent moves: -6%, -9%, +26%

**Best Buy** BBY / [Expected Move: **6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/BBY) / Recent moves: -9%, -7%, -4%

**Costco** COST/ [Expected Move: **3%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/COST) / Recent moves: -1%, +1%, -1%

**Autodesk** ADSK/ [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ADSK) / Recent moves: -3%, +5%, -2%

&#x200B;

The expected move can serve as a gut check for any existing position or new trade. Traders can also use the expected move for strike selection, with a comparison of a trade's breakeven vs the expected move an obvious indication of likelihood of success.

Here’s an example of using the expected move to generate an Iron Condor that “sells the move” in CRM. The Condor looks to profit if CRM stays within its expected move following earnings. It is a max gain between 212.50 and 232.50. If the stock moves beyond what options are pricing, the Condor is a max loss (with defined risk):

It's going right to the Salesforce, Inc door: CRM market is [estimated](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZRZBHDvnK) to reach $80 billion in revenues by 2025, growing at an average rate of 14% annually.

$XIGM.CN is $0,410 - and it’s just heading to the release. The current leader - Salesforce - CRM - is $180 per share.

iAgent is?…

They’ve raised the stakes at marketing and just launched a new website just for it [https://iagenttechnologies.com/](https://iagenttechnologies.com/)

iAgent is now aimed at small-to-medium enterprises to help them act more quickly on leads. SMEs are [estimated](https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/contributing-global-economy/discussion/foundation-economies-worldwide-small-business-0) to represent over 90% of all businesses, 60-70% of employment and 55% of GDP worldwide.

mdy17k_CRM,CRM,CRM salesforce price target for year end 2021,"Hey all,
Salesforcehas been beaten up since their Slack acquisition. I'm anticipating a retest of previous highs before the end of 2021 and have placed my bets accordingly. I'm long a 260 call with Jan 2022 expiration and have been selling 285 calls against it since purchase almost 60 days ago. My current cost basis for the call is $2100 making my break even 281. 

Based on current PE of crm it is trading at a 100 percent discount to it's 5 year average signaling a potential run to $400/ share is not out of the question.

Obviously hindsight is 20/20 and id love to get long the 260s from their current prices of like $900. But I'm still confident my bet will at the very least break even, especially with my call selling against it. How unrealistic are my expectations? Poke holes in my optimism.

m4meb2_CRM,CRM,What are your thoughts on Salesforce (CRM),"Been watching CRM for about a week. Did some digging on the stock because the price is 25% below it’s 52 wk high right now.

I’m not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I’ve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it’d be cool to ask y’all.

Bear Case:

- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. 

- Up about 40% 1 year (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)

- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel 

- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)

Bull Case:

- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  

- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. 

- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don’t remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.


I should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I’ve looked at; I’m not an expert so I wasn’t able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.

But yeah. Wondering what y’all think.

Just had a solid earnings rose 24% from a year earlier while revenue climbed 20% to $5.82 billion. Yet its still selling off, which in some fairness they got cucked and gave earnings last week while all of tech was telling off which I'm sure contributed to the negative price reaction.

They raised 2022 guidance and with the slack acquisition coming (I agree they overpaid, but not really), they are poised to take over even more market share than they have now - everyone and their mother's boyfriend uses SF in one form or another.

This thing continues to sell off and stick to its 3 month long 150MA channel which has formed a massive bull flag, since the Slack announcement. It has the largest market share in the cloud names and yet trades at the lowest PE ratio in the space.

kc11oa_CRM,CRM,SalesForce + Slack Arbitrage,"Hello Reddit,

I'm a rather new investor here, but could one not do an arbitrage deal with the merger?

The transaction between Salesforce and Slack is fairly straightforward. As part of the deal, Salesforce will pay to shareholders of Slack $26.79 per unit in cash. In addition to this, Slack’s investors will receive 0.0776 shares of common stock in Salesforce.

So therefore, the 1 Slack Stock = 26.79 + 0.0776 Salesforce stock.

Rn, 12/12/20

salesforce stock is: 222.42

Slack stock is: 42.24

&#x200B;

Left hand side (Slack stock price) - Right hand side (how much salesforce will pay you)

42.24 != 26.79 + 0.0776\*222.42

42.24 != 44.04

Could you not buy slack stock wait for the conversion and make an extra $2 per share due to the discrepancy? Wait a few months and you would automatically recover 26.79 of your investment.",2020-12-13,12,12

k6z2fs_CRM,CRM,"Listen retards, CRM should be your major easy-money move next week (fool-proof instructions inside)","**Basics**

Salesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

**What Happened**

This is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:

https://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2

The sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.

But Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.

So, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.

**What Happened Next**

After the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.

Jim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said ""Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.

Multiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.

Since then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.

Traders have a ""3-Day Rule"" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.

**What's Coming**

[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.

Also, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.

**What Positions**

Do NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):

\- 230C 12/18/2020

\- 250C End of year-February

\- 270C March-May 2021

\- 300C June-July 2021

\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.

**When to Buy**

Do not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.

I think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.

That said, we continue to view Salesforce as well positioned to capitalize on long-term secular tailwinds underpinning digital transformation efforts across industries and at current levels believe investor expectations remain somewhat muted. We continue to believe CRM represents one of the most strategic assets in software. We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $220.""

**Morgan Stanley:** ""CRM: Stable Demand Against Low Expectations Paves Way for Positive 2H21 Revisions. Recent rounds of checks with large SI partners of Salesforce suggest a better than feared demand environment given a broad, diversified product portfolio and stable renewal rates versus low expectations for the quarter. The headwinds to Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud picked up in our April quarter conversations continued into 2Q, as marketing budgets remain depressed and focus has shifted more towards efficiency projects instead of growth-oriented projects. That said, the tailwinds to Service Cloud and Commerce Cloud from work from home and shelter in place mandates, as well as strong demand trends for Mulesoft appear to have sustained through Q2. Looking ahead, partners expect a gradual recovery into Q3 and Q4, as digital transformation projects slowly begin to come back onto the priority list. This demand expectation contrasts favorably to management's more cautious guidance that assumes the spending environment does not improve until CY21 despite the better business trends seen in April and May, which leaves us confident in positive estimate revisions into 2HFY21 (relative to much of the software group where near-term expectations have proven too high to increase further with 2Q results). With shares lagging the broader software group YTD (+20% vs. the group +41% YTD) and trading at \~7.7x CY21e recurring revenue vs. the software group at \~13.4x, positive 2HFY21 estimate revisions and CRM's strong secular growth story seem underpriced at current levels, keeping us Overweight into results.""

**BMO:** "" Given conservative guidance, we think salesforce will meet and likely surpass consensus metrics for cRPO, billings, and revenues. While we are leaving our estimates unchanged, we are raising our target price to $230 and reiterate our Outperform rating. We continue to believe that salesforce may look at add to its capabilities and growth in FY22 through M&A, and we offer our thoughts on potential opportunities in monitoring and workflow, amongst other areas.""

**Jefferies:** ""Our survey of 50+ partners indicates 42% saw their CRM pipelines improve over the past three months; however, we are still not back to normal levels as 32% of partners were below plan (19% above and 51% below). The setup for F2Q looks attractive given the improving pipelines combined with a conservative guide. We believe that CRM is valued attractively at 7.6x EV/2021E rev vs group at 9.7x. Maintain Buy and raise PT to $235.""

**RBC:** "" Our checks suggest improving underlying business momentum. Given discounted valuation and increased likelihood of outperformance across most guided metrics, we like the risk/reward trade and raise our price target to $220 (from $210).""",2020-08-24,4,4
if2x8e_QCOM,QCOM,"This week's Unusual Options Flow into big tech, DLTR, LYFT, CZR, and CRM","Swaggy is back with his Sunday morning read of Unusual Options Activity. I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

As for unusual trades, it’s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I’ll get into the details of here.

**MSFT – Microsoft Corporation**

Microsoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it’s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.

**NVDA – NVIDIA Corporation**

NVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.

https://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563

**QCOM – QUALCOMM Incorporated**

QCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it’s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.

https://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56

**ORCL – Oracle Corporation**

ORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL’s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn’t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.

https://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7

**LYFT – Lyft Inc**

LYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I’m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it’s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309

**DLTR – Dollar Tree Inc**

Dollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren’t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We’ll see about this one.

https://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624

**CRM – Salesforce**

CRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.

**CZR – Caesars Entertainment Inc**

CZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it’s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it’s long-term bottom.

— **Pre-Market Summary** —

S&P futures posted a rare overnight drop alongside shares in Europe as President Trump’s moves to force China-owned TikTok into a sale of its U.S. operations drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, ratcheting up tensions as the world slides into a pandemic-fueled recession; at the same time a string of poor earnings illustrated the continuing hit from the pandemic while jittery investors also awaited news on whether fresh fiscal stimulus in the U.S. will get approval. The dollar reversed overnight losses and 10Y yields tumbled back to all time lows.

On Monday, the S&P 500 closed Monday within 3% of its all-time high, powered over the past four months by a stimulus-led rebound and a rally in tech-related stocks including Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. In earnings-related news, insurer AIG fell 2.8% in premarket trading after posting a 56% fall in quarterly adjusted earnings. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc O) rose 4.7% as it raised its annual adjusted sales forecast on demand for its videogame franchises “Grand Theft Auto” and “NBA 2K”. Rival Activision Blizzard Inc gained 3.8% ahead of its results due after the closing bell.

""We see U.S. stocks at risk of fading fiscal stimulus,"" BlackRock Investment Institute strategists led by Mike Pyle wrote in a note. “U.S. employment figures are in focus this week as this fiscal cliff nears and the pandemic’s spread in Sunbelt states is starting to affect economic activity.”

""Three months to go until the U.S. Presidential election! Surely Congress will want to get something over the line regarding new stimulus in the U.S. driven more by politics than necessarily economics,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.

* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head into another round of negotiations on a new virus relief package after talks on Monday yielded “a little bit” of progress
* With the talks dragging on, President Donald Trump on Monday said he was considering executive action to restore a moratorium on evictions that expired, and the White House was looking at other steps the administration could take without action by Congress
* China’s government may take action against Washington, if a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft Corp. is forced, the state-run China Daily said in an editorial
* California and Arizona reported fewer new coronavirus cases after battling a surge in infections last month, while Germany and Poland recorded increases

— **Trade Of The Day** —

Salesforce (CRM) has been [consolidating with the broader market for the past month and started to break out of its recent base](https://i.imgur.com/tmXqlIy.png) on Monday.

Here are two potential plays:

1. We've lost some edge on this entry but it should still persist into earnings, which are in the latter part of August. An entry at $203 would carry a stop-loss of $190/share. A Robinhood small account holder using a $1000 account with fractional shares would note that the gap between entry and ""stop"" is $13, which should represent a risk of no more than 2% to your account, which ends up being $20 of risk for a $1000 account. This $20 of risk on a $13 price move means that we'd use a 1.538 share size of CRM, using up $312 of capital, with a maximum risk figure of $20 to your account if you enforce the stop loss at $190. The price target would be a measured move to $220, so the reward-to-risk of this trade is 1.3 to 1.
2. Alternatively, you can trade a small options account with the leverage of 100 shares of CRM stock by using options. The CRM 4SEP 202.5/205 vertical debit call spread (buy the 202.5 & simultaneously sell the 205. [Here's how you'd set it up in Robinhood](https://i.imgur.com/3E9kWgp.png)) would be purchased for a maximum of $125/contract, which represents your max risk. This would require a $6250 account to keep the risk to 2% of your account, with a profit target of a 50% gain.

Why going through the bother of setting up a vertical spread position? Why not just buy the long put option? COST. Home runs are great but you can win more often with a lot of base hits, and that's what the vertical spread gets you.

Besides, there are companies where cloud computing is only a business unit, among others (Microsoft; Amazon; Tencent; IBM) and other companies that mainly do cloud computing (Oracle; Shopify; Salesforce). 

That is why I conducted a fundamental analysis ( [(click here if you want)](https://theeuropeanview.com/best-winner-stocks-for-cloud-computing/#more-2153) ) of the market and examined the individual players according to their multiples.

I’ve never had a call (or a put) actually executed before. If it opens at 157.5+ Should I just allow them both to execute? I would then sell my held shares for 155 leaving the difference on the table, and be able to re-buy at 155, resetting my capital gains to short at 155 but also be ahead by a few dollars a share?

c1uf7o_CRM,CRM,CRM Tomorrow At Open,"If you follow my posts and suggestions you'll know that I'm right a lot on big bets. Week before last week and last week I was preaching FB calls. If you listened, congrats. 

Cool thing about the market is that there are opportunities everywhere. This week is big for stocks with fed meeting tues and wed. Personally, I think Powell will continue to be dovish but rates won't be cut. Overall market effect will be rally. If rates cut, effect will be rally. He wouldn't dare be hawkish, so I think we're safe with calls. However, some stocks are safer than others.

CRM is one of the safest because it has yet to recover to even close to its post earnings level, which was a great earnings report. The double whammy of unrelated antitrust news (which arguably affects FB more than anyone and look at them) and the DATA acquisition pushed the stock down. It has been consolidating for a week, being accumulated, and it's nearly ready to take off to near its old levels in the 160s.

A more conservative estimate is mid 150s, which I think could be the extent of its short term recovery, but am leaning more towards high 150s low 160s recovery over the next week. These estimates I believe will come to pass regardless of fed meeting.

So get your CRM calls soon. I am loading more tomorrow morning just in case, but tomorrow could be another consolidation day with little movement.",2019-06-17,51,73

trades at $287.5

2 year calls @140 are 138.7 

Now, lets assume SPY goes up 15% to 330.625

These make the calls cost $13,870 (plus the 4% in lost divs make the calls cost $15,250- I'm using 4% of 330.62 as the lost divs, thereby highballing)

The cost to exercise is 14K+15,250, and the profit is $3870.

If I had instead put that $15,250 into stocks (rounded down), I'd have bought 52 stocks and made $2242. 

The difference between DITM leverage and stocks is 72.57% or $1627


CRM:

trades at $157.65

Now, lets assume CRM goes up 15% to 181

21mo calls @80 are $84.15 *so $8415) if i take the middle of the bid/ask per the calculator online. The interest here is a mere 2.63%, or 4% when compared to just buying 100 stocks.

The cost to exercise is 8415+8000 is  $16,415, and the profit is $1714.75

If I had instead put 8415 into 53 stocks, the profit would be $1253.31. 

The difference between the DITM and the stocks is 36.8%, or $461.43



Why is SPY so much more profitable as leverage? Obviously the spread is more favorable, but you lose 4% on SPY divs... the CRM interest is less than the divs alone....?

In order to the crm option to match SPY's leverage difference at 15%, crm needs to go up 50%, and to match SPY's profit, it has to go up 20% (assuming i buy 2 crm contracts instead of 1 spy, since its roughly half the price.) 

Where is my math wrong? or what's the logic I'm oblivious to? I like crm, but I don't know that I'm confident enough that it'll out-average the market by over 5% to breakeven + whatever % makes it worth the risk. ",2019-03-12,2,4

92lojv_CRM,CRM,"If you thought the FB drop was bad, wait until everybody learns about what's been going on with Salesforce","Let's forget for a minute that going into this, $CRM was already the most atrociously overvalued company in the market. Who or whatever has pumped $10 Billion of fake value into this company over the last month or two is obviously insane.  GAAP earnings are being swept under the rug, and the accounting people are making up EPS numbers as they go.  

There is no justification for this kind of market cap ($110 Billion now?) for a company that literally has no appreciable assets, no reason for its customers to not switch to cheaper or better alternatives.  It should have flat to negative forecasting, not these baloney numbers it comes up with.  Whoever buys this stock as an investment obviously has NO EXPERIENCE WITH SOFTWARE.  Anybody who has worked in the industry knows: the more software you add to software, the bulkier and more complex and expensive it gets to manage.  You're not paying for the ""software"" you're paying for the ""service"" of waiting in line to get service.  Anybody using CRM is literally paying that company to manage its own unwieldy complexity.  Customers are paying what is probably a 50X premium for something that doesn't deserve a 50X premium.

On the balance sheet, its intangible assets are something like 40+ billion? That is NOT COUNTING SHAREHOLDER EQUITY.  Remember the accounting equation?  

""Assets = Liabilites + Owners' Equity""

The assets piece is being manipulated and false information is being presented to shareholders.  EPS numbers touted are not GAAP compliant; instead they are reporting past revenue as current revenue (accounting tricks), and forecasting future revenue based on that already false premise.  

Also look at its short-term debt obligations, which are already ridiculous (90-something percent of its intangibles).  And yet, it somehow manages to get way below market-rate loans courtesy of JP Morgan so it can do ""acquisitions"" of companies and pay the founders of those companies worthless stock. The CEO and executive insiders then proceed to dump hundreds of millions of dollars in stock per week.  

To put it in the words of one redditor 

> ""We're also moving away from Salesforce, but mostly because it's shit and their API is even shittier.""

So let's presume that this $10B has been because of its coziness and taking taxpayer money in deals with the Trump administration to [cage humans and enforce the highly controversial CBP](https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-faces-boycott-threat-as-raices-rejects-250-1827701407).  

True market cap is probably $15-18 Billion on its best day.  Salesforce needs to be punished severely by people who can do math and prove its business model is a fraud. ",2018-07-28,0,26

# Description
salesforce.com, inc. is a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management (CRM). The Company's Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, etc. 

So why buy Twitter? Here's that [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-m-a-salesforce-com-idUSKCN12A2B2) says:

> Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.

Now odd that that might seem, remember that we the user of Google are not the ""customers"". The advertisers are the customers. So perhaps there is method in the madness?

## Recent financials 

It's really hard to not be impressed by a top line like CRM's! And given it's a ""cloud"" business with a ""SaaS"" model, the momentum should run. Why? folks are signing up for monthly subscriptions and they just seem to never go cancelling them in the software space.

|Jan year-end |2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.7bn | $5.4bn | $4.1bn | $3.1bn | $2.3bn|
|EPS | -$0.07 | -$0.42 | -$0.39 | -$0.48 | -$0.02|

Of course, it's troubling that the company hasn't turned a profit in the last 5 years, but here's to a first in the year to Jan 2017!

## Competition

Talking about the competition, Salesforce highlights:

> We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services. 

Though one of the competitive risks they highlight is actual a strength of there own!

> Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service.

i.e. like a lot of software based services, once you've got the client they are loathed to leave.

And how does this show on in the financials, well the old men of Enterprise technology (MSFT, ORCL, SAP) enjoy little growth but great returns and margins. But the new kids, CRM, WDAY, NOW have the growth but little margin or return.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
salesforce.com, inc. | $7,475M | 8% | 4%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,320M | 33% | 22%
Oracle Corporation | $37,194M | 42% | 19%
SAP SE (ADR) | $23,533M | 32% | 16%
Intuit Inc. | $4,694M | 32% | 46%
Workday Inc | $1,352M | -15% | -31%
ServiceNow Inc | $1,194M | -8% | -117%

## Cash / Debt?

If we look at salesforce's balance sheet we can see it has $1,340M of net debt. That is 2.2x it's latest operating profit. So it's a $50bn market value business with quite a bit of debt on it's books and it's considering a bid for TWTR a $13bn value business (though $2bn of that is cash).

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $93.51 for salesforce.com, inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 29% to their target.

# Valuation

I've always struggled to value the highflying SaaS businesses. The regular metrics just don't give any comfort. And if I switch to price-to-sales I still get faced with CRM on 6x forward sales versus MSFT/ORCL on 4x. So where's the comfort there?

And I can't even hang my hat on the earnings the year after next :( With a [forecast](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=CRM.N) of $0.95 this year and just $1.27 the year after. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/crm/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CRM | $49,608M | 76x | 30% | 0% | 1%
MSFT.O | $445,654M | 20x | 9% | 3% | 8%
ORCL.K | $156,056M | 14x | 8% | 2% | 9%
SAP | $110,016M | 21x | 11% | 1% | 6%
INTU.O | $27,597M | 25x | 17% | 1% | 5%
WDAY.K | $17,570M | -ve | 38% | 0% | -ve
NOW | $12,963M | 120x | 44% | 0% | -ve

To try and justify the valuation you need to dig into the cashflow statement and drink from the SaaS KoolAid. For example on the managements 2Q results they talked about:

> our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21% which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. 

Now 25x cashflow doesn't look ""hideous"" for a business growing like CRM... but if you start looking at the way that figure is calculated, I expect you'll be surprised to see Depreciation > capex, half of the figure coming in deferred revenue, and a substantial % from stock-options-plan adjustments.

# Dividends
You won't be surprised that salesforce.com, inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. 

Though in share contrast to the big caps who like doing share buybacks, the number of share in circulation at CRM is up substantially in each of the last 5 years. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -11% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. The backdrop has been continued double digit top line growth at 26% in the first 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they raised guidance for sales, expressed confidence in their margin, spoke of an exciting new set of products (e.g. Einstein), strong cashflows and much more.

In the near-term it's hard to see any catalyst other than the rumor mill round Twitter. And binary outcomes are a horrible environment to take a position in. You'll either feel like a hero or get hammered. 

For me, it's one to sit out. Unless of course the stock get's hammered, with investors throwing the baby out with the bathwater!

2wst8n_CRM,CRM,Planning to buy $CRM. Any thoughts about the stock?,"edit: NYSE:CRM, a.k.a. Salesforce

If I look at the last 5 years performance prior to 2014 it has been consistently raised roughly around %20 a year. Company is valued around ~$40b (though only one tenth of it is equity) and $4b revenues per year. I know that they do not have much net income as they invest every penny they earn into R&D, which is not unheard of in this sector.

What I am curious is whether it's growth is the issue here or not. In 2014 it pretty much went nowhere except for some fluctuations despite %33 growth in its revenues. Looking into the past I do not see much difference. So I have two theories:

1. With the fear of possible decline of growth investors are worried and are being cautious. In this case fitting to previous model it's stock price could have been $75 per share.

2. It's growth really is to be stagnated, in which it is incredibly surprising the price can still roam around ~$60s. I recall worries of growth in facebook turned the stock from $38 to $17 in mere months, yet here I do not see such panic sell off.

I am a bit lost here and wanted to consult to wisdom of crowds.
