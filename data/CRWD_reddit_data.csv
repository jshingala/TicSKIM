1kfemtf_CRWD,CRWD,Selling Crowdstrike for Nvidia?,"
I purchased Crowdstrike at $170 a share and now have around $50K in Crowdstrike shares. 

Considering Crowdstrike is heavily overvalued (despite excellent potential) and near its all time high, and NVIDIA is trading at a discount from its all time high, what do you all think about selling a significant portion of my CRWD for NVIDIA? I’m thinking about maybe 40-50%? Considering how fast Crowdstrike slipped with the tariff situation as well as with the whole outage fiasco last year makes me worried that it’s a vulnerable stock, especially because I expect investors to focus on value based stocks if the U.S. heads into a recession. 

Additional info: portfolio is otherwise diverse enough to my liking, so I’m not really looking for comments about how I should diversify more. Just looking for a direct answer or discussion to my question (sorry if that sounds harsh, I’m just a direct guy who knows what he wants). ",2025-05-05,9,52

# Uber and Waymo Begin Driverless Ridehailing Service in Austin

**Self-driving rides are here—just don’t expect them everywhere yet.**

Austin just became the latest testing ground for driverless ride-hailing, with Uber and Waymo launching their autonomous taxi service this week. Riders booking an UberX, Uber Green, Comfort, or Comfort Electric trip (I just book whatever’s the cheapest) could find themselves inside a Waymo self-driving Jaguar at no extra charge—if they opt in. For now, the service covers 37 square miles, including downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, with Uber managing the fleet.

**SXSW Test Drive**  
  
The timing couldn’t be better. With 300,000 people flooding Austin for South by Southwest (SXSW), Waymo has a prime opportunity to showcase its tech to a massive audience. Uber already offers Waymo rides in Phoenix, but Austin marks the first city where it’s fully managing Waymo’s fleet—handling everything from cleaning to charging, with an expansion to Atlanta set for later this year.

  
Elon Musk has his sights on the same market. Tesla plans to launch its own driverless ride-hailing service in Austin by June, setting up a head-to-head battle with Waymo and Uber. Unlike Waymo, Tesla’s system still requires a human backup driver—so whether it can truly compete in the fully autonomous space remains to be seen.

**Who’s Really Winning the Robotaxi Race?**  
  
Waymo is already dominating the self-driving ride scene, reportedly handling 200,000 trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. Tesla, meanwhile, is still perfecting its AI-assisted driving tech, while Lyft has all but abandoned its own autonomous ambitions. For now, Waymo’s biggest competitor might just be human drivers who still do most of Uber’s work.

**The Road Ahead:** The real test is whether people actually want driverless rides. While Waymo’s service is expanding, safety concerns and regulatory hurdles remain. If Austin’s launch goes smoothly, expect more cities to follow. If not? Well, human drivers aren’t going anywhere just yet.

# Echelon Of Earnings From CrowdStrike, Marvell, MongoDB, Abercrombie & Fitch And Foot Locker

**CrowdStrike** took a nosedive, falling 6.34%, as a weak earnings forecast overshadowed solid quarterly results. The cybersecurity firm has been clawing back from last year’s disastrous software update that bricked computers worldwide, but its forward guidance left investors unimpressed. CEO George Kurtz tried to reassure investors, saying growth will pick up in the second half of the year, but Wall Street wasn’t buying it. ($CRWD)

**Marvell Technology** sank 14.85% as investors realized that AI-fueled growth wasn’t moving as fast as they’d hoped.The chipmaker’s revenue forecast was in line with expectations, but some had been hoping for even bigger numbers. Given the recent AI stock pullback, Marvell’s cautious outlook only added to the sector’s jitters. Broadcom, another AI chip player, fell 3.5% in sympathy. ($MRVL)

**MongoDB** tanked 16.11% in after-hours trading after its weak guidance sent investors scrambling. The database software firm had strong revenue growth last quarter, but its outlook for the full year suggests the party may be winding down. MongoDB blamed slower adoption of its Atlas cloud service, but that didn’t stop Wall Street from heading for the exits. ($MDB)

**Abercrombie & Fitch** plunged 9.24% as investors decided its hot streak might be cooling off. The retailer has been a rare comeback story, nailing trends and expanding its customer base beyond teenagers. But its 2025 revenue forecast came in weaker than expected, and with Trump tariffs looming, investors are skittish about the stock’s ability to keep up its run. ($ANF)

**Foot Locker** surged 5.12% after the company reassured investors that its exposure to tariffs would be limited.While the sneaker retailer still faces pressures from Nike’s direct-to-consumer push and a highly promotional retail environment, it managed to beat sales estimates last quarter. Foot Locker also laid out plans to cut costs and revamp its stores, which seems to have given investors something to cheer about. ($FL)

# Tomorrow

The labor market took a hit in today’s ADP report, and there’s more jobs data on deck tomorrow with the latest batch of initial jobless claims. Traders will also be eyeing updates on the US trade deficit and wholesale inventories for clues on how the manufacturing sector is holding up.

Earnings season rolls on with fresh reports from some big names, including Macy’s ($M), Broadcom ($AVGO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise ($HPE), Kroger ($KR), JD .com ($JD), The Gap ($GPS), and Cracker Barrel ($CBRL).

# After Market Close:

* **Costco** remains the undisputed champion of wholesale retail, winning over both shoppers and shareholders with its rock-solid management and cash-rich balance sheet. Whether the economy is booming or stumbling, Costco thrives by offering bulk bargains that keep customers coming back—especially with tariff tensions pushing more shoppers toward cost-cutting strategies. The only real knock? Its stock price has surged, leaving limited room for upside based on Wall Street’s targets.

# Echelon Of Earnings From CrowdStrike, Marvell, MongoDB, Abercrombie & Fitch And Foot Locker

**CrowdStrike** took a nosedive, falling 6.34%, as a weak earnings forecast overshadowed solid quarterly results. The cybersecurity firm has been clawing back from last year’s disastrous software update that bricked computers worldwide, but its forward guidance left investors unimpressed. CEO George Kurtz tried to reassure investors, saying growth will pick up in the second half of the year, but Wall Street wasn’t buying it. ($CRWD)

**Marvell Technology** sank 14.85% as investors realized that AI-fueled growth wasn’t moving as fast as they’d hoped.The chipmaker’s revenue forecast was in line with expectations, but some had been hoping for even bigger numbers.

**MongoDB** tanked 16.11% in after-hours trading after its weak guidance sent investors scrambling. The database software firm had strong revenue growth last quarter, but its outlook for the full year suggests the party may be winding down. MongoDB blamed slower adoption of its Atlas cloud service, but that didn’t stop Wall Street from heading for the exits. ($MDB)

**Abercrombie & Fitch** plunged 9.24% as investors decided its hot streak might be cooling off. The retailer has been a rare comeback story, nailing trends and expanding its customer base beyond teenagers.

**Foot Locker** surged 5.12% after the company reassured investors that its exposure to tariffs would be limited.While the sneaker retailer still faces pressures from Nike’s direct-to-consumer push and a highly promotional retail environment, it managed to beat sales estimates last quarter.

# Uber and Waymo Begin Driverless Ridehailing Service in Austin

**Self-driving rides are here—just don’t expect them everywhere yet.**

Austin just became the latest testing ground for driverless ride-hailing, with Uber and Waymo launching their autonomous taxi service this week. Riders booking an UberX, Uber Green, Comfort, or Comfort Electric trip (I just book whatever’s the cheapest) could find themselves inside a Waymo self-driving Jaguar at no extra charge—if they opt in. For now, the service covers 37 square miles, including downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, with Uber managing the fleet.

**SXSW Test Drive**  
  
The timing couldn’t be better. With 300,000 people flooding Austin for South by Southwest (SXSW), Waymo has a prime opportunity to showcase its tech to a massive audience. Uber already offers Waymo rides in Phoenix, but Austin marks the first city where it’s fully managing Waymo’s fleet—handling everything from cleaning to charging, with an expansion to Atlanta set for later this year.

  
Elon Musk has his sights on the same market. Tesla plans to launch its own driverless ride-hailing service in Austin by June, setting up a head-to-head battle with Waymo and Uber. Unlike Waymo, Tesla’s system still requires a human backup driver—so whether it can truly compete in the fully autonomous space remains to be seen.

**Who’s Really Winning the Robotaxi Race?**  
  
Waymo is already dominating the self-driving ride scene, reportedly handling 200,000 trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. Tesla, meanwhile, is still perfecting its AI-assisted driving tech, while Lyft has all but abandoned its own autonomous ambitions. For now, Waymo’s biggest competitor might just be human drivers who still do most of Uber’s work.

**The Road Ahead:** The real test is whether people actually want driverless rides. While Waymo’s service is expanding, safety concerns and regulatory hurdles remain. If Austin’s launch goes smoothly, expect more cities to follow. If not? Well, human drivers aren’t going anywhere just yet.

# Echelon Of Earnings From CrowdStrike, Marvell, MongoDB, Abercrombie & Fitch And Foot Locker

**CrowdStrike** took a nosedive, falling 6.34%, as a weak earnings forecast overshadowed solid quarterly results. The cybersecurity firm has been clawing back from last year’s disastrous software update that bricked computers worldwide, but its forward guidance left investors unimpressed. CEO George Kurtz tried to reassure investors, saying growth will pick up in the second half of the year, but Wall Street wasn’t buying it. ($CRWD)

**Marvell Technology** sank 14.85% as investors realized that AI-fueled growth wasn’t moving as fast as they’d hoped.The chipmaker’s revenue forecast was in line with expectations, but some had been hoping for even bigger numbers. Given the recent AI stock pullback, Marvell’s cautious outlook only added to the sector’s jitters. Broadcom, another AI chip player, fell 3.5% in sympathy. ($MRVL)

**MongoDB** tanked 16.11% in after-hours trading after its weak guidance sent investors scrambling. The database software firm had strong revenue growth last quarter, but its outlook for the full year suggests the party may be winding down. MongoDB blamed slower adoption of its Atlas cloud service, but that didn’t stop Wall Street from heading for the exits. ($MDB)

**Abercrombie & Fitch** plunged 9.24% as investors decided its hot streak might be cooling off. The retailer has been a rare comeback story, nailing trends and expanding its customer base beyond teenagers. But its 2025 revenue forecast came in weaker than expected, and with Trump tariffs looming, investors are skittish about the stock’s ability to keep up its run. ($ANF)

**Foot Locker** surged 5.12% after the company reassured investors that its exposure to tariffs would be limited.While the sneaker retailer still faces pressures from Nike’s direct-to-consumer push and a highly promotional retail environment, it managed to beat sales estimates last quarter. Foot Locker also laid out plans to cut costs and revamp its stores, which seems to have given investors something to cheer about. ($FL)

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The labor market took a hit in today’s ADP report, and there’s more jobs data on deck tomorrow with the latest batch of initial jobless claims. Traders will also be eyeing updates on the US trade deficit and wholesale inventories for clues on how the manufacturing sector is holding up.

Earnings season rolls on with fresh reports from some big names, including Macy’s ($M), Broadcom ($AVGO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise ($HPE), Kroger ($KR), JD .com ($JD), The Gap ($GPS), and Cracker Barrel ($CBRL).

# After Market Close:

* **Costco** remains the undisputed champion of wholesale retail, winning over both shoppers and shareholders with its rock-solid management and cash-rich balance sheet. Whether the economy is booming or stumbling, Costco thrives by offering bulk bargains that keep customers coming back—especially with tariff tensions pushing more shoppers toward cost-cutting strategies. The only real knock? Its stock price has surged, leaving limited room for upside based on Wall Street’s targets. Investors still love the business, but with shares closing in on analyst expectations, Costco may need a surprise beat to keep the rally rolling. ($COST) ",2025-03-06,1,0

That topped the $4.21 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by StreetAccount and included $224 million in net annual recurring revenue.

Revenue guidance was roughly in line with estimates. CrowdStrike said it expects revenue of between $4.74 billion and $4.81 billion for the year, versus an LSEG estimate of $4.77 billion.

The earnings release comes almost eight months after a technology update from the company led to a global IT outage that grounded flights, disrupted businesses and led to class action lawsuits.

CEO George Kurtz said in the press release that artificial intelligence is becoming more important in stopping cyberattacks.

“As businesses of all sizes rapidly adopt AI, stopping the breach necessitates cybersecurity’s AI-native platform,” Kurtz said.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",2024-08-31,5,1

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",2024-08-31,5,1

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.

1f3juog_CRWD,CRWD,CrowdStrike beats quarterly consensus but lowers full-year guidance,"CrowdStrike shares rose 4% in extended trading on Wednesday after the cybersecurity software maker reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but reduced full-year guidance in the wake of a global outage.

Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.04 adjusted vs. 97 cents expected

Revenue: $963.9 million vs. $959 million expected

CrowdStrike’s revenue grew 32% year over year in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. The company recorded net income of $47 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $8.47 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Annual recurring revenue was $3.86 billion, just above the StreetAccount consensus of $3.85 billion.

On July 19, CrowdStrike distributed a flawed content configuration update for its Falcon sensor to computers running Microsoft
 Windows operating systems, with the intent to gather data on new attacks. The error caused millions of computers to crash, leading to flight cancelations, delayed packaged deliveries and postponed medical appointments. Administrators had to manually reboot affected computers.

CEO George Kurtz apologized to clients and partners and said the company had rolled out a fix. Meanwhile, investors were pushing down CrowdStrike’s share price. Shareholders have filed suit against the company, and Delta Air Lines
, which cited $380 million in lost revenue and $170 million in costs because of the incident, said it will seek damages. Travelers have filed class-action suits against the CrowdStrike as well.

“All customers are looking for some kind of discount,” Gray Powell and Trevor Rambo of BTIG, with the equivalent of a hold rating on CrowdStrike shares, wrote in an Aug. 23 note.

With respect to guidance, CrowdStrike called for adjusted net earnings of 80 cents to 81 cents per share on $979.2 million to $984.7 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for 96 cents in adjusted net earnings per share on $1.01 billion in revenue.

For the 2025 fiscal year, CrowdStrike now sees $3.61 to $3.65 in adjusted earnings per share and $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion in revenue. That’s down from management’s June forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.03 and revenue between $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected adjusted profit of $3.88 per share, with $3.95 billion in revenue.

The full-year revenue guidance includes a negative subscription revenue impact of $30 million in each quarter and professional services revenue in the high-single-digit millions of dollars for the second half of the fiscal year, because of incentives for a customer commitment package, according to the statement. The adjusted guidance excludes costs related to the outage, CrowdStrike said.

Before CrowdStrike issued the earnings report, its stock was up about 4% this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% over that period.

Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/crowdstrike-crwd-q2-earnings-report-2025.html",2024-08-28,57,20
1f1uitc_CRWD,CRWD,CRWD,"I’m not sure if this kinda thing is allowed to be posted or not, apologies if not. I’m just genuinely curious of people’s thoughts on Crowdstrikes upcoming earnings whether the price will go up or down. I know it’s “going to go up or down” and all the other typical sayings but due to the July 19 incident, I’m wondering if the price already adjusted. My personal prediction is that it’ll go down, but I have a wonderful habit of being wrong. ",2024-08-26,6,13
1etu5kb_PANW,PANW,"After the CRWD Outage, who will win the Cybersecurity War?","I’ve been trying to come to this conclusion but I can’t quite figure it out. I’ve been trying to compare Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Palo Alto and Fortinet. 

- CRWD currently provides the best endpoint security software out there at the moment from what I’ve read, if you’re a larger organisation, it’s the most secure easy to use product. They don’t deal with smaller businesses though. Their growth has been crazy, they’re finally turning a profit and seem to offer the best software. I wouldn’t say they have a moat though, but from what I hear, switching security provider is a massive ball ache and takes a shit load of work, it’s not like cancelling one subscription and starting another. This would potentially keep customers who are already using crowdstrike to stick around instead of just jumping ship after the outage, because the time/effort/risk just wouldn’t be worth it. A lot of their customers are also in fairly long term contracts with them so it would give CRWD enough time to appease their customers enough to repair their reputation with the customers they already have. 

The pitfall I see though is that they have a CRAZY PE ratio relative to others in the sector, which from my understanding is entirely fuelled by the bonkers growth they’ve been having. There were signs growth was slowing down a tad anyway, and after the outage, potential customers who were looking for a cybersecurity product might start choosing other companies over them because of the bad mark it’s left on their reputation, which would slow growth down a lot, which would then in turn make the crazy high PE house of cards collapse and they tank. Still though, I’m not sure whether the outage would be enough to deter a meaningful amount of prospective customers away from choosing CRWD. 
One one hand, you could say it was just an accident, they dealt with it pretty well and you could argue that they sure as fuck won’t let this happen again. But then on the other, you could argue that it’s an indicator into them having bad business practices, you’d think that’d be some sort of company policy that before launching a worldwide update, that they’d atleast test it first on a virtual machine to check that it’s not going to cause any issues.

So I’m at a crossroads with CRWD, I can’t tell whether it’s crazy good value and they’ll recover just fine from the fiasco and continue a crazy rally, or whether this has stopped their bonkers growth in its tracks, which sends the stock plummeting. 

- SentinelOne is cheaper and appeals slightly more to smaller companies (when I say smaller, I just mean not mega companies). Their products from what I read aren’t as good, can be a bit more finnicky to use, has a few small issues with it like detecting false positives and shit. Nothing crazy or bad, but it seems to be a slightly less polished product. They are however cheaper, and unlike CRWD, they deal with small businesses aswell as mega companies, although I don’t think SentinelOne has nearly as many giant customers as CRWD has. I read somewhere that they currently have something like 1,100 customers that spend over 100k a year with them. Although from scrolling through discussions about SentinelOne in sysadmin type subreddits, SentinelOne has been bringing new updates, and their CEO has publicly said that Crowdstrike is their biggest competitor, it seems like whatever Crowdstrike does, SentinelOne tries to rival it. So if Crowdstrike ends up losing market share after the outage, SentinelOne could be there to scoop up a big chunk of CRWDs market share. However, they are currently not profitable, although they have been growing year on year and they are on track to become profitable, which gives them a potential growth party train on the horizon if they keep at it. However, they still aren’t the favourite product like Crowdstrike is, they still aren’t profitable yet and they don’t particularly have a moat either. 

I haven’t read as much into Palo Alto and Fortinet, but from what I have read, Palo Alto is an already big established and trusted name, it’d good enough for the US military and they aren’t an underdog, but they are more about firewalls instead of endpoint protection, so a potential Crowdstrike customer couldn’t get a similar product from Palo Alto. They’re still growing, but it seems like their growth could be seeing a noticeable slowdown. And as for Fortinet, it seems as though it’s just not a preferred product over what SentinelOne or Crowdstrike have to offer, they similarly have no moat and they’re seemingly the sort of underdog of this big pack. They’re still a big name, but the underdog out of the names I’ve listed. To be honest though, I haven’t done much research into them. Their name also sounds like fortnite. 

I can’t be assed to carry on for any longer because I’m sat on the toilet and my legs have gone numb by this point. I’m regarded and frankly haven’t got a clue about cybersecurity. What do you think about it? Will Crowdstrike still maintain the top spot for endpoint security and will they maintain the same growth even after the outage, or has it maimed their future growth a bit, opening the door for a competitor to swoop in and take up a load of market share?

I’m currently bullish on SentinelOne, more so than I am for CrowdStrike. I don’t know though because I eat crayons and I’ve mentally discarded the idea of investing in Fortinet because it looks like fortnite, and PANW is expensive. ",2024-08-16,27,39
1etu5kb_CRWD,CRWD,"After the CRWD Outage, who will win the Cybersecurity War?","I’ve been trying to come to this conclusion but I can’t quite figure it out. I’ve been trying to compare Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Palo Alto and Fortinet. 

- CRWD currently provides the best endpoint security software out there at the moment from what I’ve read, if you’re a larger organisation, it’s the most secure easy to use product. They don’t deal with smaller businesses though. Their growth has been crazy, they’re finally turning a profit and seem to offer the best software. I wouldn’t say they have a moat though, but from what I hear, switching security provider is a massive ball ache and takes a shit load of work, it’s not like cancelling one subscription and starting another. This would potentially keep customers who are already using crowdstrike to stick around instead of just jumping ship after the outage, because the time/effort/risk just wouldn’t be worth it. A lot of their customers are also in fairly long term contracts with them so it would give CRWD enough time to appease their customers enough to repair their reputation with the customers they already have. 

The pitfall I see though is that they have a CRAZY PE ratio relative to others in the sector, which from my understanding is entirely fuelled by the bonkers growth they’ve been having. There were signs growth was slowing down a tad anyway, and after the outage, potential customers who were looking for a cybersecurity product might start choosing other companies over them because of the bad mark it’s left on their reputation, which would slow growth down a lot, which would then in turn make the crazy high PE house of cards collapse and they tank. Still though, I’m not sure whether the outage would be enough to deter a meaningful amount of prospective customers away from choosing CRWD. 
One one hand, you could say it was just an accident, they dealt with it pretty well and you could argue that they sure as fuck won’t let this happen again. But then on the other, you could argue that it’s an indicator into them having bad business practices, you’d think that’d be some sort of company policy that before launching a worldwide update, that they’d atleast test it first on a virtual machine to check that it’s not going to cause any issues.

So I’m at a crossroads with CRWD, I can’t tell whether it’s crazy good value and they’ll recover just fine from the fiasco and continue a crazy rally, or whether this has stopped their bonkers growth in its tracks, which sends the stock plummeting. 

- SentinelOne is cheaper and appeals slightly more to smaller companies (when I say smaller, I just mean not mega companies). Their products from what I read aren’t as good, can be a bit more finnicky to use, has a few small issues with it like detecting false positives and shit. Nothing crazy or bad, but it seems to be a slightly less polished product. They are however cheaper, and unlike CRWD, they deal with small businesses aswell as mega companies, although I don’t think SentinelOne has nearly as many giant customers as CRWD has. I read somewhere that they currently have something like 1,100 customers that spend over 100k a year with them. Although from scrolling through discussions about SentinelOne in sysadmin type subreddits, SentinelOne has been bringing new updates, and their CEO has publicly said that Crowdstrike is their biggest competitor, it seems like whatever Crowdstrike does, SentinelOne tries to rival it. So if Crowdstrike ends up losing market share after the outage, SentinelOne could be there to scoop up a big chunk of CRWDs market share. However, they are currently not profitable, although they have been growing year on year and they are on track to become profitable, which gives them a potential growth party train on the horizon if they keep at it. However, they still aren’t the favourite product like Crowdstrike is, they still aren’t profitable yet and they don’t particularly have a moat either.

However, CrowdStrike is highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that it acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed willful misconduct.""



Carlinsky said CrowdStrike reached out to Delta within hours of the incident to offer assistance, after which CEO George Kurtz personally reached out to Delta's chief Ed Bastian, but received no response.""CrowdStrike  followed up with Delta  on the offer, and was told that the onsite resources were not needed,"" Carlinsky noted.He said Delta's public threat of litigation ""contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike  is responsible for Delta's IT decisions and response to the outage,"" and pointed to the fact that other airlines recovered from the IT meltdown much faster.



Carlinsky said any liability by CrowdStrike is ""contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions… while litigation would be unfortunate, CrowdStrike will respond aggressively, if forced to do so.""Bastian recently said the impact from the IT outage would cost the airline $500 million.

1ecbao0_CRWD,CRWD,Thoughts on Crowdstrike bottoming out,"I know Crowdstrike is like catching a falling knife right now. Since last week the stock has dropped 18% to $254. Not a major sale but at a certain point the stock becomes attractive again.

My main question is when is a good time to start building a small position? What are some red and yellow flags to look out for?

The obvious ones are potential lawsuits/liabilities from F500 companies. Which is very hard to price. So I do see the stock going below $200 over the next six months. Maybe creating an interesting opportunity to also write calls and buy LEAPs. Either way, I need help working through worst-case scenarios for the stock price.

Right now I think the EBITDA multiple is way too rich (165x). Since the stock recently achieved profitability,  I think any potential lawsuits will wipe out near-term profits. Which means the stock will be in the red for the next 2-3 quarters.

High level I think an entry price can be around $180 before year-end. My bullish reasoning for the stock is that last week was a software glitch, not a security incident. Black swan events like this happen to even the best companies. But if Crowdstrike encountered a cybersecurity attack, this stock will drop by 50% and be forgotten.

Let me know what you think the downsides might be and how you would price them.

Look at the UNH hack earlier this year, or the Morgan investigation, or Boeing etc etc. 

  
This was a fuck up on processes at CRWD, but it does not invalidate their entire product suite, and how entrenched they are in most companies. Most institutions will take months to plan to **possibly replace** them, and then research competitors, hear their pitch and then **ultimately decide** no one is at the same level of CRWD and decide to stay but ask for more stringent roll out process, CAPA and all other useless corporate documentation. 

  
Those who decide to move from them, are not doing it overnight, it will take months to years and is extremely expensive. It will take months of effort to move to a different vendor, a lot of retraining of staff, and a bunch of other expensive activities

  
So if you are sitting there thinking this stock is going to 0, you will be fucked. At least wait for quarterly guidance to decide on buying shorts and be realistic.

1ea75vl_MSFT,MSFT,CRWD is going to die.,"Im sure you all saw that video of the microsoft dev telling us why the bug happened. If you havent, Crowdstrike is a virus/malware security company that packaged their program as a ""driver"", so they have access to the kernel. On top of that its a bootable driver, so it loads as soon as you turn on the computer. I cant speak for all drivers, but at least in the case of NVDA driver updates to graphics cards, they have to go through Microsoft testing, which is done by Microsoft to determine it is functional and doesnt cause any issues before providing a certificate to let that driver be published. 

As for Crowdstrike, being the incredibly fast and up to the minute protection, they dont have time to do a certificate test to get an approval from microsoft, so they change 1 text file, and push it to all of the machines using their driver. Well on friday, we all saw that driver failed to boot due to an error in the text file. I believe it was a file full of 0's?

Blame the EU for allowing Kernel access in the first place, as they didnt want MSFT to have a monopoly on a virus protector. 

What could very well happen in the long term is Crowdstrike will get their kernel access removed, or be required to update their certificate every time they have an update. **Getting their kernel access removed, would make the an average run of the mill virus scanner, and if they are required to update their certificate every time, they would then be behind the ball in terms of protection as a threat would potentially have days/weeks to infiltrate before Crowdstrike gets to update.** 

In the short term, I also believe customers will break their contracts and move to competitors. Lawsuits will also happen for all the loss of business, as negligence isnt covered under insurance.

- Top line/ Growth- it’s possible to lose customers during contract renewals cycle.
- Top line/Growth- Forget about more govt clients, industry facing large customer bases like airlines, airports, utilities etc. 
- Bottom line - many sales team may jump or need huge options n hikes further eroding bottom lines

I wanted to provide a brief, high-level, nontechnical overview and mention the relevant stocks.

CrowdStrike (CRWD) was extremely negligent in rolling out a software product that could crash a significant portion of critical services world-wide.

There are tools and procedures and safety policies that can and should have prevented the underlying issue, but apparently they weren't used.

Microsoft (MSFT) also shares some of the blame because they could have been detected this faulty product after CrowdStrike released it to them.

Microsoft also could have had better ways to mitigate the damage once this update got rolled out and discovered to be faulty, notably by developing more seamless rollback features.

CRWD already took a beating today with a 11.10% drop.

This is unfolding to be possibly the biggest IT outage in history, so further impact is quite likely, on both CRWD and MSFT.

Some of this is may come in the form of legal liabilities and lawsuits, that can affect both stocks.

Others can be more worrying for MSFT if customers lose confidence in their products due to aspects of the outage that are more unique to MSFT platforms.

Finally, we may see some new or old companies evolve to try to prevent such costly outages in the future.",2024-07-20,50,57

I think fundamentally, at least in the near term, CrowdStrike is definitely going to suffer a lot of bottom line pain to compensate for damage or going through law suits.   

* However, do you think that their top line might be affected long term? 
* Is this event going to be dismissed as an one-off incident, or will organisations consider switching to SentinelOne? 
* Will high switching cost be a barrier that is too high for organisations to consider switching to alternative XDR providers?

1e84u9s_CRWD,CRWD,CRWD YOLO,"Saw a lot of bearish posts but no positions to back it up. I don't see the company recovering from this kind of blunder. Sure people make mistakes but this kind of blunder is not one that a cyber security company can recover from. Cyber security relies on reputation and trust. CRWD had that as a big advantage in the beginning; now that trust is gone. The irony of paying a cyber security company to protect you only to have them destroy your business far worse than an actual virus/hack attack would is insane. Hospitals were literally not operational; doctors and nurses couldn't check patient data on charts and had to cancel live saving surgeries, airports were all closed down costing airlines billions, hell you couldn't even call 911 for emergency services because that was down as well.  
  
Looking at the fundamentals and financials of this company it does not have anywhere near enough in it's cash reserve to cover all the incoming class action lawsuits that will be headed it's way. I see some people saying comments like insurance will cover it all. Insurance does not cover gross negligence. This was supposed to be a top of the line cyber security company that I was initially bullish about before this blunder. Where was the quality assurance? Why was their update not tested to make sure it worked properly first before sending it out to billions of devices world wide? This company is going to get absolutely buried.

1e7ij9y_MSFT,MSFT,"How today's CrowdStrike outage happened, and possible stock market ramifications.","The cause was a specific software bug that is not uncommon. There's a great [in-depth technical overview](https://x.com/Perpetualmaniac/status/1814376668095754753) posted on X.

I wanted to provide a brief, high-level, nontechnical overview and mention the relevant stocks.

CrowdStrike (CRWD) was extremely negligent in rolling out a software product that could crash a significant portion of critical services world-wide.

There are tools and procedures and safety policies that can and should have prevented the underlying issue, but apparently they weren't used.

Microsoft (MSFT) also shares some of the blame because they could have been detected this faulty product after CrowdStrike released it to them.

Microsoft also could have had better ways to mitigate the damage once this update got rolled out and discovered to be faulty, notably by developing more seamless rollback features.

CRWD already took a beating today with a 11.10% drop.

This is unfolding to be possibly the biggest IT outage in history, so further impact is quite likely, on both CRWD and MSFT.

Some of this is may come in the form of legal liabilities and lawsuits, that can affect both stocks.

Others can be more worrying for MSFT if customers lose confidence in their products due to aspects of the outage that are more unique to MSFT platforms.

Finally, we may see some new or old companies evolve to try to prevent such costly outages in the future.",2024-07-20,51,57
1e7tzds_CRWD,CRWD,People are wildly underestimating the implications of the CrowdStrike outage ,"I'm seeing a lot of people who believe this is gonna blow over. ""It's just an outage bro, happens all the time, we just fix it and move on"". No. Not when it's on this scale. Not when it takes billions off the global economy and cripples businesses. Not when it threatens the financial system. Not when it hurts the government themselves. It is just too big to ignore. 

Congress will investigate this and conclude that it's unacceptable. Not unacceptable 'I'm angry at you', but literally unacceptable - it cannot happen again. And the only way they can do that is to take it out of private hands or regulate the shit out of it. Either way, there is no future for it as an investment. 

And worse, it will prompt them to look at the implications of using AI to take over production in various areas. Something they know is an issue, but have managed to ignore so far. They won't ignore it anymore. There will be sweeping regulation in this area too.

1e78kzi_CRWD,CRWD,CRWD root cause analysis will be bad for AI,"Predicting that the Crowdstrike outage is the beginning of the end for AI boom. 

Why?

Crowdstrike actually did roll this out gradually, however their lab and test environments were all supported by AI which was tasked with ensuring all steps were green, as a result it wrote the appropriate test step to check and pass a malformed windows system file. 

Since all deploy steps were green Crowdstrike published their release. Clients set up for auto upgrade began upgrading and seeing the blue screen of death because the real world ended up being different than AI generated environment. 

But Why also Microsoft?
Because co-pilot is the engine behind this all. 

So what now?
Obviously load up on calls and buy this dip, as for me I’m targeting August 9, $350. 

Regardless what’s actually happened, Wallstreet isn’t going to want egg in their face, they’ll pump it back up until there’s some other type of news impacting cyber security or the Olympics being hacked before their darling actually decreases in price. 

As for the future of AI, I don’t think it’ll crash per say, but things will probably slowly stay flat as more money rotates into other sectors. Most likely AI will Peter-out as death by a thousand paper cuts and marketing budgets start to focus on hyping the next thing. 

TLDR: AI greatest ability is to provide false confidence. Crowdstrike recent outage was clearly deployed with false confidence. Industry will take heed and pull back AI investments. ",2024-07-19,6,30

KKR & Co. Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. and GoDaddy Inc. will join the S&P 500 as part of its latest quarterly weighting change. The companies will replace Robert Half Inc., Comerica Inc., and Illumina Inc, according to a press release from S&P Dow Jones Indices Friday. The changes are set to go into effect prior to the open of trading on Monday, June 24.

New York-based KKR’s inclusion underscores the massive growth of the private investment business in recent years. KKR, founded in 1976 by Henry Kravis, Jerome Kohlberg and George Roberts, recently laid out a plan to reach at least $1 trillion of assets under management in five years, in part by courting retirees and individuals. Famous for its private equity moves, the firm has expanded across strategies from buyouts and credit to infrastructure, real estate and insurance.


Meantime, CrowdStrike and GoDaddy’s additions come as stock investors are flocking toward software companies in a bid to capture the growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

1cj8rco_ZS,ZS,FTNT Results - buy ZS and CRWD,"ZS and CRWD are buys after FTNT's disappointing earnings

TL;DR: FTNT's shift towards SASE solutions at the expense of legacy firewalls bodes well for cloud security players like ZS and CRWD. I doubled down on ZS.

FTNT reported weak billings and highlighted their transformation towards becoming a major SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) player, moving away from traditional firewalls. While the market initially punished cybersecurity stocks, a deeper dive suggests this is actually good news for cloud-based security vendors.

The key takeaways:

* PANW: Neutral to Negative. Palo Alto still relies heavily on firewalls, so we can expect a poor quarter from them based on FTNT's results.
* ZS: Positive. The accelerating shift from firewalls directly benefits ZScaler's cloud security offerings. Despite potential share loss, ZS will grow rapidly in dollar terms. They've been aggressively building their sales force to capitalize on this trend. I'm doubling down - expecting ZS to hit $220 within a month and $350+ within a year.
* CRWD: Buy. While I believe ZS will outperform, CrowdStrike is still a solid buy given current tailwinds.

FTNT's pivot shows legacy firewall vendors losing ground to cloud security disruptors like ZS and CRWD. I took advantage of the dip to load up on ZS. Their future looks incredibly bright as secure cloud adoption continues accelerating.

The problem is, I have calls on PANW, and at the moment the market is not doing so hot. When ZS investors expressed some mixed feelings about stock valuation, PANW dropped in sympathy.

I need to know if CRWD might do the same and if I should dump my calls. My expiration date is set for 3/28 and if there’s a low chance of market recovery, I don’t want to be a bag holder.

Thoughts?",2024-03-04,14,28

**Hypothesis:** Palo Alto Networks (PANW) dropped nearly 30% last week after reporting earnings. PANW, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, Sentinel One have been beating on earnings and revenue for last several quarters. PANW Guidance was negative: less demand in government, overall market spending fatigue, and strategic shift for them causing short-term uncertainty (ChatGPT has the detail summary below from [earnings call script](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/02/20/palo-alto-networks-panw-q2-2024-earnings-call-tran/)).  It's recovered a bit thanks to Pelosi & other money buying the dip. This might be a sign other cybersecurity industry may be reducing guidance overall. PANW makes hardware in addition to software and are profitable while ZS, CRWD, S, pure software and cloud with no profits.

**The play:** ZS, CRWD reacted but also recovered last week. ZS reporting this week (2/29). I'm thinking possible repeat. ZS@242 currenlty. Maybe 20% drop so 200P or below could be good.  If ZS drops then CRWD, and S would drop. S did drop hard same time last year. Current prices of this week's PUTS below. Earnings still some days away so they can still depreciate. Might be good to lotto some in case ZS dumps hard, should offset IV (155%) some since C/P ratio at 66% (more open interest on calls this week too), not pricing in downward price pressure.

ChatGPT detail summary of why PANW tanked:  
 

It appears that the stock price of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) may have been affected by a combination of factors, including the announcement of their fiscal Q2 2024 earnings. Here's a summary of key points that could have influenced investor sentiment:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Palo Alto Networks reported robust growth, with revenues growing 19% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating margins expanding by nearly 600 basis points, and a 39% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This indicates a strong financial performance, which is typically positive for stock prices.
2. **Investment in Growth and Innovation**: The company highlighted substantial investments in their three platforms - network security, Prisma Cloud, and Cortex - and achievements like continued ARR growth in their SASE business and leadership in cloud workload security. While investment in growth is essential, it can sometimes concern investors about the short-term impact on profitability.
3. **Softness in US Federal Government Market**: The company noted a significant shortfall in their US Federal government business, attributing it to deals that did not close as expected. This situation, anticipated to continue into Q3 and Q4, could be a potential reason for concern among investors, impacting the stock negatively.
4. **Guidance and Strategic Shifts**: Palo Alto Networks provided guidance for Q3 and the fiscal year, indicating expected growth. However, they also discussed a strategic shift towards accelerating platformization and consolidation, aiming for a $15 billion ARR by 2030. While ambitious, strategic shifts can lead to uncertainty among investors, affecting stock price.
5. **Platformization and Consolidation Strategy**: The company is focusing on a platformization strategy, emphasizing reducing execution risk for customers by offering extended rollout periods and aiming for larger, long-term contracts. This approach, while potentially beneficial in the long term, might have led to concerns about short-term financial impacts, especially regarding billings and revenue growth.
6. **Demand and Spending Fatigue**: Despite strong demand, the company mentioned that customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity, seeking better ROI and total cost of ownership. This acknowledgment might raise concerns about future sales growth and the competitive environment.
7. **AI and Future Growth Opportunities**: The company is optimistic about leveraging AI for future growth, identifying it as a significant opportunity. While this could be seen as positive, it also adds a layer of execution risk and investment that might concern investors focused on short-term returns.

In summary, while Palo Alto Networks demonstrated strong financial performance and has a clear vision for future growth, concerns about the US Federal government market, the impact of strategic shifts on short-term financial metrics, and broader market conditions could have contributed to the stock price movement. Investors might be weighing the balance between short-term uncertainties and the potential for long-term growth and market leadership.",2024-02-27,14,28

1865z5q_CRWD,CRWD,CRWD Earnings Alert: Everything you need to know 🚀🔥,"Yo guys, cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike (CRWD) is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings today, after the market closes. Analysts expect the company’s revenue and EPS for the third quarter (ended July 2023) to increase 33.8% and 84.9% year-over-year to $777.38 million and $0.74, respectively. Moreover, CrowdStrike reported better-than-expected financial results in the last reported quarter. And get this: last time around, these cyber gurus smashed the estimates with a killer Q2, bagging $731.63M in revenue. That's beating the guesswork of $724.44M from the analysts. Straight up crushing last year's $506.20M in Q2 2023. Buckle up, boys, we might see some fireworks! 🚀💥💸

CRWD’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 37% year-over-year and reached $2.93 billion as of July 31, 2023, of which $196.20 million was net new ARR added during the quarter.

The cloud company further reported an adjusted EPS of $0.74. That's not just smashing the street's guess of $0.56, but also up a massive 105.6% from last year's quarter. Talk about leveling up! During the second quarter, these cyber kings raked in a record $245M in cash flow ops and a whopping $189M in free cash. That's what we call making it rain!

But hold up, it gets better. Importantly, CRWD has an impressive history of delivering strong quarterly performances. The company beat analysts’ earnings expectations for 15 consecutive quarters (fuckin' legendary win streak🚀), signaling they might blast past estimates yet again. Wall Street is very upbeat about the demand backdrop for CrowdStrike, especially with cyberattacks going nuts. Sounds like the cyber world is CRWD's playground, and they're just scoring one win after another. 📈👀

“CrowdStrike delivered strong growth at scale, exceeding our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics in the second quarter,” said George Kurtz, CRWD’s President, CEO, and Co-Founder.

“The AI-powered Falcon platform’s native capabilities across our cloud, identity, and next-gen SIEM businesses are unique in the market, in aggregate contributing well over half a billion dollars in ending ARR. Our platform strategy sets us apart from the competition, resulting in high win rates as customers rapidly embrace Falcon to consolidate vendors, lower TCO and achieve better security outcomes,” he added.

After earnings topped estimates, CRWD raised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expects revenue to be between $775.40 million and $778 million. Non-GAAP income from operations and net income attributable to CrowdStrike are expected to be $154.40-156.30 million and $179.80-$181.80 million, respectively.

Further, the cybersecurity company expects non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders to be $0.74.

For the full year 2024, CRWD anticipates its revenue and non-GAAP income from operations to be $3.03-$3.04 billion and $601.30-$610.50 million, respectively. Also, non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike is expected to be $680.50-$689.70 million and $2.80-$2.84 per share, respectively.

Shares of CRWD have gained 15.6% over the past month and 41.2% over the past six months to close the last trading session at $210.66. The stock has surged 104% year-to-date.

Okay, but that's all in the past. Here’s what could influence CRWD’s performance in the upcoming months:

CrowdStrike’s third-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal third quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Subscription revenue? Dude, stellar growth that's juicing up the top line big time. Plus, the crew at CRWD's been busy pulling in fresh subscribers like there's no tomorrow, giving their earnings a sweet boost.

And get this: CrowdStrike's bromance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is paying off big. Their products chilling on the AWS platform? Genius move. We're seeing more deals pop off in AWS Marketplace, co-selling shenanigans with the AWS sales gang, and mad love for AWS service integrations. All this is set to turbocharge CRWD's earnings in the quarter we're all eyeing. 💻

**Positive Recent Developments**

On November 22, CRWD announced that its AI-powered cybersecurity offering for small and medium businesses (SMBs), CrowdStrike Falcon Go, is officially available on Amazon Business. This marks the first CrowdStrike offering on Amazon’s business-to-business (B2B) store and the broadest dedicated distribution channel for CRWD’s growing SMB offerings to date.

Moreover, this game-changing CRWD offering, CrowdStrike Falcon Go, was launched on November 15. With a few simple clicks, SMBs can quickly and easily deploy industry-leading protection to stop the modern cyberattacks that ineffective antivirus products may miss.

**Robust Financials** 

CRWD’s revenue increased 36.7% year-over-year to $731.60 million for the fiscal 2024 second quarter ended July 31, 2023. Its non-GAAP income from operations grew 78.4% from the year-ago value to $155.70 million. Also, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was $180 million, compared to $85.90 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Furthermore, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike per share was $0.74, an increase of 105.6% year-over-year. Net cash generated from operations was $244.80 million, compared to $209.90 in the previous year’s period. Its free cash flow came in at $188.70 million, up 39% year-over-year.

**Favorable Analyst Estimates**

Analysts are placing their bets high on CRWD, expecting a monster 35.6% year-over-year growth in revenue, hitting $3.04B for the fiscal year ending Jan 2024. And that's not all – they're predicting EPS to rocket up 83.8% to $2.83. Talk about printing money! Plus, these cyber wizards have been beating the street's guesses on revenue and EPS for the last four quarters straight. They're not just playing the game; they're owning it!

But wait, there's more! For fiscal 2025, the forecast is looking juicy with revenue and EPS expected to balloon by 28.6% and 24.6% to a whopping $3.91B and $3.53, respectively. CRWD isn't just shooting for the moon; they're on a one-way trip to Mars with these growth numbers! 🌌

**Elevated Valuation**

Get a load of this: CRWD is trading with a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 74.45x, which is a whopping 224.5% higher than the industry's average of 22.94x. That's not just a lead, that's dominating the whole game! It's up to you to decide if you think this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

But hold up, it gets crazier. CRWD's forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA are sitting at a sky-high 15.78x and 65.85x. Compare that to the industry's measly 2.63x and 14.63x, and it's like CRWD's playing chess while everyone else is stuck on checkers.

And if that wasn't enough to make your head spin, peep this: CRWD's forward Price/Sales and Price/Cash Flow are at 16.55 and 47.27. That's 529.7% and 119.8% higher than the industry averages of 2.63 and 21.51. CRWD isn't just ahead, they're in a whole different league! 🚀

**Mixed Profitability**
🔍 Dive into these numbers, folks: CRWD’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin is a juicy 74.04%, crushing the industry average of 48.67% by a massive 52.1%. They're not just playing the game; they're rewriting the rules.

But wait, there's more: their levered FCF margin over the past 13 months? A whopping 33.44%, which is a mind-blowing 307.8% higher than the industry's 8.20%. CRWD is basically printing cash compared to the rest of the pack.

Now, not all sunshine and rainbows: CRWD's trailing-12-month EBIT margin is in the red at -5.78%, lagging behind the industry's 4.69%. Same story with their net income margin at -3.54%, which is lower than the industry's 1.77%. And when it comes to ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA? They're sitting at -6.10%, -4.08%, and -1.69%, not exactly shining compared to industry averages of 0.80%, 2.60%, and 0.07%.

So yeah, CRWD is killing it in some areas, but they've still got some homework to do in others. 📚

**What to do for Earnings?**

CRWD has moved an average of 8% with earnings. It seems reasonable to grab a CRWD 12/1 220c @ 3.90. You'd need the stock to hit ~224 by Friday to break even, which is about a 5.5% gain. Easy, right? Well, that's what I'm grabbin. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. We have SNOW, OKTA, and DELL this week. Stay tuned!",2023-11-28,21,17
184lkd7_ZS,ZS,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

184lkd7_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

165f733_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves and more: Salesforce, Okta, Chewy and Crowdstrike","The indices are flat to start this Wednesday. Some important economic data just dropped but it doesn't seem to be moving markets too much. GDP was revised lower and ADP jobs was lower than expected. The US 1 and 2-year yields are down slightly.

Today we have a slew of earnings after the bell, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike headlining, but also Okta, Chewy, Five Below and more. See below for current expected moves. We looked at CRM yesterday so let's cover CRWD today. Here's the current expected move chart: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1kkyq5339lb1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd94ea845432412c82053680e96b56f1786cf3b3

The expected move of 7% compares to recent actual moves of -2%,  
 \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.

The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

An Iron Condor, selling the 7% move would need the stock to stay between $134 and $160 essentially. With max gain between $136 and $157.50. It risks about $3 to make $2.

 \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.

The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

An Iron Condor, selling the 7% move would need the stock to stay between $134 and $160 essentially. With max gain between $136 and $157.50. It risks about $3 to make $2.

13x3577_CRWD,CRWD,Understanding the Potential of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD): A Due Diligence Analysis,"I'd like to share some due diligence on CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), a leading player in the cybersecurity market.

1) Strong Financial Performance: CrowdStrike recently reported impressive results for their April quarter. Their earnings per share rose by 84% to 57 cents on an adjusted basis, beating analysts' estimates. Additionally, revenue climbed 42% to $692.6 million. In both profit and revenue terms, CrowdStrike outperformed expectations, showing the company is making more money and delivering solid growth.

2) Disappointing Outlook, but Perspective Needed: Despite these robust results, the company's stock took a hit, mainly due to a less-than-stellar revenue outlook for the next quarter, projected at $722 million versus analyst estimates of $719 million. While the modest outlook may have disappointed some, it's important to remember that these are estimates - they can be surpassed. Besides, a consistent track of exceeding past estimates should be considered.

3) Solid Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): Subscription-based businesses thrive on their ability to secure consistent, recurring revenue, and CrowdStrike is excelling here. Their ARR saw a 42% increase to $2.73 billion, slightly above expectations. This growth indicates a healthy subscription base, providing a predictable and steady stream of future revenue.

4) Stock Performance and Rating: Despite a recent dip after the earnings report, CRWD's stock has climbed 46% in 2023 so far, indicating a generally upward trend. Also, it holds an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 84, meaning it has outperformed 84% of all stocks over the past year. Although it's not at the top of the scale, there's potential for further growth.

TLDR: While the short-term outlook might have triggered a negative reaction in the stock market, CrowdStrike's strong financial performance, rising ARR, commitment to innovation, and relatively strong stock performance all suggest a solid potential for long-term growth.",2023-06-01,9,39
13wrcad_CRWD,CRWD,"Earning plays for CRWD, CRM, AI, OKTA, and JWN","*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. 

Starting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.

CrowdStrike’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter’s top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.

Moreover, CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter bottom line.

Next is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company’s guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% gain.

Similarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company’s outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.

Salesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.

The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.

Salesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.

Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.

However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.

On May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  

Rangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce’s quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.

Despite that, Rangan noted, “As a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.” Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction.

I know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?

C3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company’s fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.

C3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.

With its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Aside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company’s $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company’s business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.

Those initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, ""Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.” The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.

For the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.

The company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there’s a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.

As noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.

The Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company’s consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock’s near-term direction.

Strong demand for the company’s Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.

The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.

Okta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products’ ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.

Demand for the company’s solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.

However, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.

Finally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.

Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.

In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.

Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Just to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I'm getting puts on JWN.

current assets to liabilities looks good and equity grew. This however is not a good thing when shares outstanding increase because you're either directly diluting investors and increasing cash position or you're financing debt with convertible equity, or you're paying staff with equity and saving cash on payroll expenses. 

Cash Flow:

[https://i.postimg.cc/k5K0gRCc/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/k5K0gRCc/image.png)

Basically, they are cash flow positive and this is because of noncash expenses that are treated as expenses following GAAP procedures. There are many companies that have negative GAAP EPS however when you adjust for noncash expenses, they have positive adjusted EPS. My personal take on these companies is not favorable because oftentimes they dilute their investors through heavy stock-based compensation programs. A company with Positive GAAP EPS is much easier to value and one that is repurchasing its shares to where shares outstanding is not growing is even better.

**Last Week – Typical Holiday Trading**

SPY rose 1.6% last week, in line with the 1.5% move options were pricing. Retail stocks helped continue the recent rally and the FOMC meeting minutes confirmed some market assumptions on the Fed’s next moves. Day-to-day volatility was also subdued and volumes light. Implied volatility again fell. The VIX finished the week at 20.50, its lowest close since mid-August. VIX futures are now steeply in contango with Jan VIX futures above 25 and March above 26. SPY 30-day IV is just 19, 60-day is 20 and 90-day is just 21. So SPY options are near historical averages across the board while VIX futures continue to price high 20’s out a few months.

**This Week – Economic Calendar Picks Back Up, Culminates on Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are again pricing just a 1.5% move for the upcoming week, but option premium contracted a lot to account for no trading on Thursday and a half day on Friday to end last week. There’s nothing market makers hate more than getting plugged with premium into a quasi 4-day weekend and that explains a lot of the IV drop last week. IV typically reflexes the other way on a Monday open following a long weekend.

Last week we highlighted a possible phenomenon that falling IV after sustained high IV (like we just saw) can have a bit of a snowball effect on both option pricing and actual market movement as the selling loads the market with gamma:

>File this under a “way too early to know” category, but one thing traders should be aware of is that falling implied volatility can be a self-fulfilling prophecy on realized (actual) market volatility **The TLDR version is that it can load the market with gamma that may act as a governor on market moves as there are deltas to be bought lower and deltas to be sold higher.**

That’s something worth keeping an eye on but with the NFP Jobs number this week and the FOMC December meeting on the 14th, there are a few potential market-moving events that could keep options bid. In fact, the expected move chart shows higher volatility for this Friday and the FOMC week (note the FOMC week in particular as IV jumps from 15 to 20 and expected moves expand, it looks like a stock does into earnings):

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bk140ef9yk2a1.gif

What that means is that even if market moves stay muted for now, options will have to keep the some key upcoming dates on the radar and price an assumption of volatility those days. That effect on IV may be less noticeable in individual stocks but traders should apply the same assumptions, particularly in stocks with close ties to interest rates and currencies.

The economic calendar this week has the aforementioned Jobs Number, but some other important events like the GDP number and a Powell speech/ Beige Book.

https://preview.redd.it/l6cxg36x0qz91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a5fa9ef395ee94087c8b1d7b63115158b8d

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",2022-11-13,241,55

### In the News

Oil, gas and energy companies are some of the best-performing stocks over the past few months, with some at our near all-time highs. Many top the high RSI (overbought) lists after seeing multi-year lows during the pandemic. For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100.

Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either. There are a lot of moving parts for these stocks right now, the war in Ukraine, a potential recession to name a few., but as volatility has visited both the broader stock market and the oil and gas markets, these stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have ”crashed higher” towards all-time highs without seeing corresponding increases in their own option implied volatility. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge, as put spreads for any reverse in oil prices are cheap (relative to oil itself) on the single name company side of things.

qpri9s_ZS,ZS,A couple of pairs worth watching [AMAT/SNPS; PANW/CRWD/ZS],"One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). 

Take Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  


By contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.

So let's take those out of the picture, shall we?

Applied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.

Synopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). 

&#x200B;

The same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. 

The point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. 

Additionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.

P.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out.",2021-11-09,11,8

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by 1.5%, more than the 1% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing less than a 1% (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $450 that corresponds to about **$446** as a *bearish expected move* and **$454** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX saw an intra-week high of about 19 mid-week, but came in Friday to finish the week about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22.50, down from about 23 last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

The major ETFs are all pricing smaller moves this week than they were last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **0.9%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with $1 wide wings based on the Expected Move for Friday, needs the ETF to finish between about $446.60 and $454.40 to make money. It needs the ETF between $447 and $454 to see Max Gain:

mrv9ij_PLTR,PLTR,CYREN ($CYRN) - The next Zscaler/Crowdstrike or the next Israeli cybersecurity acquisition?,"This is my first due diligence write up.  I started it a few weeks ago so some of the numbers may be off slightly.  I have been watching the stock for a while but since it hit a 52 week low this week I thought it was time to finish my post.

Some of the formatting below may be messed up so so can read the full document with images on this link - [https://docs.zoho.eu/file/575j4d337b0bbc6f340ed898da13e24ca0f4f](https://docs.zoho.eu/file/575j4d337b0bbc6f340ed898da13e24ca0f4f)

Feedback welcome.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

*The US-based firm has made a number of acquisitions in Israel, including* [*Cyvera*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cyvera) *for $200 million in 2014;* [*LightCyber*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/light-cyber) *for $130 million in 2017;* [*CyberCubes*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cybercubes) *and* [*Secdo*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/secdo) *in 2018; and* [*Twistlock*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/twistlock) *for $410 million,* [*PureSec*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/puresec)*, and* [*Demisto*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-to-buy-israeli-cybersecurity-firm-demisto-for-560-million) *for $560 million in 2019, according to data compiled by Start-Up Nation Central.*

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

*US-based cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said Tuesday it has acquired Israeli startup Bridgecrew for $156 million in cash, confirming an earlier report in the Calcalist financial website.*

*The US-based firm has made a number of acquisitions in Israel, including* [*Cyvera*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cyvera) *for $200 million in 2014;* [*LightCyber*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/light-cyber) *for $130 million in 2017;* [*CyberCubes*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cybercubes) *and* [*Secdo*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/secdo) *in 2018; and* [*Twistlock*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/twistlock) *for $410 million,* [*PureSec*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/puresec)*, and* [*Demisto*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-to-buy-israeli-cybersecurity-firm-demisto-for-560-million) *for $560 million in 2019, according to data compiled by Start-Up Nation Central.*

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

*US-based cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said Tuesday it has acquired Israeli startup Bridgecrew for $156 million in cash, confirming an earlier report in the Calcalist financial website.*

*The US-based firm has made a number of acquisitions in Israel, including* [*Cyvera*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cyvera) *for $200 million in 2014;* [*LightCyber*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/light-cyber) *for $130 million in 2017;* [*CyberCubes*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/cybercubes) *and* [*Secdo*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/secdo) *in 2018; and* [*Twistlock*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/twistlock) *for $410 million,* [*PureSec*](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/puresec)*, and* [*Demisto*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-to-buy-israeli-cybersecurity-firm-demisto-for-560-million) *for $560 million in 2019, according to data compiled by Start-Up Nation Central.*

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

Feedback welcome.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

* Forcepoint, Web.com, Sophos, Watchgard – all were previously public and now are private equity

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

mrv9ij_PANW,PANW,CYREN ($CYRN) - The next Zscaler/Crowdstrike or the next Israeli cybersecurity acquisition?,"This is my first due diligence write up.  I started it a few weeks ago so some of the numbers may be off slightly.  I have been watching the stock for a while but since it hit a 52 week low this week I thought it was time to finish my post.

Feedback welcome.

**1. Overview**

* **Israeli Cybersecurity cloud player** – $CYRN is way cheaper to participate in cybersecurity market and follow growth of 2020 rockets Zscaler ($ZS) and Corwdstrike  ($CRWD) [which are way overvalued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/these-3-tech-stocks-are-absurdly-overvalued-right-now/ar-BB19Nayp)
* **Strong institutional investors** – ""smart money"" invested at $0.75 ([2020 convertible](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-private-placement-convertible-104000290.html)), $1.15 ([2021 offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-13-8-million-132000789.html)), $2.50 ([2017 tender offer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warburg-pincus-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-ordinary-shares-of-cyren-ltd-nasdaq-cyrn-300575212.html))
* New product revenue up 140% in Q4 2020 (growth masked by decline in retired products)
* **Big tech customers** (Microsoft $MSFT, Google $GOOG, Zscaler $ZS, Fireeye $FEYE) and partners (Palo Alto Networks $PANW) with over 1.3 Billion combined users
* **Catalysts** – New products (Cyren Inbox Security), Microsoft Azure partnership, Palo Alto Cortex partnership, Solarwinds hack – both Microsoft & FireEye are Cyren customers, Blockchain security
* **Acquisition target?** Microsoft & Palo Alto are serial acquirers of Israel technology companies; Cyren competitors Mimecast ($MIME) & Proofpoint ($PFPT) also acquired Israel companies. Is $CYRN next?
* **Bottom line** \- Penny stock that has spiked to nearly $2.00 twice in the last year; average trading volume is up over 10X since December and price is hovering below $1.  Analyst PT is $1.50; could easily double or triple on big momentum move.

**2. Catalysts**

**a. Cybersecurity Market / Phishing**

2020 was big year for Cybersecurity.  Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Zscaler ($ZS) were each up 300%+ in 2020 and OKTA over 100%.  Palantir ($PLTR) IPO'd in September and has $49B+ market cap on $1B in revenue.  Many of the cybersecurity names are trading at huge valuations and it's hard for the average investor to participate.  Cyren is one of the few cheap stocks with big upside not already priced in – probably because revenues are flat.  (later let's dig deeper at why revenue is not gorwing faster)

Last month there was more [news on the newest Microsoft breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world). Also in 2020 there was the [big Solarwinds hack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/) that exposed the need for better security.  All the big security companies missed it, and Fireeye and Microsoft were two of the early ones who caught it in December.  Both Fireeye and Microsoft are Cyren customers – maybe their threat intel helped expose the hack?  Clearly the big guys need to do more and the hackers are winning.

The work-from-home (WFH) environment creates bigger risk for companies and phishing.  Companies are shifting budgets from offices and travel into IT security solutions to stop hacking attempts, ransomware, security breaches, etc.  Email is still biggest way hackers are penetrating enterprise.  Office 365 doesn't stop everything which is why they partner with companies like Cyren to block phishing.

**b. New Products**

Cyren launched new products in 2020 that they think will drive revenue growth in 2021:

* [Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyrens-anti-phishing-product-quickly-121500062.html)
* [Cyren Launches Threat InDepth to Help Enterprises Intelligently Tackle New Email-Borne Security Threats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-launches-threat-indepth-help-124500094.html)

On the quarterly calls, they talked about the revenue decline from old products – it will take some time to replace revenue from new products.

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4389488-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""While Q3 revenues were down slightly year-over-year, it is important to point out that our results **do not yet reflect material contribution from our growth initiatives**, although significant progress on that front was made in the quarter.

The **revenue decrease is primarily related to the end-of-life of some of our legacy offerings** on the Cyren Cloud Security platform, including Cyren Web Security, and the installed base is winding down through 2020 and into mid-2021. The lower revenue recognition during the period is partially attributed to the decline of revenues associated with those products.""

* [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

""As we discussed on prior calls, 2020 was a transition year for Cyren as we retired a number of legacy SMB products in order to focus on new enterprise products introduced this year, and as such, **revenues were expected to decline until the impact from new products offset the loss of revenue from discontinued products**.

As Brett mentioned previously, we saw good traction in the fourth quarter as revenue recognition from **CIS increased 140% quarter-over-quarter**. Revenue for the fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring reduction of $0.7 million for a multi-year customer contract that was restructured.""

In February they also issued a [PR on a Inbox Security customer win with 25,000 employees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sika-group-chooses-cyren-inbox-131500721.html).  If you assume that this service is $20 per year that is $500K in revenue from one customer.  With a few more of customers like these revenue starts to grow again.

They also [talked in the past about their blockchain security](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/increase-in-cryptocurrency-mining-threatens-more-than-just-your-cpu).  It is not clear if this is an active product offering or just something they do behind the scenes.  But if they can [capitalize on their cyber technology for Bitcoin and blockchain](https://www.cyren.com/blog/articles/cryptocurrency-phishing-attack-nets-over-1-million-in-a-few-hours) this could be a huge growth driver for Cyren.

c. **Customers**

Many of the customers listed on the website are HUGE players in the tech space.  Some of these are security companies, and all are large enough to do an acquisition of cybersecurity technology for $100M-$200M.

* **Microsoft – market cap $1.7T+**

There are lots of articles and PRs on the Microsoft partnership –

* [Cyren Integrates Additional Web Security Into Microsoft's Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyren-integrates-additional-web-security-into-microsofts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection-atp-300786293.html)

* Rackspace – market cap $4B
* Forcepoint, Web.com, Sophos, Watchgard – all were previously public and now are private equity

NOTE - the companies in **bold** have acquired companies in security and/or in Israel.

d. **Partnerships**

Some of these customers they talk about as partners – like Microsoft.  It isn’t clear if Microsoft is reselling Cyren products or just using their technology.  But the most recent press release in January makes it sound like they helping to sell the new CIS product.

* **Microsoft** \- [Cyren Inbox Security and Incident Response Service Expands Availability Through Azure Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-inbox-security-incident-response-131500765.html)
* **Palo Alto Networks** \-[ Cyren Joins Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-joins-palo-alto-networks-131500275.html)

[They also said on the Q4 quarterly](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408072-cyren-ltd-cyrn-ceo-brett-jackson-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) call that Palo Alto has big penetration into global 2000 and Fortune 100 enterprises – maybe this opens the door for more enterprise customers –

**""Additionally, we are pleased to announce a partnership with Palo Alto Networks**, one of the industry leaders in cloud security. We've recently integrated our enterprise threat intelligence solution threat in depth with Palo Alto's Cortex XSOAR platform, which is a leading security orchestration, automation and response platform. Cortex SOAR is used by security teams in **34% of the global 2,000 and 65% of the Fortune 100 enterprises** to simplify and harmonize security operations across an enterprise.""

I found the $PANW partnership even more interesting because (a) their founder is Israeli, and (b) they have acquired so many companies in Israel (see below).

e. **Recent Funding**

Cyren's most recent funding was [closed in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyren-announces-closing-13-8-154500221.html) \- $13.8 million at $1.15 per share.  A week before the offering, the stock was trading at $1.40+, including one after hours session it spiked to over $2.00.

* 30-day average volume Feb 16 – Mar 15:  avg 3.62M shares/day

h. **Acquisition Target?**

It's not likely that Cyren will remain standalone forever.  They have good technology and the cybersecurity sector is constantly consolidating.  Israel is known as a hotbed for cyber acquisitions, and Palo Alto, Microsoft, Proofpoint and Mimecast have all done multiple acquisitions in Israel.  It is only logical that Cyren will be attractive to one of these players for their Inbox Security, threat intel or customer base.

Look at these examples:

* **Palo Alto Networks** \- Nir Zuk Israeli founder (formerly Check Point).  Acquired 8 different Israel companies since 2014.

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palo-alto-networks-buys-cybersecurity-firm-bridgecrew-for-200-million-report)

**3. Risks and Risk Assessment**

Investing in Cyren is not without risks.  They are losing money and revenue growth is slow or non-existant.  But let's see if these risks are outweighed by the potential upside.

a. **Revenue Growth**

[Revenue for 2020 declined](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html) from $38M+ to $36M.  The company said this was planned because of older retired products.  However, it is still troubling that in the cybersecurity space where everybody else is growing at 30% year over year, Cyren is losing revenue.

The one bright spot is that they claimed revenue from new products was up 140% quarter over quarter so if this continues revenues should grow in 2021.

b. **Cash / Debt**

Cyren raised $13.8 million of new capital in February.  They also had $9M cash on the [balance sheet in December 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cyren-announces-fourth-quarter-full-210000095.html).  So the new cash should mean that they don’t have to raise cash again for a while.

They also have convertible debt on the balance sheet of $10M-$20M.  Some of this is related to the 2020 debenture raise at $0.75 so it should be converted to equity.  It is not clear what price the other debt will get converted or maybe it was already converted with the recent raise in February.

c. **Compliance**

This week Cyren announced it received a delisting notice from Nasdaq; the same thing happened a year ago and it was cleared.  With the stock trading below $1, there is a risk they will do a reverse split to get the price back above $1 but if the stock goes back over $1 for 10 days, the issue goes away.

d. **Dilution**

Before the February offering, [Cyren had 62M shares outstanding](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000121390021009329/ea135592-424b5_cyren.htm).  They sold another 12M shares in the offering so they presumably have around 74.7M shares outstanding after the offering.  The offering also included warrants and the convertible debt would also cause dilution if it is converted into equity.  So you can assume that the outstanding share count will continue to increase until the company becomes profitable.

e. **Liquidity / Volume**

As stated above, average daily volume has gone from 90K shares to 3.6M shares per day in March.  The [current average volume listed on Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYRN?p=CYRN) is 2.4M shares per day.  This should mean that unless you are buying $millions it is easy to get in and out of the stock.  I think this increase in a volume is a good indication that a lot more people are watching the stock and waiting for a bigger catalyst to move the stock.

f. **Insiders**

Cyren [board and management has a lot of shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/cyrn) and their incentives are to get the share price up.  There has been a lot more buying than selling with all of the directors buying 20K shares and the CEO and CFO each have 650K-1.6M shares.  Warburg Pincus is also listed as an insider and seems to be holding and acquiring shares since 2017.  Even with the share price going down they have added more shares.

g. **Marketing**

Cyren Marketing is not very good.  Unlike most cyber companies, they only do occasional press releases which sometimes move the stock.  I am used to seeing PRs every week but Cyren sometimes goes months without any significant news.  Fortunately they seem to have relatively [good blog](https://www.cyren.com/blog) and twitter feed with lots of webinar announcments.

**4. Conclusion**

Overall, I think Cyren as a penny stock has much more upside than downside.  At less than $1 per share and trading at a discount to the sector, they could easily double or triple just by increasing revenue growth.  The analyst price target is $1.50 but that seems conservative.

I don't think there is much downside here.  The current investors put money in at $0.75 and $1.15 and Warbrug is averaged over $2.00.  I don't see the stock trading below $0.75 for very long – otherwise the investors would probably force a sale of the company at a 30-40% premium to where the shares are trading.

The wildcard here is whether the company can get acquired.  Cyren will not likely remain independent forever and there seems to be more and more cyber acquisitions announced every week (especially in Israel).  If they execute well it wouldn't surprise me to go to $2 and then get acquired for $4 or $5 per share.  This is easily a single or a double but could be a 4-5 bagger.

It has grown revenues by about 17%/quarter over the last 10 quarters. Quarters, yes...not years but Quarters (Insane)!

I think the company can get to $1T by end of the decade (maybe sooner), which would be 20x from where it is now.

Competition is high but the space is big enough for more than one fish.

Am I missing something obvious?

Cloudflare seems to me to have bigger potential, better tech and a more dedicated workforce, but have a hard time monetizing it, whereas Crowdstrike has cash reserves, steady income and incredible growth (Something like 89% YOY).

CrowdStrike ($CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that sells its software to large corporations, government clients, major banks, healthcare and energy companies. Some of its customers include Goldman Sachs, Amazon Web Servers, MIT, and a shitload of other institutions and corporations. They also have an international presence selling their software in Germany, Australia, UK, India, and Romania. In short, their software protects files saved in the cloud, so all of Jeff Bezos dick pics are safe thanks to them.

With the expansion of companies adapting to a WFH format, the need for security of all this information going through the cloud is in high demand. The demand for CRWD's software must be skyrocketing just like every other tech company. There is no supply chain issue with this product either so need to fret like other tech companies having supply chain issues as they rely on 10 year olds working in sweat shops in Chi-na. 

Earnings come out in 13 day (June 2 for you special ones) and its expected that they will have benefitted greatly from corona. Their price finished the day at $80.97 and have steadily increased from their March lows of $31.95 without missing a beat like most tech companies seemingly to be unaffected by how the SPY has done since the initial gaping dip. It has an ATH of $101.88 so these aren't uncharted waters for this stock. IV isn't gushingly high, around 75%, especially compared to other tech companies approaching earnings so the time to act is ASAP bc I believe it will be well over %100 by next week. 

Tried to keep this short and sweet bc I know most of you only have a 3rd grade reading level and probably just scrolled to the bottom to see just how retarded I am.

**$CRWD 85c 6/5**

If its deep (I like it deep) ITM a day before earnings plan on selling EOD, if not then I'll fucking gamble like the degenerate I am on their earnings pumping their price like I do with my penis before bed every night. Hope at least one of you jabronies got off to this so I can feel accomplished for once, good luck and may the pump be with you.

Edit: CRWD’s 50 DMA just surpassed its 200 DMA so it’s in golden cross territory now boys. Keep an eye out for ZS and how it does in its upcoming earnings (6 days) as they’re similar companies. If ZS shoots up post earnings expect CRWD to follow

Edit (5/26): yelp today sucked camel dicks no other way to put it. After opening all tech it seemed like started to go down and unfortunately CRWD got grouped in it. Still optimistic as earnings is still 7 days away and we got plenty of time for a nice run up. Watch to see how ZS does could be a nice little predictor of what’s to come for CRWD. I’m staying strong boys, god speed and diamond hands

Edit (5/27): well fuck me sideways holy shit. All of tech is getting Cleveland steamered. Still holding hoping ZS pops post earnings tomorrow and helps CRWD but 20 days of gains gone in 2 days is fucking gross and the second most unfortunate thing to happen to me next to being born. Sorry boys tech is in a whirlwind of shit and we’re all just living in it.

Edit (5/29): ZS with an insane pump this morning on Q3 ER. Imagine what CRWD’s numbers will look like on Q1 ER. Hope everyone who played this stuck it out bc we looking sexy boys",2020-05-20,55,119
