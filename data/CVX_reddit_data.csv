1jlcogn_CVX,CVX,ConocoPhillips or Chevron?,"I am trying to increase my exposure to large oil & gas producers with good dividends. I think $COP or $CVX are my best options. However, I have some concerns for both which makes it difficult to decide:

$COP

+ Great asset portfolio
+ Producer of only oil & gas (independent oil & gas company)
- I have not been able to find an overview of their development projects
- Dividend at 3.1% and seems to prioritise buybacks

$CVX
+ Good asset portfolio
+ Great development projects
+ Great dividend at 4% and increasing
- Not only an upstream producer of oil & gas, for example it also has a downstream business. Not what I am looking for as I only know the upstream business

I am not sure why $COP 'only' yields 3.1% but from what I could see, a 4% dividend is not sustainable with the current buybacks and oil price.

Do you have any comments regarding the above? Or should I look at any other producer?",2025-03-27,8,6
1j7o4h3_AVGO,AVGO,"Chevron (CVX): Analysis of a 4.38% Dividend Yield, Is It Worth the Investment ?","Model and Strategy

Chevron is a leading integrated energy company active across upstream, midstream, and downstream operations. The company’s strategy focuses on balancing its traditional oil and gas portfolio with growing investments in renewable energy. For instance, in recent fiscal years, Chevron has reported annual revenues in the range of $150–$160 billion, demonstrating its scale and market reach.

⸻

Financial Results

Chevron’s financial performance remains robust:
	•	Revenue: Approximately $155 billion annually.
	•	Net Income: In the ballpark of $30–$40 billion.
	•	Market Capitalization: Estimated at over $300 billion.
	•	Dividend Yield: Around 4–5%, supported by a strong history of dividend increases.

These figures highlight Chevron’s operational strength and its ability to generate significant cash flow, even amid market volatility.

⸻

Dividends

A major draw for investors is Chevron’s commitment to returning capital to shareholders. With a dividend yield of about 4–5% and a long track record of consistent dividend growth, Chevron is particularly appealing to income-focused investors. This dividend strength reflects the company’s disciplined capital allocation and stable cash flow.

⸻

My Opinion

Chevron’s diversified operations, solid financial metrics, and attractive dividend policy make it a compelling long-term investment. Although the company faces risks from oil price fluctuations and regulatory challenges, its strategic investments—especially in renewables—position it well for future growth.

⸻

SWOT Analysis

Every now and then you come across a stock that is high reward but relatively low risk. These are penny stocks that have the potential to 5x but the downside of going lower from current price is highly unlikely. These are stocks that lacking visibility.

Look up  **CEMATRIX Corporation (CTXXF)/** **CEMATRIX Corporation (CVX.V)**  (. Its a cellular cement company.

It's currently at 23c/share and only a 32 mil market cap.

I dent like promoting stocks for others or giving financial advice but I want the numbers and data to speak for themselves. Just look up their recent earnings and their backlog of existing contracts and future outlook and tell me how this stock does not at least tipple in 2024.

How often do you have a penny stock be an industry's leader in it's sector (Cellular cement might not seem like a big market but it's a niche business that is expected to be 48.2 Billion by 2031 while the market cap of this company is only 30 mil curranty). The US infrastructure bill only helps this industry and their partnership with Lafarge (the largest cement manufacturer in the world only gives it more credibility).

their current backlog of contracts is $92.3 million as of November 15th, 2023. and their market cap is $30 mil lol. This stock is going up for sure when people get wind of things.

I'm going to come back in a year and repost this thread when it's tipple the price. Feel free to screenshot this yourself and hold me accountable but i'm pretty sure this time next year this stock is over $1 per share.

16mkobi_CVX,CVX,Chevron - a bleak outlook,"Chevron's earnings have been boosted by soaring energy prices in FY 2022, but as prices consolidate, the company's earnings prospects have deteriorated. CVX is now already deep into an earnings contraction and their Q2'23 free cash flow did not cover shareholder returns. With falling EPS estimates and valuation risks, investors should be cautious.  
Chevron profited in FY 2022 from rising prices for petrol and oil due to favourable market developments. Chevron was able to achieve record profits last year as a result of rising oil prices, but as those prices have begun to stabilise, the energy company's profitability prospects have gotten worse. Given the downward trend in the price of oil and natural gas and the sharp drops in earnings and free cash flow reported by Chevron in Q2'23, I think the company could experience significant losses in a world with lower prices.  
Chevron set forward a bold strategy to increase its free cash flow (estimated 10% FCF growth yearly, Source), but in my opinion, this objective will only be feasible if energy prices continue high. Long-term energy costs have never sustained 10-year highs and have instead consistently stabilised. Because of this, I think investors should prepare for more pressure on Chevron's earnings projections, which have already started to decline significantly. In the past 90 days, analysts have reduced their EPS forecasts for Chevron's fiscal year 2023 twenty times, compared to three upward EPS revisions.  
The largest threat to Chevron is the continuation of the production segment price realisations fall, which had a negative impact on the company's financial results in the second quarter. A severe recession could make this issue worse. Additionally, if Chevron does not comply with Australian unions' pay demands, the company's liquefied natural gas facilities could be shut down, which could put additional pressure on revenues in the near future.  
However, it's possible that a recession won't actually happen, which would be good for Chevron and oil prices. Reuters reports that the likelihood of a recession has just decreased. Energy prices may rise if a recession is avoided, which would reverse Chevron's profitability and free cash flow trend.

12uls9a_XOM,XOM,XOM vs CVX at this point in time? Any love for energy stocks?,"Hey folks, in an attempt to combat the hivemind, let's start a series of discussions! I saw a number of posts asking about different head to head stocks (Pepsi vs Coke, etc...) and thought it would make for some interesting higher effort posts. Here's some background stats for two companies CVX and XOM.

If you had to pick one, which one and why? I'll give my answer at the bottom.

|Metrics|Chevron|Exxon|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Div Yield|3.57%|3.12%|
|P/E Ratio|9.25|8.75|
|Payout Ratio (Fwd)|41.62%|37.55%|
|Market cap|323B|471B|
|Annual Increase Streak|37 yrs|40 yrs|

My personal pick was XOM. Back in early 2020 when there was some panic about oil companies due to oil futures dipping below zero temporarily, I was looking at both to see if I could benefit from the panic. CVX hadn't fallen from its height as much as XOM did. XOM had around an 8% yield at the time due to the price drop. There were concerns that XOM would lose it's dividend streak, but the CEO had come out and stated that XOM would keep its dividends. There was some concern from financial folks that they were being irresponsible with their cash flow, especially as the future looked uncertain especially in terms of travel. Thankfully, they kept their word and XOM has had an incredible recovery run since then.

* Berkshire’s operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.
* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.
* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter’s market turmoil, however.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate’s operating earnings — which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities — totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company’s utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA’s expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire’s equity investments amid the market’s rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is “usually meaningless.”

Shares of Buffett’s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&P 500′s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire’s equity investments amid the market’s rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is “usually meaningless.”

Shares of Buffett’s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&P 500′s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway $BRK.A has reported a 20% jump in operating profits in Q3. Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), and Chevron (CVX) remain Berkshire’s top holdings. Did you have a better Q3 than Warren Buffett?",2022-11-07,1,1
yfkzfh_CVX,CVX,"Chevron, Exxon up in premarket as energy sector earnings reports start to roll in, adding to industrial growth story","Results from Chevron's & Exxon's earnings reports reflect not just higher margins from higher energy prices, but significant increase in production as US energy producers begin to take market share from other oil producers (e.g. Russia). These reports add weight to the industrial growth story that has been shaping up so far this week. 

HOWEVER, will this result in higher stock prices in the near term? Maybe not. 

Firstly, the energy sector could always suffer the ""sell the news"" effect, just like any other industry can, and everyone was expecting great results from earnings reports. 

Secondly, the possibility of the still-overvalued tech sector/mega caps dragging down the broader indexes can always lead to investors dumping their index ETF positions, which of course drags everything down with it. 

On the other hand, everyone who wanted to avoid a correction might already be out of the market. In any case, any near term broad-market selloff should be a good buying opportunity for anyone who wanted to get into industrial stocks, but feels they missed the boat.

tqkpsc_CVX,CVX,What are your thoughts on CVX (Chevron)?,"Hi there, I'm one of the stubborn fools that think oil is going to stick around for a few more years, so I've had XOM and CVX on my watchlist for a while.

I've acquired XOM a few months ago (and happy I did), and had CVX in my sights as well, but never got around to getting them as I've pursued other opportunities (getting a bit of Abbvie, losing a bit on Sony...)

They've rallied about 30% in the last month, from 130 to \~170, largely due to the war situation/panic of oil scarcity etc. This is making me reluctant to buy, as it seems a bit high for my liking. Even looking at their basic metrics, P/E of 20, as opposed to the 15-16 of XOM (which is also quite high after the war rally), their dividend is also a bit lower than XOM's...

Considering these factors, is anyone going long on them? Or are you rather waiting on the sidelines till things settle down and the stock either corrects or the financials ""catch-up"" to it a bit?

· Current Report (8-K)

o On January 28th, 2022, Chevron released their Q4 earnings report

§ $5.1B in Q4 earnings ($15.6B annually), Free Cash Flow of $21.1B in 2021, $11.6B worth of share repurchases or dividends paid out in 2021, and a Full-Year EPS of $8.14.

*ESG Initiatives:*

In September of 2021, Chevron released their “Energy Transition Spotlight” presentation, which outlines their thoughts on the climate crisis, and how they plan to change their business going forward to be better for the environment. Firstly, Chevron highlighted their plan to reducing emission (“pathway to net zero”) which shows that they are planning to reduce their emissions by investing in renewable, hydrogen, and carbon capturing projects. Chevron has estimated that their plans should puut them on track to reduce their GHG’s by 35% by 2028.

Chevron also realizes that there is large growth opportunities in the renewable “low carbon” energy sector, and they have outlined multiple project that can help them to tap into that market. Furthermore, Chevron has highlighted that the renewable diesel and sustainable aviation, and renewable base oils & lubricant sectors can grow by 200% and 1900% by 2025 (44% and 171% annual growth rates) respectively.

These high growth prospects can help Chevron to grow their revenues and potentially avoid the 2.88% decrease rate expected in oil.

Bonner’s previous leadership roles include deputy managing director of Chevron’s Eurasia Business Unit, an asset manager in Chevron Thailand, and general manager of Corporate Strategy.

*As you can see, Chevron’s highest level management officers all have rich histories at the company and in their respective fields. Furthermore, they have all spent long periods of time advancing into higher roles within Chevron, which should imply that they all have extensive knowledge of the company from the ground up.*

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I came up with the following.

· [**$XOM – Exxon Mobil Corp:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/XOM)  Exxon explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas in the internationally. It operates through Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The company is also involved in the manufacture, trade, transport, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products; and manufactures and sells petrochemicals, including olefins, polyolefins, aromatics, and various other petrochemicals. As of December 31, 2020, it had approximately 22,239 net operated wells with proved reserves. 

· [**$SU -Suncor Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SU)**:** Suncor focuses on developing petroleum resource basins in Canada's Athabasca oil sands. Suncor explores, acquires, develops, produces, transports, refines, and markets crude oil internationally. Furthermore, Suncor markets petroleum and petrochemical products under the Petro-Canada (in Canada). The Oil Sands segment of Suncor business recovers bitumen from mining operations, and upgrades it into refinery feedstock and diesel fuel, for direct sale to market. The Exploration and Production segment is involved in offshore operations in Canada and internationally. The Refining and Marketing segment refines crude oil and intermediate feedstock into various petroleum and petrochemical products; and markets refined petroleum products to retail, commercial, and industrial customers through its other retail sellers. 

· [**$BP – BP PLC:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP) BP engages in the energy business worldwide. BP produces and trades natural gas; offers biofuels; operates onshore and offshore wind power; and provides de-carbonization solutions and services. BP is also involved in the convenience and mobility business, which manages the sale of fuels to wholesale and retail customers, as well as operation of electric vehicle charging facilities. In addition, BP produces and refines oil and gas; and invests in upstream, downstream, and alternative energy companies.

· [**$CVE -Cenovus Energy Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CVE) Cenovus develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas internationally. Cenovus operates through the Oil Sands, Conventional, and Refining and Marketing segments. The Oil Sands segment develops and produces bitumen in northeast Alberta. The Conventional segment holds assets in the operating areas of British Columbia and Alberta. The Refining and Marketing segment transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. 

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2021, Chevron was able to increase their revenues by 65%, their gross profits by 97%, reported an operating income of $15B (as opposed to a $6B operating loss in 2020), reported a net income of $15.5B (as opposed to a $5.5B loss in 2020), increased their free cash flows by over 12x, and increased their EBITDA by 192% YOY.

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2021, Chevron reported an overall great earnings report. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that this was a “one-off” event and broke a long downward trend in their financials. Chevron’s financial success is largely due to the strong oil prices in the last half of 2021. However, as long as oil remains this strong (even I only for another year or two) there is a good chance that CVX can yield great returns.

· **Q4 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, Chevron was able to grow their revenues by 91% (from Q4 2020 (YoY)), while limiting their COGS growth rate to 57% which helped them to obtain a higher gross margin. On the topic of gross profit, Chevron was able to amass $5B in gross profit (compared to -$0.66B in Q4 2020). Lastly, they were able to grow their FCF by 206%.

· **Q4 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** Chevron had very little to talk about in terms of bad figures in their earnings. However, in Q4 2021, Chevron experienced a decline of 7.6% in their oil production level.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing Chevron’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following: 

*PEG Ratio:* 

Based off of Chevron’s PEG Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $CVX stock should be valued at $217.25/share, which would imply a share price increase of 56.4%, which is quite high.

*P/S Ratio:*

Chevron’s P/S ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that the CVX stock should have a fair value of $91.34/share, which would imply their stock is overvalued, and needs to drop by 34% in order to be t fair value. This comparable reflects a very different story than the PEG multiple.

*EV/EBITDA Ratio:*

Chevron’s EV/EBITDA ratio indicates that their fair value is $117.30/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 15.5%. 

*Comparable Valuation:*

Due to the large variability between comparable analyses, I decided to take average the 3 comparable results. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $142, which implies an upside potential of 2.2%

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, I arrived at a fair valuation of $CVX stock of $129.61/share, which implies an downside risk of 7%.

*Dividend Discount Model:*

By imputing Chevrons previous 5 years of dividends, calculating the 5 year dividend growth rate, and comparing this to their WACC. I came up with a fair value of $171which implies that Chevron has an upside potential of 23%.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $CVX stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF model, and the dividend discount model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $CVX stock of $147.50/share, which implies an upside of 6%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $CVX stock would go as follows: 

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $140/share.

· Hold long-term (1-3 years), and re-invest dividends

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially their financial reports to see if they continue their growth, or if their growth starts to fall short of expectations).",2022-02-12,14,16

Chevron’s P/S ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that the CVX stock should have a fair value of $91.34/share, which would imply their stock is overvalued, and needs to drop by 34% in order to be t fair value. This comparable reflects a very different story than the PEG multiple.

*EV/EBITDA Ratio:*

Chevron’s EV/EBITDA ratio indicates that their fair value is $117.30/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 15.5%. 

*Comparable Valuation:*

Due to the large variability between comparable analyses, I decided to take average the 3 comparable results. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $142, which implies an upside potential of 2.2%

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, I arrived at a fair valuation of $CVX stock of $129.61/share, which implies an downside risk of 7%.

*Dividend Discount Model:*

By imputing Chevrons previous 5 years of dividends, calculating the 5 year dividend growth rate, and comparing this to their WACC. I came up with a fair value of $171which implies that Chevron has an upside potential of 23%.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $CVX stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF model, and the dividend discount model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $CVX stock of $147.50/share, which implies an upside of 6%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $CVX stock would go as follows: 

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $140/share.

· Hold long-term (1-3 years), and re-invest dividends

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially their financial reports to see if they continue their growth, or if their growth starts to fall short of expectations).",2022-02-12,14,16

* * * 

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. cut its Apple Inc. holding during the last few months of the year.

The conglomerate also revealed three new buys that it snapped up in secret. Berkshire bought stock in Verizon Communications Inc., insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. and Chevron Corp., bets that were granted confidential status and not revealed in a third-quarter regulatory filing, according to an updated document released Tuesday. The Apple stake reduction left Berkshire with a holding valued at US$120 billion at the end of 2020, according to another filing.

Berkshire spent the last three months of the year revamping its bets on some other sectors. Buffett’s conglomerate cut a few bank holdings, exiting JPMorgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and M&T Bank Corp. while slashing its Wells Fargo & Co. stake by 59 per cent. The company also shifted a recent bet on drugmakers by increasing a stake in Merck & Co Inc., Abbvie Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., while exiting a recent investment in Pfizer Inc.

Berkshire also exited a bet on Barrick Gold Corp. The investment was a surprise when it was revealed last year, given Buffett’s years of chiding the precious metal.

l9mrpb_XOM,XOM,"WSJ Exclusive: Exxon, Chevron CEOs Discussed Merger","This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:

* * *

The chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.

Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.

Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.

A combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.

But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.

One of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.

A handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron’s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips ’ roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.

Such a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.

It also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.

Many investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.

In an interview discussing Chevron’s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company’s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.

“As for larger scale things, it’s happened before,” Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. “Time will tell.”

Paul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.

Exxon was America’s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron’s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.

Exxon’s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron’s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.

Exxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.

Chevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet—in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.

Exxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Some investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon’s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.

Mr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon’s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.

Meanwhile, the company’s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon’s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.

Exxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.

Rivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven’t rewarded.

Exxon and Chevron haven’t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.

OPEC + will have to revisit the drawing board to address further deep cuts, as will non OPEC members such as the US. The million dollar question is - how low can it go? My sense is that $11 a barrel is egreigiously unsustainable and will greatly damage the industry in the US and abroad. That means that cuts are coming and the US will have to do something dramatic soon to prop prices up. I believe what we are seeing today is near the bottom, if not the absolute bottom.

To those of you that will address todays contango. This issue will be short lived, it literally cannot be sustained for more 24-48 hours.

fo39fb_CVX,CVX,$CVX - Chevron Dividend cut next? buybacks suspended.,"Our focus is on protecting the dividend <== lets HOPE SO!

The $5 billion annual share repurchase program has been suspended after repurchasing $1.75 billion of shares during the first quarter. The company completed the sale of its interest in the Malampaya field in the Philippines with proceeds over $500 million received in the first quarter. In April, the company expects to close the sale of its upstream interests in Azerbaijan and its interest in a related pipeline. The company continues to execute its plans to reduce run-rate operating costs by more than $1 billion by year-end 2020.

""Chevron's financial priorities remain unchanged,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber. ""Our focus is on protecting the dividend, prioritizing capital that drives long-term value, and supporting the balance sheet.""

XOM - Exxon Mobil - Sounds like this is one of the ""safer"" ones out there as far as oil goes. The dividend on this is less than that of the other 2 at 4%

CVX - Chevron - Similar to XOM, but the dividend is 5.3% at current prices. 

RDS.A - Shell - 9.3% Dividend! The chart looks worse than the other 2 though as it's trending down pretty hard. Seems riskier. Just this week Shell dropped from 45/share to 40. More than a 10% drop in 1 week.
