1iei4sd_DAL,DAL,What are UAL / LUV doing different than AAL / DAL?,"Since the COVID bottom to date, UAL and LUV fared much better than AAL and DAL. Just curious, what are UAL and LUV doing different than AAL and DAL?

5Y performance as of this post: 

* UAL: up 43%
* DAL: up 23%
* AAL: down 37%
* LUV: down 44%

1i051o6_DAL,DAL,Called DAL months ago and it was removed ,"I mentioned Delta Air Lines (DAL) among two other stocks in August of 2024 in this subreddit. I gathered these picks simply from looking at their charts and evaluating their business. 

For Delta, I saw that it was sitting very close to strong support on the chart, down significantly from its ATH, and was aware of its strong brand power and how it has been GROWING. I saw the delta X Starbucks rewards partnerships, the way their flights went, dealt with their customer service, etc. 

It made too much sense. I knew it was a free trade. 

I received two comments before the post was ultimately taken down for reasons I didn’t understand. One comment said (I’m paraphrasing) “airlines are a bad sector to invest in, and the other two are trash” 

The other was also negative. 

Now look at delta … over 60% since I posted the OG post. 

Guess what? I let those comments discourage me because maybe I didn’t know as much as I thought I did. 

Guess what else? Most people on Reddit are overly confident ego monsters. Most of you all are idiots.

Macro and Industry Trends Continue to Favor Airlines  - FED, EXPE earnings, ABNB earnings

* Cutting interest rates globally to boost economic activity continuing into the foreseeable future a tailwind for high-leverage industries such as the AI 
* EXPE air revenue up 4% YoY in Q3 compared to 0% in Q2 and 1.7% in Q1, highlighting positive trends 
* EXPE air bookings up 7.8% YoY in Q3, compared to 6.6% in Q2 and 1.4% in Q1 
* EXPE cited strong air bookings as a main driver for Q3 performance 
* EXPE raises FY24 outlook, citing growth and opportunities abroad despite previous travel demand concerns 
* EXPE total B2C revenue down 1.4% YoY in Q3 more than offset by 18.4% B2B revenue increase YoY

* ABNB performance less informative than EXPE on the AI 

 

Current DAL Performance, Positioning, and Upcoming Catalysts 

DAL and UAL are industry leaders well-positioned for the upcoming holiday travel season. I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:

* DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total 
* Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown) 
* Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue 
* Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends 
* Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends 
* Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers 
* AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop 
* CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20 
* Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends 
* Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively? 
* Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins 
* Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections  

Throughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3). As a tangent: potential upcoming trade opportunity will be comparing actual TSA check-in data during the winter months and trade off the spread between current AI optimism on Q4 travel and modeling what the actual data represents.

During this time, several readers pointed out valid concerns regarding the investment. I am updating my DD after two weeks to reflect developments regarding DAL as well as to address some of the outstanding concerns.  

In this post, I will touch on the following 

* Current news, analyst upgrades, and mid-quarter guidance from Delta 
* Address potential concerns about DAL 
* Further explore Delta’s competitive advantage and market position strength 
* Re-affirm my original price target of 56, representing another 20% upside by EOY 2024, despite the increasing valuation 

 

**Current News and Updated Guidance** 

* While the Fed rate cuts are at the forefront of investors' minds, fuel and oil prices are on the decline, both trends that benefit DAL 
* DAL outlines macro tailwinds in their recent mid-quarter guidance 
   * [Investor Update (q4cdn.com)](https://s2.q4cdn.com/181345880/files/doc_presentations/2024/09/Q3-2024-Investor-Update-vF.pdf)

   * No CRWD hangover on bookings 
* Analyst Rating Updates 
   * 7/12 Bernstein maintains outperform on DAL 
   * 7/13 BOA assigns BUY on DAL 
   * 7/17 TD Cowen maintains buy on DAL 
   * 7/17 Evercore gives buy rating on DAL 

**Addressing the main concerns outlined by critics of my previous DD:** 

Main concerns: 

* Airlines industry is too competitive, pressuring margins and limiting return to investors 
* Airlines are capital intensive, using high leverage to sustain their expensive aircraft fleets 
* There has been no fundamental change to Delta’s value proposition and market position 
* Technical Analysis on the long term is unreliable 

Response to concerns: 

Airline industry competition and margins – while the industry has been historically competitive, several key trends are strengthening the industry as a whole: 

* Oil and fuel prices declining, increasing margins 
* Rational supply control and elimination of excess routes by airlines inorganically raising demand 
* Rate cuts and consumer confidence leading to increasing demand from both corporate and leisure 

Capital intensive and high debt – while DAL took on high debt, it is actively making debt repayments and becoming investment grade top priorities 

* DAL’s debt is 94% fixed rate, reducing volatility associated with interest rates 
* DAL already has lower debt ratios than most of its peers 
* Fed rate cut opens the door for potentially favorable interest rate negotiations on debt 

No fundamental change in value proposition – DAL has consistently been an industry leader in terms of operations and reliability 

* Recent surveys and DAL demand demonstrates negligible brand impact from CRWD outage 
* Weakness in LUV and AAL (AAL dropping from S&P 500) further strengthens DAL as the major player in the industry 
* DAL’s leading ROE, ROA, and ROIC (13%) in the industry make it the most reliable choice for gaining exposure to air travel demand 

Technical analysis in the long term is unreliable – while I am not a professional on technical analysis, it certainly helps the thesis 

* Long-term positive technical trends help support the argument that DAL and airline industry is trending up 
* Short term MA outpacing long term 200MA indicates short-term momentum 

 

**Why DAL maintains stronger ROIC, ROA, ROE, and operating margins than its peers** 

* Main thesis – competitive advantage driven by its newer fleet compared to peers 
   * Newer fleet drives its strong brand strength, strong operational reliability, strong operating margins 
* Why newer fleet is a MOAT and hard to imitate 
   * New aircraft supply constraints 
   * High switching costs, debt costs for new aircraft 
* How new fleet drives brand 
   * Brand strength built on operational reliability, experience 
   * Newer planes are easier to maintain, less unexpected issues 
   * Better customer experience on newer planes compared to peers 
* How new fleet drives superior margins 
   * Newer planes are more fuel efficient, lower fuel consumption and costs 
   * Newer planes are less expensive to maintain 
   * Stronger brand, reliability, and experience allows DAL to charge a premium 

**Outlook and Current Positions** 

* I am maintaining my bullish outlook and my price target of 56 by EOY 2024, though now I am even more confident in my forecast 
* My current DAL positions (total market value of 24.8k)

1fa29yp_CRWD,CRWD,First DD: Bullish on Delta (DAL) through both technical and fundamental analysis in the medium term,"**Overview** 

The airline industry is known for being highly competitive, with fuel prices exposure, high customer power, and sector overcrowding driving downward pressure on margins as well as shareholder returns. Airlines are also extremely capital-intensive and require large amounts of debt to finance their Boeing and Airbus fleets. This leads to large interest payments that further narrow margins. The large amount of debt also increases equity volatility, causing airline stocks to be more volatile. Therefore, it is no surprise that the airline industry underperforms the broader market significantly; since its inception in August 2014, the US JETS ETF has returned a total of –21% to shareholders over 10 years, or about –2% per year.   

Delta is a leader in this industry. In the past 4 months, Delta has dropped from its high of 54 to a low of around 38, a 30% drop characteristic of this volatile sector. This drop can be attributed to three key factors: 1) rising jet fuel prices and declining margins, 2) lower expectations for consumer confidence and air travel growth, and 3) the CrowdStrike outage that wiped out 380 million in direct revenue for DAL. Delta currently hovers around 42 with a trailing PE of 6.1 and a forward PE of 5.9. In comparison, the broader airline industry trades at a median PE of 6.9 and forward PE of 5.6. 

It is empirically true that good companies in weak sectors can still generate strong returns; this is the case for Delta, a large company with strong FCF that many ignore or overlook due to the airline sector performance as a whole. My favorite long plays are on stocks with high volatility, attractive valuation, strong cash flows, and recent negative press that fails to fundamentally change its value proposition. Unfortunately, DAL fits all these criteria, and as a result I have come forth with a long thesis.  

**Technical Analysis** 

[20, 50, 200 MA for Delta on the daily chart from 2022-2024; signals 1, 2, 3 labeled](https://preview.redd.it/opj7jg4u33nd1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89e90d67a5cf9d1fc7f7934ccc65246100c162f)

Looking at the past 3 years (post-COVID) graph of Delta, it becomes clear that airlines are volatile but also momentous in the longer term. The graph has long stretches of both bullish and bearish runs; to be profitable a trader will seek to time entries into long and shorts within the transition period between bearish and bullish, maximizing exposure to the longer-term trend. My thesis is that we are currently in one of these transition periods. 

The red, blue, and gold lines represent the 20, 50, and 200 MA on the daily chart, respectively. We use a combination of three bullish signals to propose a long entry: 

* Signal 1: A downward trending 20MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart 
   * Out of the 11 occurrences in the past 3 years (red events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 10/11 (91%) times 
   * Red event 4 is the only event that fails this signal, while red event 8 lead the bullish run by 1-2 months 
   * In the past year, there has been 3 such occurrences, and DAL has continued a bullish trend 100% of the time 
   * The last occurrence was 2 weeks ago 
* Signal 2: A downward trending 50MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks 
   * Out of the 7 occurrences in the past 3 years (blue events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 7/7 (100%) times 
   * The 8th occurrence was yesterday 
* Signal 3: An upward trending 200MA crosses a faster, upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks 
   * Out of the 2 occurrences in the past 2 years (yellow events), DAL has continued a long bullish trend 2/2 (100%) times 
   * The 200MA has begun trending upward post COVID since April 2023 and continues its momentum 
   * The 3^(rd) occurrence will likely be within the next 2 weeks

These three signals consecutively have signaled strong bullish trends lasting 2-5 months representing 46% and 40% returns, respectively (34-50 and (34-50 and 38-53). We are now sitting at 42, with these three signals poised to align again. The current RSI14 is not high or low but rising, indicating growing momentum. However, we may be cautionary due to the lower-than-average trading volume during the past 2-3 weeks. 

Taken together, we project a conservative price target of 56, representing 34% return, within the next 4 months. 

Now, before we lose our entire portfolio, let's turn to the fundamentals, as just looking at technical signals is like driving a car by only looking through the rear-view mirror. 

 

**Fundamental Analysis** 

Despite the underperforming and highly competitive airlines industry, Delta is well positioned in the industry. Competition and strategic differentiation by price currently favor premium airlines (see: [Budget Airlines Want to Go Premium. That’s Easier Said Than Done.](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/budget-airlines-premium-perks-245a1d61)) As other airlines struggle to compete, Delta can capture a larger percentage of the total market in the short term. As a premium airline with brand strength, Delta’s pricing power will remain until its competitors can effectively compete on quality and experience. 

Furthermore, the airline industry has excess capacity as airlines were overly optimistic about demand forecasts post-COVID. As volume players correct overexpansion of routes while shifting away from volume towards quality, we can expect more rational price discipline and subsequent price premiums (and margins) to increase. While 90% of corporations do not expect corporate air travel demand to soften ([Delta Air Lines, Inc. - Delta Air Lines Announces June Quarter 2024 Financial Results)](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-June-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), slowing growth coupled with higher ROIC is preferable to value destruction; Delta’s key ratios ([DAL (Delta Air Lines) 1-Year ROIIC % (gurufocus.com),](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roiic-1y/DAL) [DAL | Overview (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/overview)) show ROIC strength compared to industry peers, as well as ROIC higher than cost of capital. 

Fuel cost impacts on margin may also trend favorably for airlines, as oil prices drop in the short term. With the markets potentially pricing in a Trump presidency, we may see fuel-cost tailwinds for Delta. 

Another short-term consideration has been the CrowdStrike outage; while investors have been pricing in the revenue hit, the scale and timeline of Delta’s recovery is still in speculation. Known for their operational prowess, this one-time, one-week fiasco is unlikely to have changed much except for the direct revenue hit. This event may have led to DAL being oversold in the short term (2 weeks ago).  

A 5-year growth-exit DCF valuation gives a fair value of 64, well above our price target of 56 from earlier: [Delta DCF Valuation | Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y) 

* Above model makes reasonable revenue growth assumptions 
   * Model projects DAL revenue CAGR of 4.77% 
      * Past 15 years, DAL revenue CAGR is 5.75%, or 6.24% removing COVID years 
      * Growth projection supported by DAL 200MA 
   * CAPEX assumptions are reasonable (11% consistent with historical) 
   * Terminal growth rate of 0.5%, Terminal Value 75% of EV – reasonable 
      * US population growth of 0.4% but trending downward 
      * US GDP growth 2-3% 
   * Airline industry unlikely to be replaced in the next decades 
* Note: if you check out the other valuation models at the above link, all but the earnings power value model forecasts a much higher fair value than the current price of 42 
   * This is due to the earnings power value model being reliant on historical earnings, which are heavily skewed due to COVID in 2020 and 2021 

Other notes: 

* Delta’s fleet is 40% airbus, making it less exposed to Boeing than other airlines 
* Recent US Dept. Of Transportation inquiry may impact share price(airlines including DAL must submit a report within 90 days: [Federal probe targets airline frequent flyer programs | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/travel/airline-loyalty-frequent-flyer-dot-probe/index.html) 
* Ongoing litigation with CRWD and MSFT, burden of proof 

Our fundamental analysis reaches the conclusion that DAL is undervalued, with the reason for lower multiplies possibly being attributable to the competitiveness of the industry, macroeconomic and consumer spend caution in the short term, jet fuel price uncertainty, and negative events in the short term. DAL should continue to enjoy strong cash flows as it reduces debt, strengthens its brand, and diversifies cash flows (56% of revenue from premium, loyalty, and other streams) in the unattractive airline industry.  

**Conclusion**

Combining technical and fundamental, we can confidently enter long on DAL with a time horizon of the next two quarters; I am looking to trade DAL at a good time, not a long time. Given this timeframe, here are my (updated) positions: 

* 30 Dec20-24 50 calls at 1.07 -> 3210
* 20 Jan17-25 50 calls at 1.4 -> 3800
* 40 Jan17-25 55 calls at 0.67 -> 2680

These positions represent a net cost value of 9.69k. May add on more.

I will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).

I may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.

My position: $48.5C

The other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.

  
Here is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \~8% to 12% post earnings:

1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%

2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share

3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.

4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).

5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:

Bonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):

***""So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.""***

***""Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***

***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***

***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***

***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.""***

This is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.

This is NOT financial advice.

Best Regards,

Baymax

14zl1wr_DAL,DAL,The $60/Share Bull Case for DAL,"Full disclosure, I'm long 100 Dec 50c on DAL. (currently down around 3k)

TLDR is at the bottom, so you still have to scroll regard.

Delta Airlines just had a MONUMENTAL, record-breaking quarter by any measure. Just to compare their most recent quarter to their July 2019 earnings when their share price was 61/share. As of writing, DAL is currently 46.5/share so I see a 30% upside on shares and a potential 3-4x on options.

I would argue that this is a straight apples to apples comparison, as the total shares outstanding in 2019 was around **650M** and as of this month their total shares outstanding is **640M.**

**Current Total Assets:** 6B more in 2023

**2019:**

* 7B

**2023**

* 13B

**Current Cash:** 600M more in 2023

**2019:**

* 2B

**2023**

* 2.6B

**Total Liabilities and Stockholder Equity:** 11B more in 2023 (worth nothing that a large portion of this is long-term debt and leases that they have begun paying down aggressively)

**2019:**

* 62B

**2023**

* 73B

**Operating** **Revenue**: 3B more in 2023

**2019:**

* 12.5B

**2023**

* 15.5B

**Operating Income:** 400M more in 2023

**2019:**

* 2.1B

**2023**

* 2.5B

**Diluted EPS**: $0.60 more in 2023

**2019:**

* $2.21

**2023**

* $2.84

**Some other important notes in closing:**

* Delta raised full year guidance by an entire dollar per share (roughly a 17% increase)
* Massive strength in new markets (record breaking international business both in Europe and transpacific with the reopening of Japan)
* Costs are forecasted to continue to decrease by 1-3% YoY
* Increased employee morale with 5% raises across the entire company (also shows strong cash position and outlook)
* Every analyst rating basically has a buy or overweight rating with a PT consensus of $60/Share

14oluwt_DAL,DAL,DAL - Everything you need to know about Delta Airlines new guidance and insight into the continued bull run,"✈️ ✈️ ✈️ 
This past Tuesday (6/27/23) DAL leadership highlighted a plethora of favorable guidance regarding operations, financials, EPS, and backed aggressive 2024 goals. 

Delta is now expecting 2023 per-share earnings to come in at the top of its range of $5 to $6 and for free cash flow to total $3 billion, up from $2 billion previously. 

The airline is expecting a return on invested capital of more than 13%, compared with earlier guidance of low double-digit growth. It expects its operating margin to come in at the high end of its 10% to 12% guidance range.

For 2024, Delta is still expecting EPS of more than $7, free cash flow of more than $4 billion, an operating margin of 13% to 15% and ROIC in the mid-teens.

The company also raised its revenue outlook for the June quarter to a rise of 17% to 18% from previous guidance of 15% to 17%. For all of 2023, it expects revenue to climb 17% to 20%, compared with earlier guidance of 15% to 20%.

There is also mention of AI 👀 🫢 and it’s future use in improving the customer experience.

The stock price has gained 38% in the past 3 months, but is still $20 below analyst expectations and pre-pandemic highs.

149plv2_DAL,DAL,$DAL - No Respect!,"The airlines continue to get no respect, led by Delta Air Lines ($DAL). Anyone just needs to look at the recent rally in the cruise line sector to see how the stock market is irrationally negative on the airlines. The investment thesis remains ultra Bullish on airline stocks like Delta.

For the last year, the market has told investors to not buy airline stocks due to an impending recession. Airlines like Delta have made tons of money and returned to cash flow positive, yet the stock hasn't rallied from the early 2021 levels when signs existed that travel demand would rebound from the covid destruction.

The amazing part here is that the cruise lines were about a year behind the airlines in removing covid restrictions and returning to profits and positive cash flows. Most airlines reported strong profits starting in Q2'22, though Delta reported small profits at the end of 2021.

Cruise lines like Carnival Corp. ($CCL) and Royal Caribbean ($RCL) were still reporting large losses in the last couple of quarters. In fact, the forecast is for Carnival to report another large loss for the just ended May quarter due to the inclusion of March in the quarterly results.

In essence, the airlines are far ahead of the cruise lines in the travel recovery, but oddly the stocks have underperformed. For the YTD period, Royal Caribbean and Carnival have seen share price gains of ~93% versus the solid, but much smaller, 28% gain for Delta.

The amazing part is that Delta has forecast a return to near record EPS in 2024. The airline is forecasting an EPS of up $6 this year for a stock trading at only $42 now.

While Royal Caribbean has a goal of hitting a record EPS in 2025, the cruise line is only now starting to generate profits. Carnival has no such plan to return to record profits anytime soon, but the stock has rallied anyway.

A prime example of the disconnect here are the forward PE ratios. Delta trades at only 6x PE targets while Royal Caribbean is now up at 14x and Carnival trades at a market multiple of 19x.

The share price move is strange considering Delta is in a better financial position, having returned to positive cash flows sooner. Logic would say the casino is missing an obvious big play in $DAL.

-Check The Balance Sheet-
A big key to the forecasts of Delta is the return to large positive cash flows. Previously, the airline returned billions in capital to shareholders annually via mainly stock buybacks and now these cash flows will repay debt.

Delta ended Q1 with net debt of $15.4 billion, but the company still has debt far above pre-covid levels. The airline forecasts a combination of lower capex and higher income, leading to over $6 billion in positive cash flows through the end of 2024 to drive net debt far lower.

The airline should end 2024 with net debt back towards the early 2020 levels. Delta Air Lines should generate $4+ billion in annual free cash flows starting in 2024, leaving the airline with the options of either pushing towards positive cash balances or starting to repurchase extremely cheap shares here.

One of the biggest aspects missed by the business return to normalization is that the loyalty plan offers a huge revenue boost over 2019 levels. Delta works with American Express ($AXP) on Delta Skymiles and the remuneration from the plan has grown from $4 billion in 2019 to a goal of $7+ billion in 2024.

These high margin revenues provide a huge upside to the potential profits versus the $7.33 earned back in 2019. As the interest expenses are cut back to pre-covid levels or lower, investors should start looking at the potential for Delta to earn $8 to $9 per share in 2025 and beyond.

-TL;DR-
The key investor takeaway is that Delta remains cheap. The stock should trade at an equivalent, or higher, forward PE multiple than the cruise lines. The airline remains on a solid path to hitting the $7+ EPS target in 2024 and the stock should ultimately follow the debt repayments Delta will undertake in the next year to much higher prices.

Falling energy prices and the AMEX remunerations are additional catalysts for faster profits and cash flow.

With business travel well on pace for a full recovery, it is defying some predictions that it would take until at least 2024 for a complete comeback. Leisure travel has already regained its full strength, showcasing a robust resurgence in the sector. So why the beaten down share price?

Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, should be aiding Delta. Given this positive, DAL anticipates earnings per share for full-year 2023 between $5 and $6. Total revenues (adjusted) are expected to increase in the 15-20% range on a year over year basis… and on track to surpass 2019 levels (pre-COIVD).

Free cash flow of more than $2 billion is expected in 2023. Operating margin for 2023 is expected in the 10-12% range. DAL's liquidity position is an added positive. These numbers are off-the-charts, and likely to get a lot of attention come July when they release financials.

On the flip side, yes…higher fuel prices can impact DAL's bottom line. However, DAL expects June quarter's earnings per share to be $2 - $2.25; which is well above levels seen in years.

DAL current share price is currently below expectations for the year and is very undervalued. Any wrinkled brains have any wisdom to share on DAL?

TL;DR; DAL fundamentals appear strong. Price targets and EPS expectations are high. Valuation is remarkably low. YOLO?",2023-06-12,17,24

vwno8q_DAL,DAL,DAL (Delta Airlines) looks like a good bet,"Airlines stock are cyclical, but Delta Airlines is at its lowest. It had a good Q2, earnings statement is due tomorrow. Q2 is usually the best quarter for airlines, anyway. Oil prices were pretty high last quarter, but nosedived earlier this month, so Q3 forecast looks good (it'd be better than the forward guidance). Pilot compensation had to go up at some point, and it already seems to be factored in. Recession fears for the US economy do exist, but even if we have a recession, it would be a mild one, and shorter too.

Even if DAL goes to 35 after its Q3 results, that's a 19.5% upside in 3 more months!!!!Even if that takes a year, 19.5% in a year is not bad (for me)!

I would've also gone for American Airlines (AAL) stock, which is trading quite low (sub-$14), but American Airlines has a lot of debt, so it's a risky bet. Also, I know that people like Delta more than any of the 3 largest airlines (American, Delta, United), because Delta does things a bit better than the rest, so I'm expecting Delta to rebound later this year. Probably wait until tomorrow to buy, but I already have.

Shares of **Delta Air Lines** (NYSE:[DAL](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/DAL#NYSE)) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $31.23.

12:52 PM EDT, 09/04/2020 (MT Newswires) -- American Airlines Group's (AAL) basic economy bookings increased in June, mostly from passengers under 30 years old, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja. Raja said up to 85% of its June passengers booked the cheapest fare class. According to the report, American Airlines plans to beef up its basic economy fares from Oct. 1, with upgrade options, more leg room and priority boarding to make them more attractive to passengers.

ilmd2k_DAL,DAL,"Moving from cash to DAL, LUV?","I originally sold a number of positions, converting to largely cash when the DJIA bounced back to \~26k after the initial COVID-19 drop. That included selling about 2000 shares of AMD at \~55...shares I originally purchased at \~3 (yea...ouch, but hey, I did fairly well long-term). The markets just felt too irrational. 

Anyways, I'm looking for another long term bet since I'm feeling too antsy holding cash. Most things look terribly overvalued right now. I get it, rates are basically 0, retail investors, etc etc. I still feel like a near/mid-term downturn is more likely than this continued meteoric rise. 

So considering the above, DAL and LUV feel like stocks that are still severely depressed compared to the rest of the market. They're the ""big boys"" of US airlines. They're still impacted by COVID-19 for obvious reasons. But with increasing talk of a vaccine before EOY, they're starting to look like long-term value plays. And if the market did take a downturn, I feel like they're actually a safer bet because their value is already so depressed. I also think that if there were a downturn, there would be no decline in current levels of travel because people are starting to feel cabin fever, and that's only going to worsen as winter arrives (I live in Minnesota).

* Schools are reopening in China, Japan, Germany, and others ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/coronavirus-countries-schools-education-covid19-reopen-classroom/)).

# Strategy

I purchased strikes for DEC 20 around $10-$15 above the current value. I think the prices will bounce before that date. I intend to take advantage of that by selling before the expiration date while IV is high and the options still have extrinsic value.

The option premium or price?? seems to be 4.73. 

I have the following questions. Please please help me with it before I commit. 

1) Do I pay 4.73 x 100 = $473 now to purchase this option or 4.73? 

2) If DAL goes up to say $27 by June 18, the option will be useless to me. Can I just let it expire? Am I liable for any other costs? I’m asking cos I always see people saying in options, the losses are unlimited. 

3) If DAL crashes to $15 by June 18, do I literally have to buy 100 DAL shares at $15 and sell it to the option writer at $25? Do I then make the difference of $10 x 100? How would I do that? Would the brokerage ask me what my instructions are? Or are there a lot of forms to fill? 

4) Can I just choose to sell the option to someone instead of going through the hassle of buying the shares and selling?

5) Lastly, since I’m long in DAL, of course I hope it goes up. But I just want some insurance. Isn’t $473 too expensive as an insurance? Is there a better way of doing this? Should I just sell my DAL shares and forget about it?",2020-04-23,2,5

Earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) will take center stage Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel demand got hammered over recent months and major U.S. airlines have had to slash capacity in an attempt to preserve cash. Investors will be focusing on commentary from Delta’s management Wednesday morning for any updates on how the company is dealing with the ongoing pandemic.

&#x200B;

Delta is expected to report and adjusted LOSS per share of 87 cents on $9.19 billion in revenue during Q1. On April 4, Delta said that it was burning through $60 million of cash per day and expected second-quarter revenue to fall 90%. Much like the rest of the companies reporting this earnings season, Delta’s big picture and guidance will matter more much than the company’s financial results during the previous quarter.",2020-04-22,2,46

g540x4_DAL,DAL,DAL Stock will FLY Post-Earnings (DAL 4/24 $35 Call),"New to the community here but figured I'd share my perspectives on Delta.

**Delta Airlines Thesis**

1. The company is currently at $23.79 and the markets have discounted the company based on pessimism and uncertainty of when things will revert back to normal
2. Unlike most U.S Airlines, Delta does not hedge fuel costs while most airlines are locked in at say fucking $67 dollars a barrel. Delta acquired a refinery in 2012 to produce jet fuel for its fleet (of which crude is an input so lower prices will lower cost)
3. Oil prices have just shit the bed, and Delta is in the perfect position to capitalize on extremely low oil prices for future profitability
4. I wager that in the earnings call conference, mgmt will have comments on how much they can potentially save
5. DAL benefitting from lower fuel prices will free up capital for future capex and fleet expansion  and investors will overlook low earnings (which has been ""priced in"")

**Disclaimer**: Not sure how airlines negotiate these future contracts especially in this fucked up macroeconomic environment but due to oversupply of oil from economic slowdown, prices should remain low.

**P.S.** Royal Caribbean, which also does not hedge fuel prices may move once markets react to DAL's release.

\_\_\_\_\_**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**EDIT1: There are 4/24 $32C priced at $0.01**

DAL 4/24 ~~$35C~~ to DAL 4/24 $32C

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**EDIT 2: A couple of caveats here after bouncing ideas off of multiple people:**

1. 4/24 $32C for $0.01 is cheap but there is reason to believe that the market has to an extent priced in earnings release so tread carefully with investing
2. My original thought was that the drop in oil price will increase profitability in the future which will drive up share price but I now think it's more of a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things
3. The fixed cost leveraging and unwinding of working capital is going to really force Delta to require government funding, and although it is an outstanding airline, government equity will dilute shareholders so the stock, has to an extent, priced that in.
4. That being said, markets are rather irrational right now given the unprecedented situation, so keep that in mind
5. Good luck everyone and I hope we all make money.",2020-04-20,34,59

My situation:
- Have money in UAL, DAL and AAL
- Have the worst position in DAL, 25 shares at 25.82. Want to improve
- Pretty sure DAL is gonna tank Monday AM

Strategy:
- I put in a Premarket Limit order .10 below the aftermarket price. Order: $25.25
- I’m okay with a $15 loss from original investment
- Plan to get back into DAL by averaging down (planning to start back in at $23).

- If it goes into a free fall, will I be able to offload 25 shares immediately at that price (.10 aftermarket price)?

I'm also hedging my SPY puts that are getting crushed last couple weeks. It still seems we will price downward over coming weeks as the economic slowdown gets priced in, so I'm staying net short in this portfolio.

So you want to short an airline. Great! You see that $DAL is an airline, with planes, that fly and stuff. I'm going to YOLO it on $DAL puts you say. Not so fast.

While I think $DAL puts will end up printing tendies, I think that $ALK is the better play. Here's why:

1. $DAL is the most financially stable American airline, and they don't have that many flights to Asia. Their international flights are through affiliate airlines like Korean Air. $DAL is a very solid company overall, even Warren Buffett, the old poopyface, just bought a bigger stake in it.
2. In contrast, $ALK is less profitable, and less stable. Their are headquartered in Seattle at SeaTac airport. Seattle is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak in the US, and you can expect to see hundreds, if not thousands of cases out of Seattle in the next month. If SeaTac shuts down, $ALK is fucked. Regardless, no sane person is going to travel to or through Seattle, it's just too risky.

It's hard to pick stocks in this market, but I think theres some margin of safety in DAL, and I'm looking for some other opinions on it. The biggest drawdown for me is that they have a negative book value if you subtract intangibles and goodwill, but there is a large moat on the industry as a whole (there being no viable alternative to air travel), and delta is an established player with monopolies on more of its routes than its competitors, and a hold on its hometown of Atlanta which is a major regional hub. Historically the industry is suicidally competitive, but with what I believe is a long term trend in the decline of gas prices, it should become a more and more profitable company.

LUV and DAL have drastically different P/E, EPS yet they're both rated Strong Buys at several sites I visit - yet other airline stocks with similar stats are rated much different.
