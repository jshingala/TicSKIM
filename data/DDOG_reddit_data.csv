1bbomnf_DDOG,DDOG,Investment idea Put on DDOG,"As you all know, the market is at all-time high levels and popular stocks like the largest of the S&P 500 have an uncharacteristically high P/E rating. According to Howard Marcs, the pendulum is swinging further to the bullish side.  

&#x200B;

In summary, stocks are expensive right now and obviously the conclusion is that maybe shorting stocks now would be a good idea  

&#x200B;

 But what are the criteria and considerations? 

&#x200B;

I created a screener that filters out stocks with a P/E ratio above 100 and then searched through stocks. My criteria were that I don't take companies with a strong earnings growth rate because they are more likely to have earned this valuation and can quickly grow into their valuation from the market so I avoided stocks like Nvidia 

&#x200B;

Case study:  

&#x200B;

I found Datadog inc (DDOG), a company that produces software for companies, which is not a bad company with an average revenue growth rate of 62% over the last 5 years. Nevertheless, Datadog suffers from high operating expenses so that it has been making losses since the company entered the market. And to finance their activities they issue more shares to raise money which makes the individual share worthless. But to understand this case mathematically, let's build a bull case to understand how overvalued the stock is. Let's assume that the company's revenue grows 50% next year and somehow they manage to turn -1.6% net profit margin into 10% net margin which would be 319 million earnings in 2024 and about 0.96 cents EPS with what with the current price 125 dollars would result in a P/E ratio of 125 at the end of 2024 where the company would still grow unrealistically and you can also say that the company simply reinvests a lot in itself but the current TEV/EBITDA is also 65 which is extremely expensive.  

&#x200B;

So in conclusion I would say that I personally think that the problems like an unprofitable company and the risks like stopping growth are just not included in the price at all and therefore I buy a put option which expires in more than one year according to my previous calculation I say that the intrinsic value of the company is maybe 64 and I sell my put when the price is at 110 which should give me a good risk and I think that the price will probably fall below 110 dollar.

&#x200B;

What do you think of my theory let me have criticism and tips",2024-03-10,0,17

15ln8yr_DDOG,DDOG,Datadog's ($DDOG) Stock Plummets more than 20%: What Went Wrong?,"**Datadog, Inc. (DDOG)** shares faced a significant drop in Tuesday's premarket trading.

**Why the Stock Dropped:**
The decline in Datadog's stock can be attributed to the company's revenue forecast falling short of expectations for the rest of the year.

Although Q2 results showed improvements and topped expectations, the Q3 and full-year outlook missed analyst forecasts, causing investor concerns and leading to the 20% drop in the stock.

**Q3 Forecast:**
- **Revenue:** $521 million to $525 million (below consensus of $536 million).
- **Adjusted EPS:** 33 to 35 cents (above consensus of 29 cents).

**Full-Year Outlook:**
- **Revenue:** $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion (analysts expected $2.24 billion).
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.30 to $1.34 (analysts expected $1.18).

**Q2 Performance:**
- **Net Loss:** $4.0 million, improving from a loss of $4.88 million YoY.
- **Adjusted EPS:** 36 cents (analysts expected 28 cents).
- **Revenue:** $509.5 million, up 25% YoY (above consensus of $501.6 million).

**Customers:** Around **2,990** customers with annual recurring revenue over $100,000.

CEO Olivier Pomel highlighted strong Q2 execution, with robust revenue growth, customer increase, and multi-product adoption. However, the revenue forecast shortfall for the rest of the year led to the stock's decline.",2023-08-08,20,20

12lu0z1_DDOG,DDOG,Datadog Inc. Investment Thesis,"Datadog, Inc. (Ticker: DDOG) went public on September 19, 2019, raising over $640 million through an initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at $10.7 billion. Interestingly, before its IPO, Datadog reportedly rejected an acquisition offer of more than $7 billion from Cisco ([Source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-18/cisco-is-said-to-have-bid-7-billion-plus-for-datadog-before-ipo?leadSource=uverify%20wall)). Since its IPO, Datadog's market capitalisation has doubled to $21.8 billion.¬†

What makes Datadog such a highly sought-after investment in the cloud technology industry, that it could reject a multi-billion dollar acquisition offer and is it worth investing in today?

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $53.8M to $57.9M (+7%)
* Sales increased from $665M to $1.08B (+63%)
* Transactions increased from 420 to 436 (+4%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 220 to 236 (+7%)
   * Net buyers increased from 15 to 35 (+133%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 205 to 201 (-2%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 362 to 355 (-2%)
   * Net buyers increased from 34 to 44 (+44%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 328 to 306 (-7%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **January 23rd - January 27th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **January 16th - January 20th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Other Updates

1. Check out our content on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FormFore) if you're interested in a regular stream of stats on Form 4 filings.
2. I'm updating our site in the background and will be rolling that out in the next few weeks.

lhqeh9_DDOG,DDOG,DDOG - Earnings report coming. Stock is overvalued.,"I'm not a financial advisor, I live in the UK, I have a small position in the stock (which I am closing) and I build tools for stock analysis.

I've read and become familiar with datadog, including it's last four quarters worth of results and their coming predictions for the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings report is coming out after close today.

If you're unsure about what datadog do - they are a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications.

The hit of the pandemic wasn't really an issue for them - sure, technology companies and cloud providers are tightening their belts, but when everything is moving towards home-working, there is a serious requirement for cloud monitoring and security when your business is becoming more de-centralized, a reality that creates more attack vectors for businesses.

This all points to good news for datadog, but they are still waiting for secure approval from federal level, which comes with quite the boost some cloud providers would be seeking.   

I have no doubt their revenue is probably about the level they predicted. A 5.3% increase from last quarter. The share price on the other hand has hit about 34% increase from the same time. The company is investing in rapid growth, with big spends in R&D. They're a great company and if you go long on this position then it will undoubtedly hit these numbers and above based on their GAAP, but at current I do not anticipate the earnings reports to shine anything that will justify this share price.",2021-02-11,14,10

j4yvkx_DDOG,DDOG,"Unusual Option Activity Summary for the week: DDOG, PINS, SFIX, ZNGA, MAC, VNQ, CNP","Swaggy is back with some unusual options activity that was spotted last week. We‚Äôll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

**DDOG**

DDOG was fairly active last week after the stock jumped 15% on the news of a deal with MSFT. One would assume the MSFT deal will be huge in terms of size and might attract more clients for DDOG. Most of the flow was pretty short-term (2-3 weeks) expecting the stock to continue it‚Äôs upward momentum. October 16 and November 20 were the common expiration dates with most plays being out-the-money.

**PINS**

PINS saw some BIG buyers on Thursday as players expect the stock to perform well in the short-term. Players were buying strikes all across the board with each position being in the range of 3,000-7,000 contracts a piece. The largest positions were $4-5 million. Pretty heavy bullish flow, will definitely add this ticker in my stocks to watch this week. PINS will be reporting earnings toward the end of the month of October.

**SFIX**

SFIX the e-commerce fashion brand with a subscription model for receiving fitted clothes. A stock with generally low volume in option flow saw some huge buys coming in. Biggest positions were for the December 2020 expiration, long calls and put-selling makes it for some heavily bullish sentiment. SFIX is set to report earnings 1 week before these options expire, so IV will be relatively high for that expiration date. If you go 2 weeks earlier you will be able to find ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù options that don‚Äôt include the earnings report.

**ZNGA**

ZNGA saw a few big plays roll thru on Friday an hour before close. Option flow sentiment this week has been higher than normal and quite bullish. Some of the bigger plays were for over 10k contracts a piece, call-buying AND put-selling. ZNGA reports at the end of October.

https://preview.redd.it/sex9xd34x2r51.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdca52e7e0ac9f3b0517e681d84fa86b25dd1311

**MAC**

Macerich Company (MAC) was another name with some bullish option flow. The stock has been on a steady downtrend over the last 3 months dropping to a low in the $6.75 range. Thursday around the time the stock started to show some strength a big purchase of 3,200 calls came through for March 2021 expiration. I like these longer-term plays when I see them because it gives the player a bit more time for everything to turn out how they expect. MAC continued to rally up 6% on Friday, so the player has already earned a decent amount so far.

**VNQ**

Vanguard Real Estate (VNQ) had some players buying the dip over the last week when the stock dropped to $76 range. Looks like most action was put-selling expecting the the stock to get back above $80-81 in the next month or two. Since the action already happened the stock is up 10% and already trading at $81. Have we missed the boat on this one? Maybe, but interesting to see how these ‚Äúbig‚Äù plays end up working out more often than not.

**CNP**

I saved the most unusual for last, CenterPoint Energy (CNP). A player opened a SHORT STRANGLE where they SOLD both a call and put position. They sold the $20.5 strike calls, as well as sold the $19 strike puts to collect a total premium of $700k. This strategy is a THETA play where they expect little movement in the stock price until expiration in 4 weeks time. In theory if the player realizes max profit he will have made $35k per day that the market was open (from the time position was opened to option expiration).

Reddit seems to love NET and FSLY, but I have trouble understanding their business models and the risk vs reward opportunities when compared to peers.

Both NET and FSLY are trading at arguably high valuations, but so is most of the Tech sector and that hasn't stopped it from going higher.

Looking at the financials for some of these companies, the revenues aren't anything special, but the market caps are in the billions.

Can anyone justify the valuations here even after the drop we've had? Does getting in on NET, FSLY, or DDOG make sense here, or is this a hype play that's now deflating?",2020-09-04,6,28

hjmxrq_DDOG,DDOG,"Today's Unusual Options Activity Tickers: BMY, DXC, PTON, AMZN, DDOG + charts & data","Here‚Äôs some of the flow I that really caught my attention today and was on my watchlist.

**BMY ‚Äì Bristol Myers**

Looks like player opened up a synthetic short position by selling July 17 calls for a credit of $190k, and player purchased July 17 puts for $3.1 million in premium. Each leg in the position was opened at the $62.5 strike. Essentially this position compares very closely to a short stock position. This option flow stood out as there is not normally large activity going through this stock.

https://preview.redd.it/kdt8o06aac851.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f8a5039bc44422100af03ac3dc7e3a473106560

**DXC ‚Äì DXC Technology**

Saw something very interesting today in DXC. For a stock ticker that has relatively low option volume we saw an enormous position opened today. A player sold 93,000 August 21 calls at $17 strike for a credit of $16 million and opened 93,000 August 21 puts at $16 strike paying a premium of $18 million. The 93,000 volume on these options compares to the only 200 OI for the same strikes. DXC is a small cap stock with a market cap of only $4 billion. A trade of this size would be classified as extremely unusual.

\*After doing some research it seems this position is tied to $150 million stock position. Then you need to ask yourself, why would you sell a covered call and enter a long PUT position if you have a large position in shares. Seems like someone knows something is up and is expecting a big drop soon.

[Here's a Yahoo Finance link to the option chain, although they don't have the strike for the PUT contracts available for some weird reason](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DXC/options?p=DXC&date=1597968000)

**AMZN ‚Äì Amazon Inc**

There wasn‚Äôt anything specifically unusual about any trades in AMZN. There was a lot of smaller long positions opened with near-term expiration for tomorrow or next week. Seems like a lot of players were riding the momentum throughout the day and also caused more buying pressure that pushed the stock up. AMZN had good momentum for most of the day and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was from the call activity.
