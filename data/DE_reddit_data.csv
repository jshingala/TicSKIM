No solo para decidir con más cabeza, sino para revisarlas en frío cuando el mercado se pone tenso. Me he montado un programita para tener todo ordenado: empresa, sector, fechas clave, KPIs, notas… y la verdad es que me está ayudando bastante a mantener el foco.

Ahora intento que cada tesis tenga, como mínimo:

* Un resumen claro del negocio y por qué me interesa
* Una valoración actual frente al potencial (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.)
* Catalizadores 
* Riesgos clave 
* directiva: si han cumplido, si tienen acciones, si comunican bien
* KPIs que quiero seguir en cada presentación de resultados
* red flags que me harían replantear la inversión
* Objetivos de valoración a 1, 3 y 5 años

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The United States will cut the ""de minimis"" tariff for low-value items imported from China, a White House executive order said on Monday, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The tariff relief, which affects big Chinese e-commerce players including Shein and Temu, follows a deal between Beijing and Washington to unwind most of the duties imposed on each other's goods since early April, after weekend talks in Geneva.

While their joint statement in Geneva didn't mention the de minimis duties, the White House order released later said the levies will be reduced to 54% from 120% for items valued at up to $800 sent from China via postal services, with a flat fee of $100 to remain, starting from May 14.

Carriers can pay either the 54% or the $100 fee per package, industry experts said. The logistics companies or freight forwarders collect those tariff fees from sellers in China in advance.

The de minimis exemption allowed items valued at up to $800 and sent from China via postal service to previously enter the United States duty free and with minimal inspections.

In February, President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption by imposing a tax of 120% of the package's value or a planned flat fee of $200 - set to come into effect by June - blaming it for being heavily used by companies such as Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.

The number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.

According to 2024 congressional testimony from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just $54.

Chinese online retailers Shein - which is considering a London stock market listing - PDD Holdings-owned Temu and U.S. rival Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In Monday's order, the White House said the reduced tariffs will take effect by 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on May 14, 2025.

The plan for a $200 flat fee duty rate would also be shelved, it said, keeping it at $100.

China exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.

Jianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said 54% was still very high.

""Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it's fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the U.S., the Golden Age is already gone.""

Shein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu.

Shein might still be one player that would want to air freight some packages from China and pay the 54% tariffs rather than import all by boat, said Hu.

""If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?""

LOOPHOLE

China's yuan jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.

Trump's global trade war, which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession.

The U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

Some have derided it as a loophole that allows cheap Chinese products to flood into the United States and undercut American industries, while also serving as cover for smuggling contraband such as illegal drugs and their precursor chemicals.

De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance which describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs, was one of the most generous exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156).

The Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both the United States and China by 115 percentage points each, to 10% and 30%, respectively, for at least 90 days.

BREATHING ROOM

The tariff pause will give online retailers like Shein and Temu breathing space to adapt their businesses, say industry experts, as online retailers are likely to use the time to bring in bulk shipments and restock their U.S. warehouses.

Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba's AliExpress. Their growth prompted Amazon to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.

""I think companies that were part of the cross-border boom from China will still want to diversify their business away from the U.S. as much as they can. Everyone has already realised if you depend on the US, it's too risky,"" said Hu of Brands Factory.

Separately, China has removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes in the wake of the Geneva trade deal, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Officials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of aircraft made in the United States can resume, Bloomberg said.",2025-05-13,97,53

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., May 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**SS Innovations International, Inc.**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u3BgzIQ7W6gaaNsksAWiO5_3u-zGn7J115dtO8yObSQEK9bGZmyaw8whtfwqqSWJvLvOCmDKwvV5GFDJ068VW7XpxC8bJsBjdYwdOBKIVe0GVioTN9GdkfTPsBKaKxGc) (the “Company” or “SS Innovations”) (Nasdaq: SSII), a developer of innovative surgical robotic technologies dedicated to making robotic surgery affordable and accessible to a global population, today announced that the Company is planning to submit a De Novo Classification Request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the SSi Mantra 3 surgical robotic system (the “SSi Mantra 3”) in July 2025.   

If approved by the FDA, the SSi Mantra 3 would be cleared to market in the United States. Submission of the De Novo Classification Request does not guarantee FDA approval.

Since the Company began the sale of its system in August 2022 it has installed a total of 80 SSi Mantra robotic surgical systems in 75 hospitals and over 3,800 surgeries have been performed, including over 200 robotic cardiac surgeries. The SSi Mantra 3 version was launched in June 2024, and the Company has already installed 37 systems that have been utilized to perform more than 750 multispecialty robotic surgical procedures, including 70 cardiac cases, with no device related mortality, injury or complications.      

Real world clinical data, validated by a leading contract research organization (“CRO”), supports the ability of the SSi Mantra 3 to safely perform a wide variety of surgical procedures. The planned submission of the SSi Mantra 3 to the FDA will include an application for multispecialty indications including urology, gynecology, general surgery, and thoracic and cardiac surgery.

Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of SS Innovations, commented, “We currently have approval to market our SSi Mantra surgical robotic system in six countries and continue to advance our global expansion. We are taking important steps, including the planned De Novo application to the FDA, to introduce our empowering, cost-effective surgical robotic technology to the U.S. market. In parallel, we are pursuing European Union CE Mark approval for our SSi Mantra surgical robotic system and look forward to our future with great confidence.”",2025-05-08,0,1

1kdag48_DE,DE,Temu halts shipping direct from China as de minimis tariff loophole is cut off,"Bargain Chinese retailer Temu changed its business model in the U.S. as the Trump administration’s new rules on low-value shipments took effect on Friday.

In recent days, Temu has abruptly shifted its website and app to only display listings for products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. Items shipped directly from China, which previously blanketed the site, are now labeled as out of stock.

Temu made a name for itself in the U.S. as a destination for ultra-discounted items shipped direct from China, such as $5 sneakers and $1.50 garlic presses. It’s been able to keep prices low because of the so-called de minimis rule, which has allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free since 2016.

The loophole expired Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT as a result of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April. Trump briefly suspended the de minimis rule in February before reinstating the provision days later as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a mountain of low-value packages.

The end of de minimis, as well as Trump’s new 145% tariffs on China, has forced Temu to raise prices, suspend its aggressive online advertising push and now alter the selection of goods available to American shoppers to circumvent higher levies.

A Temu spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that all sales in the U.S. are now handled by local sellers and fulfilled “from within the country” as part of the company’s efforts to improve service levels. It said pricing for U.S. shoppers “remains unchanged.”

“Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” the spokesperson said. “The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.”

Before the change, shoppers that attempted to purchase Temu products shipped from China were confronted with “import charges” between 130% and 150%. The fees often cost more than the individual item and more than doubled the price of many orders.

Temu advertises that local products have “no import charges” and “no extra charges upon delivery.”

The company, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has gradually built up its inventory in the U.S. over the past year in anticipation of escalating trade tensions and the removal of de minimis.

Shein, which has also benefited from the loophole, moved to raise prices last week. The fast-fashion retailer added a banner at checkout that states, “Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You’ll never have to pay extra at delivery.”

Many third-party sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese manufacturers to source or assemble their products. The company’s Temu competitor, called Amazon Haul, has relied on de minimis to ship products priced at $20 or less directly from China to the U.S.

Amazon said this week following a dustup with the White House that it considered showing tariff-related costs on Haul products ahead of the de minimis cutoff. It’s since scrapped those plans.

Prior to Trump’s second term in office, the Biden administration had also looked to curtail the provision. Critics of the de minimis provision argue that it harms American businesses and facilitates shipments of fentanyl and other illicit substances on the claims that the packages are less likely to be inspected by customs agents.

1ka1i4n_DE,DE,Why am I short on $DE (John Deere & Co.),"
My decision to short John Deere (Deere & Co.) stock in light of recent tariffs can be explained through several key economic factors that directly affect the company’s profitability and market position.

John Deere, like many manufacturing companies, relies on imported raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and other metals. Recent tariffs, particularly those imposed on imports from countries like China, have led to an increase in the cost of these materials. As a result, the company's production costs have risen, which could erode its profit margins.

John Deere has a significant presence in global markets, including China, where demand for high-quality agricultural machinery is growing. However, if tariffs are levied on U.S. exports, this would make John Deere’s products more expensive compared to locally produced machinery. Higher prices would likely reduce the company's competitiveness in these international markets, potentially leading to lower sales volumes.

In response to increased production costs, John Deere will raise prices on its equipment. While this might not immediately affect sales, over time, higher prices could deter customers, particularly in price-sensitive markets. This decline in demand could further strain the company’s performance.

With rising input costs and potentially reduced sales from both domestic and international markets, John Deere’s profit margins could be negatively impacted. Lower profitability often leads to reduced earnings projections, which in turn could put downward pressure on the stock price.

Tariffs typically generate uncertainty, especially for companies with significant global exposure like John Deere. If investors perceive the tariffs as a threat to the company’s profitability, market sentiment may turn negative, leading to increased selling activity and a potential decline in the stock price.

Given the anticipated rise in production costs, reduced international sales, and shrinking profit margins, there is a reasonable expectation that John Deere’s stock price could fall in response to ongoing tariff pressures. If investors begin to anticipate a decline in earnings and overall profitability, shorting the stock could provide an opportunity to profit from a potential downturn in the stock price.

In summary, the imposition of tariffs will increase production costs, reduce export competitiveness, and potentially lower consumer demand for John Deere’s products. These factors, coupled with the potential for shrinking profit margins and negative investor sentiment, could lead to a decline in the company's stock price, making it a candidate for short-selling in the current economic climate.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday put the responsibility for reaching a trade agreement on China.

""I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,"" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

The comments come with markets on edge over the direction of tariffs following President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of broad-based global duties. A week later, Trump said he would keep in place 10% across-the-board tariffs but table for 90 days more aggressive levies against individual trading partners.

Since then, the U.S. has made progress in negotiations, Bessent said, singling out India for a potential deal in coming days.

""I would guess that India would be one of the first trade deals we would sign. So watch this space,"" he said.

In addition to his assessment of the situation with China and other Asian countries, Bessent charged that European nations are likely ""in a panic"" over the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar since the trade tensions began. The euro has risen nearly 10% this year against the greenback after the currencies had reached near parity in early January.

""You're going to see the [European Central Bank] start cutting rates to try to get the Euro back down,"" Bessent said. ""Europeans don't want a strong euro. We have a strong-dollar policy.""

Administration officials have sent mixed signals recently regarding the state of negotiations.

Trump last week said he was talking with Chinese officials about trade as they visited Washington. However, other reports indicated that negotiations were not taking place as the officials instead were in town for the World Bank and International Monetary Foundation meetings.

Bessent insisted that the White House will not be conducting negotiations in the press.

White House Considers Slashing China Tariffs to De-escalate Trade War
Levies could be cut by more than half in some cases although President Trump hasn’t yet made a final decision

The Trump administration is considering slashing its steep tariffs on Chinese imports—in some cases by more than half—in a bid to de-escalate tensions with Beijing that have roiled global trade and investment, according to people familiar with the matter.
President Trump hasn’t made a final determination, the people said, adding that the discussions remain fluid and several options are on the table.
One senior White House official said the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America’s interest, some of the people said. The bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump said Tuesday he was willing to cut tariffs on Chinese goods, saying the 145% tariffs he imposed on China during his second term would come down. “But it won’t be zero,” he said. The development was welcomed news to investors who had been spooked by the White House’s aggressive moves in recent weeks. 
China on Wednesday signaled it was open to trade talks with the U.S., though Beijing warned it wouldn’t negotiate under continued threats from the White House. In China’s policymaking circles, Trump’s comments Tuesday were viewed as a sign of him folding, people who consult with Chinese officials said.
The expressions of openness to a deal from both sides represent a shift from much of the past month, as the world’s two largest economies exchanged reciprocal tariff increases and testy words, helping push stock markets around the world to their worst weeks in many years.
The administration had planned to use ongoing tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. trading partners to limit their dealings with China, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said there is room for talks on a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. Such talks would have to involve Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, though the two haven’t talked since Trump regained the White House.

Also, in 2022 the US exported more than 35B in value for agriculture to China.

So if the trade war with China continues, US farmers will not only have to pay more for farming equipment, but they will also lose the ability to sell their GMO franken-crops to the number 1 export trade partner for agriculture.

1iauoyr_DE,DE,John Deere: An American Stalwart,"What’s more American than Levi’s blue jeans and apple pie?

Well, honestly, probably nothing, but John Deere is in contention. Few brands have left a bigger cultural mark on rural America than Deere. Throughout America’s heartland and from coast to coast, people proudly don hats with Deere’s signature logo and green & yellow branding, while inheriting Deere equipment is something of a rite of passage for the next generation of family farmers nationwide. 🚜🌾

But Deere isn’t just some old-timey, blue-collar brand; it’s a tech company, a manufacturer, and a financial services business all wrapped into one. And the tech focus is an increasingly large part of the story.

More below on everything you could ever want to know about Deere’s iconic brand, business, valuation, and whether it earns a spot in our exclusive Intrinsic Value portfolio of attractively priced, high-quality stocks — in just a few minutes to read. 	

**John Deere: Good Ol’ American Ingenuity**

Deere’s story begins nearly 200 years ago when John Deere himself established the company in Illinois in 1837 after designing a steel plow that was far better suited for the sticky soil of the Midwest Prairie than the more common cast-iron plows of the day.

Deere distinguished himself further by not just designing a better plow but also by embracing a more commercial mindset. Instead of humbly waiting for someone to order a plow to start building it, he realized that he could improve the customer experience by building his plows in advance, storing them as inventory, and then delivering them as soon as a customer had finalized the purchase. This had the added benefit of enabling prospective customers to see and try the plows for themselves before purchasing.

Word of Deere’s improved and easy-to-purchase plows spread across the corn belt, and he was soon selling hundreds and eventually thousands of plows each year.

A few years later, John Deere adopted its iconic leaping-Deer logo, but it wasn’t until 1918 that the company began producing what it’s most famous for now: tractors.

Tractors are the lifeblood of John Deere, though the company has grown to become a giant in the broader agricultural, forestry, and construction industries. Deere’s reputation for quality across product lines has long preceded it, too, driven by the now-famous tagline “Nothing Runs Like a Deere.”

But this marketing magic almost never was. The story goes that as a last-ditch effort, an advertising agency copywriter rifled through discarded headline ideas in his trash can for Deere’s new line of snowmobiles — only to then re-discover what would become a staple of one of the world’s most recognizable brands.

Yet, we are here to discuss John Deere as an investment in 2025. Surely, if we could spin back the clocks 100 years, we all would have invested in it (you’d actually have to spin back the clock 113 years to 1912 to participate in its New York Stock Exchange IPO.)

**Tech Company?**

Still, to survive and thrive for as long as Deere has as a company is telling of its continued quality and winning culture. Deere today still sells heavy machinery, but its focus is increasingly on cutting-edge technology.

These are not ‘dumb’ machines that Deere sells. We’re talking about equipment so productive and important that it underpins the very existence of our modern world. Using less land and labor than ever, machines like the ones Deere makes have made farming increasingly sophisticated at keeping billions of people fed.

Starlink-powered satellite internet, advanced GPS systems, machine vision to identify weeds and damaged crops in real-time, autonomous self-driving and electric tractors, planters that can shoot out over 1,000 seeds per second, and a virtual command center mapping out everything happening across a farmer’s acreage — this is what I mean when I say Deere is much more high-tech than you might first think.

Deere’s See & Spray technology can, as mentioned, recognize weeds or diseased crops on a second-to-second basis and then spray the perfect portion of herbicide to kill the unwanted flora, reducing the amount of herbicide farmers use by as much as two-thirds.

Deere’s equipment has thousands of sensors that work together to form a digital map of a farm, which can then be used for simulating different scenarios and making recommendations to farmers on the most optimal ways to do things, from the most efficient path to drive their tractors on to the types of crops they should grow or how to respond to weather events.

This [video](https://youtu.be/bqOdLFvhCas?utm_source=intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=john-deere-an-american-stalwart&_bhlid=d349f294cdf8f55e1e6a5deecae9460baf8670c8) is a great illustration of Deere’s tech at work.

From a business perspective, Deere’s machinery pays for itself by saving farmers on costs elsewhere (fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, time, etc.). So, farmers need to upgrade their equipment every few years to stay up-to-date on the latest efficiency-enhancing technology since cost is the primary thing they compete on in commodity production.

But all of these software offerings fundamentally change Deere’s business model from machine sales & maintenance to recurring subscription revenues, data packages, and high-tech equipment add-ons.

([See breakdown of costs for farmers](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFVkn-YDKsnrQJjbhGs9ri44KKDjPKAFurg9XA61Ad-hkKE-Rdko3byvBDxtOk9mFlMEd31eUtXClqi5tkgrrBd9QEKOZqsCESr-sq-KW1Pim5p9vBY8D3QVksn8exqm_nDtJEvQ?key=45tN344jTHGjcrDsjQqfSYpl).)

While Deere’s business has always been cyclical, as farmers collectively delay major purchases in ‘bad years’ when poor weather, crop disease, or interest rates make it a less-than-ideal time to \~ pay the price of a new house \~ for an updated piece of equipment, software subscriptions are generating higher-margin and more recurring revenues that nerf some of the undesirable fluctuations in the company’s business.

By 2030, Deere’s management hopes that 40% of its revenues will come from recurring services, including routine parts sales and maintenance, as well as subscriptions.

That maintenance and servicing is a big part of the story: Deere’s competitive advantage lies, in part, in its vast network of dealerships, particularly in the U.S. but also worldwide, which makes it comparatively far more convenient to own a Deere since a dealership is never too far away to assist.

Farmers work on tight margins with compressed periods (tilling, planting, harvesting) to cram their work into, so they cannot afford to have important equipment offline for extended durations. And as tractors and combines have gotten more advanced, the more specialized it has become to service them, making it all the more important to be able to quickly have maintenance done.

**Financial Services?**

([See DE's Revenue breakdown](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1072f852-5ee8-4be1-b087-510b75a89339/image.png?t=1732651825).)

Beyond the promises of a tech-led transition that can materially improve the quality of Deere’s business (in terms of profit margins and recurring-ness/reliability), Deere has long run a financial services division that generates a bit less than 8% of its revenues.

This in-house financing serves solely to drive more equipment sales and, again, is a competitive advantage in a way. Given that we’ve already established a large piece of farm equipment could cost as much as or more than a new house, being able to provide loans directly to farmers hugely streamlines the purchasing process compared with having to get a loan from a local bank.

Since Deere isn’t actually a bank, its Financial Services division has to effectively borrow money from others, fortunately at very low interest rates — thanks to Deere & Co’s nearly pristine credit rating — and then lends out those funds to customers to finance equipment purchases at higher interest rates, capturing the spread between what rates they borrow and lend at as profit.

This has the added benefit of making the purchasing process easier for customers and also boosting cash conversion, as Deere Financial can ensure that the loan proceeds are used to pay Deere’s manufacturing team upfront.

In other words, Deere Financial ensures the manufacturing team is paid when products are delivered, while customers repay Deere Financial over time with interest

Having the company take on this leverage and credit risk head-on is certainly a risk, but it’s important to remember that Deere probably knows its customers better than anyone after having served farmers for almost two centuries and now collecting a vast amount of data on their operations.

Relatedly, Deere Financial is lending against the company’s own equipment as collateral. They know exactly how much a used machine is worth and that is backstopping their loans.

When you look at Deere’s balance sheet, it appears to have an inordinate amount of debt (\~$60 billion), but most of this is tied to the financial division, so Deere’s operations have a much more conservative financial position (\~$5-6 billion in net debt.)

Deere has an excellent track record in disciplined lending and has managed to do so profitably throughout the business cycle, so this isn’t a major concern for me, but any investor in the company should get comfortable with this dynamic and understand how its financial services division affects the overall business.

**Valuation**

So, where does that leave us? There’s a lot to like about Deere’s resilience, customer loyalty, brand power, and industry-leading positions in both market share and technology. Of course, we want to know how that all translates into value for shareholders who own the business.

I will say upfront that Deere is by no means an easy company to create a simple valuation for. Considering its cyclical sales, R&D spending on new technology, and financing division can all be real complicating factors.

Since Deere remains an inherently cyclical business tied to capex spending cycles for machinery, I used a framework from Aswath Damodaran — a globally revered professor of finance at NYU — for valuing cyclical companies to guide me.

In short, he advises looking at a company’s average operating margins over the last decade, which are easy to find and calculate using a service like [Finchat.io](http://Finchat.io), as shown [here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6137d31a-4a97-4a74-a97f-053cec2c867c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.21.43_PM.png?t=1732641710).

Instead of trying to guess where we are in the sales cycle for a company like Deere, you can multiply this average profit margin by whatever the company’s revenues are over the past year to get a ‘normalized’ estimate of operating profits.

With an estimate for the profits Deere’s operations can generate in a normal year, using a few variables, you can then guesstimate the present value of all of Deere’s future operating profits. The formula is a little messy, but you can view it [here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8cf0d320-0db9-423c-a671-c065b178067f/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.28.52_PM.png?t=1732642137).

The growth rate (or “g”) is the rate at which the company can grow long-term, and for the sake of conservatism, I put this in line with inflation at 2% to assume no real growth. And then, as mentioned, I just pulled the company’s historic returns on capital, tax rates, and cost of capital according to Finchat and plugged them in.

That gives a present value of the company’s lifetime operations, and then you just make some adjustments to that number by adding in cash (an asset), subtracting out debt (a liability), and dividing by the number of shares outstanding to get a target share price.

[Here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6af59533-dbe9-4661-8654-e933c54078cd/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.33.43_PM.png?t=1732642427) you’ll see the numbers I used and the value per share I got on the right.

That obviously suggests that the stock is priced too expensively today at over $450 per share, but this oversimplified model doesn’t reflect that technology and software subscriptions are structurally improving Deere’s profitability, so averaging their results over the last decade may not be the best indicator of their normalized future profit margins.

As a result, I crunched the numbers again using a revised operating margin of 20% based on what management has said they expect to average going forward, and that naturally gave a higher valuation but still suggested the stock was trading at a premium.

(See [screenshot](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/82891d87-0af3-413a-8c61-ec9b7ca06598/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.37.22_PM.png?t=1732642645) from my model).

To be even more aggressive, we could not only use management’s target average margins but also account for the fact that 2024 was a downcycle year, where revenue was only 80% of what management thinks they can earn ""mid-cycle.” So, by normalizing both revenues and margins, I can get a valuation that says the stock is slightly undervalued, but it’s a stretch:

For the record, I don’t do these exercises to generate strict price targets. Even simple models like this are fraught with assumptions. For example, slight changes to the cost of capital (aka “WACC”) can dramatically change a company’s estimated valuation, and as I’ve shown, changing the company’s average operating margin to 20% from 14% can add over $100 of estimated value per share, and there’s no simple answer for which one will be more representative of reality in the future.

[Charlie and Warren don’t exactly think highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bxyGipl8lo&utm_source=intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=john-deere-an-american-stalwart&_bhlid=cccab1fd174b17d7d6bd557edb597ab856bb254d) of relying on cost of capital calculations as discount rates, either.

As such, take that all with a grain of salt, but you’re welcome to play around with my model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NgD4RiuKZXJjdilgiJNB10HQ55OkHCTk) for illustrative purposes.

More tangibly, I like to look at the free cash flows companies can produce (this is effectively what is left over after accounting for operating expenses, reinvestments, and removing the effects of non-cash accounting adjustments.)

Free cash flows are what drive returns for stock investors implicitly or directly through dividends & share buybacks, and so the free cash flow yield (the amount of free cash flow per share relative to the price of the stock) is an important metric to look at in understanding a company’s valuation.

Deere’s free cash flow yield is around 3.6%, but if you believe management’s guidance that 2024 was a below-average year where the company earned about 80% of what it can on average over time, then the company’s ‘normalized’ FCF yield is 4.5% (3.6%/0.8).

As such, assuming Deere didn’t grow at all and its valuation multiple didn’t expand or contract, we would expect to earn an average of 4.5% per year over the next 5-10 years — derived directly from that FCF yield.

Of course, Deere will continue to grow its sales and earnings (net income grew at 15.5% per year over the last decade), and that will only enhance expected returns. If Deere can grow free cash flows by 5.5% per year going forward, adding that to the existing FCF yield already implies a 10% annual return.

And, if you really believe in Deere’s technology and ability to earn more recurring revenues, then that quality would very likely be rewarded by the market in the coming years with a higher average price-to-earnings ratio that would further boost returns beyond 10% per year.

**Portfolio Decision**

That all sounds pretty good, so why am I deciding not to add Deere to my portfolio? Deere falls into my too-hard pile.

Merit points aren’t given for working harder at finding decent investments. Hard work can certainly help you uncover opportunities, but hard work for the sake of working hard isn’t always productive, and I prefer not to make investing any harder than it already is.

That insight isn’t unique as many great investors follow the idea of having a too-hard pile, where they just can’t fully wrap their head around an investment for some reason, so instead, they just move on to the next. There are thousands and thousands of companies globally to invest in — I’m not anywhere close to having to worry about running out of options.

There are all sorts of accounting considerations for treating Deere more like a tech company, such as capitalizing spending on R&D as assets on the balance sheet rather than expensing them immediately, and the financial services division introduces a whole lot of leverage and different risk dynamics that I’m not too comfortable with, either, on top of the fact that Deere is still a cyclical company, meaning its results do not come in a straight line, up and to the right, that’s easy to value.

I grew up in the suburbs, and even though I’d heard of John Deere, something about it is less intuitive to me than Ulta, which I added to the portfolio last week. I’ve been inside Ulta stores dozens of times, I know plenty of women who love Ulta’s beauty products, and they operate a relatively straightforward retail business that doesn’t rely on technology in nearly the same way as Deere, so I feel much more comfortable thinking through the thesis with Ulta.

With Deere, I worry there’s an element of “not knowing what ya don’t know,” and there’s a lot I don’t know about agriculture. That said, I do find the company compelling, and maybe one day I will feel as though I understand Deere well enough. I wouldn't be surprised if the company earned 10%, 15%, or 20% returns per year if they really deliver some of the innovations they’ve hinted at.

But for now, I’m happy with concluding that Deere is approximately fairly valued and moving on because I’d rather miss out than get burned by a business I don’t understand.

1iauoyr_SQ,SQ,John Deere: An American Stalwart,"What’s more American than Levi’s blue jeans and apple pie?

Well, honestly, probably nothing, but John Deere is in contention. Few brands have left a bigger cultural mark on rural America than Deere. Throughout America’s heartland and from coast to coast, people proudly don hats with Deere’s signature logo and green & yellow branding, while inheriting Deere equipment is something of a rite of passage for the next generation of family farmers nationwide. 🚜🌾

But Deere isn’t just some old-timey, blue-collar brand; it’s a tech company, a manufacturer, and a financial services business all wrapped into one. And the tech focus is an increasingly large part of the story.

More below on everything you could ever want to know about Deere’s iconic brand, business, valuation, and whether it earns a spot in our exclusive Intrinsic Value portfolio of attractively priced, high-quality stocks — in just a few minutes to read. 	

**John Deere: Good Ol’ American Ingenuity**

Deere’s story begins nearly 200 years ago when John Deere himself established the company in Illinois in 1837 after designing a steel plow that was far better suited for the sticky soil of the Midwest Prairie than the more common cast-iron plows of the day.

Deere distinguished himself further by not just designing a better plow but also by embracing a more commercial mindset. Instead of humbly waiting for someone to order a plow to start building it, he realized that he could improve the customer experience by building his plows in advance, storing them as inventory, and then delivering them as soon as a customer had finalized the purchase. This had the added benefit of enabling prospective customers to see and try the plows for themselves before purchasing.

Word of Deere’s improved and easy-to-purchase plows spread across the corn belt, and he was soon selling hundreds and eventually thousands of plows each year.

A few years later, John Deere adopted its iconic leaping-Deer logo, but it wasn’t until 1918 that the company began producing what it’s most famous for now: tractors.

Tractors are the lifeblood of John Deere, though the company has grown to become a giant in the broader agricultural, forestry, and construction industries. Deere’s reputation for quality across product lines has long preceded it, too, driven by the now-famous tagline “Nothing Runs Like a Deere.”

But this marketing magic almost never was. The story goes that as a last-ditch effort, an advertising agency copywriter rifled through discarded headline ideas in his trash can for Deere’s new line of snowmobiles — only to then re-discover what would become a staple of one of the world’s most recognizable brands.

Yet, we are here to discuss John Deere as an investment in 2025. Surely, if we could spin back the clocks 100 years, we all would have invested in it (you’d actually have to spin back the clock 113 years to 1912 to participate in its New York Stock Exchange IPO.)

**Tech Company?**

Still, to survive and thrive for as long as Deere has as a company is telling of its continued quality and winning culture. Deere today still sells heavy machinery, but its focus is increasingly on cutting-edge technology.

These are not ‘dumb’ machines that Deere sells. We’re talking about equipment so productive and important that it underpins the very existence of our modern world. Using less land and labor than ever, machines like the ones Deere makes have made farming increasingly sophisticated at keeping billions of people fed.

Starlink-powered satellite internet, advanced GPS systems, machine vision to identify weeds and damaged crops in real-time, autonomous self-driving and electric tractors, planters that can shoot out over 1,000 seeds per second, and a virtual command center mapping out everything happening across a farmer’s acreage — this is what I mean when I say Deere is much more high-tech than you might first think.

Deere’s See & Spray technology can, as mentioned, recognize weeds or diseased crops on a second-to-second basis and then spray the perfect portion of herbicide to kill the unwanted flora, reducing the amount of herbicide farmers use by as much as two-thirds.

Deere’s equipment has thousands of sensors that work together to form a digital map of a farm, which can then be used for simulating different scenarios and making recommendations to farmers on the most optimal ways to do things, from the most efficient path to drive their tractors on to the types of crops they should grow or how to respond to weather events.

This [video](https://youtu.be/bqOdLFvhCas?utm_source=intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=john-deere-an-american-stalwart&_bhlid=d349f294cdf8f55e1e6a5deecae9460baf8670c8) is a great illustration of Deere’s tech at work.

From a business perspective, Deere’s machinery pays for itself by saving farmers on costs elsewhere (fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, time, etc.). So, farmers need to upgrade their equipment every few years to stay up-to-date on the latest efficiency-enhancing technology since cost is the primary thing they compete on in commodity production.

But all of these software offerings fundamentally change Deere’s business model from machine sales & maintenance to recurring subscription revenues, data packages, and high-tech equipment add-ons.

([See breakdown of costs for farmers](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFVkn-YDKsnrQJjbhGs9ri44KKDjPKAFurg9XA61Ad-hkKE-Rdko3byvBDxtOk9mFlMEd31eUtXClqi5tkgrrBd9QEKOZqsCESr-sq-KW1Pim5p9vBY8D3QVksn8exqm_nDtJEvQ?key=45tN344jTHGjcrDsjQqfSYpl).)

While Deere’s business has always been cyclical, as farmers collectively delay major purchases in ‘bad years’ when poor weather, crop disease, or interest rates make it a less-than-ideal time to \~ pay the price of a new house \~ for an updated piece of equipment, software subscriptions are generating higher-margin and more recurring revenues that nerf some of the undesirable fluctuations in the company’s business.

By 2030, Deere’s management hopes that 40% of its revenues will come from recurring services, including routine parts sales and maintenance, as well as subscriptions.

That maintenance and servicing is a big part of the story: Deere’s competitive advantage lies, in part, in its vast network of dealerships, particularly in the U.S. but also worldwide, which makes it comparatively far more convenient to own a Deere since a dealership is never too far away to assist.

Farmers work on tight margins with compressed periods (tilling, planting, harvesting) to cram their work into, so they cannot afford to have important equipment offline for extended durations. And as tractors and combines have gotten more advanced, the more specialized it has become to service them, making it all the more important to be able to quickly have maintenance done.

**Financial Services?**

([See DE's Revenue breakdown](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1072f852-5ee8-4be1-b087-510b75a89339/image.png?t=1732651825).)

Beyond the promises of a tech-led transition that can materially improve the quality of Deere’s business (in terms of profit margins and recurring-ness/reliability), Deere has long run a financial services division that generates a bit less than 8% of its revenues.

This in-house financing serves solely to drive more equipment sales and, again, is a competitive advantage in a way. Given that we’ve already established a large piece of farm equipment could cost as much as or more than a new house, being able to provide loans directly to farmers hugely streamlines the purchasing process compared with having to get a loan from a local bank.

Since Deere isn’t actually a bank, its Financial Services division has to effectively borrow money from others, fortunately at very low interest rates — thanks to Deere & Co’s nearly pristine credit rating — and then lends out those funds to customers to finance equipment purchases at higher interest rates, capturing the spread between what rates they borrow and lend at as profit.

This has the added benefit of making the purchasing process easier for customers and also boosting cash conversion, as Deere Financial can ensure that the loan proceeds are used to pay Deere’s manufacturing team upfront.

In other words, Deere Financial ensures the manufacturing team is paid when products are delivered, while customers repay Deere Financial over time with interest

Having the company take on this leverage and credit risk head-on is certainly a risk, but it’s important to remember that Deere probably knows its customers better than anyone after having served farmers for almost two centuries and now collecting a vast amount of data on their operations.

Relatedly, Deere Financial is lending against the company’s own equipment as collateral. They know exactly how much a used machine is worth and that is backstopping their loans.

When you look at Deere’s balance sheet, it appears to have an inordinate amount of debt (\~$60 billion), but most of this is tied to the financial division, so Deere’s operations have a much more conservative financial position (\~$5-6 billion in net debt.)

Deere has an excellent track record in disciplined lending and has managed to do so profitably throughout the business cycle, so this isn’t a major concern for me, but any investor in the company should get comfortable with this dynamic and understand how its financial services division affects the overall business.

**Valuation**

So, where does that leave us? There’s a lot to like about Deere’s resilience, customer loyalty, brand power, and industry-leading positions in both market share and technology. Of course, we want to know how that all translates into value for shareholders who own the business.

I will say upfront that Deere is by no means an easy company to create a simple valuation for. Considering its cyclical sales, R&D spending on new technology, and financing division can all be real complicating factors.

Since Deere remains an inherently cyclical business tied to capex spending cycles for machinery, I used a framework from Aswath Damodaran — a globally revered professor of finance at NYU — for valuing cyclical companies to guide me.

In short, he advises looking at a company’s average operating margins over the last decade, which are easy to find and calculate using a service like [Finchat.io](http://Finchat.io), as shown [here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6137d31a-4a97-4a74-a97f-053cec2c867c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.21.43_PM.png?t=1732641710).

Instead of trying to guess where we are in the sales cycle for a company like Deere, you can multiply this average profit margin by whatever the company’s revenues are over the past year to get a ‘normalized’ estimate of operating profits.

With an estimate for the profits Deere’s operations can generate in a normal year, using a few variables, you can then guesstimate the present value of all of Deere’s future operating profits. The formula is a little messy, but you can view it [here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8cf0d320-0db9-423c-a671-c065b178067f/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.28.52_PM.png?t=1732642137).

The growth rate (or “g”) is the rate at which the company can grow long-term, and for the sake of conservatism, I put this in line with inflation at 2% to assume no real growth. And then, as mentioned, I just pulled the company’s historic returns on capital, tax rates, and cost of capital according to Finchat and plugged them in.

That gives a present value of the company’s lifetime operations, and then you just make some adjustments to that number by adding in cash (an asset), subtracting out debt (a liability), and dividing by the number of shares outstanding to get a target share price.

[Here](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6af59533-dbe9-4661-8654-e933c54078cd/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.33.43_PM.png?t=1732642427) you’ll see the numbers I used and the value per share I got on the right.

That obviously suggests that the stock is priced too expensively today at over $450 per share, but this oversimplified model doesn’t reflect that technology and software subscriptions are structurally improving Deere’s profitability, so averaging their results over the last decade may not be the best indicator of their normalized future profit margins.

As a result, I crunched the numbers again using a revised operating margin of 20% based on what management has said they expect to average going forward, and that naturally gave a higher valuation but still suggested the stock was trading at a premium.

(See [screenshot](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/82891d87-0af3-413a-8c61-ec9b7ca06598/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.37.22_PM.png?t=1732642645) from my model).

To be even more aggressive, we could not only use management’s target average margins but also account for the fact that 2024 was a downcycle year, where revenue was only 80% of what management thinks they can earn ""mid-cycle.” So, by normalizing both revenues and margins, I can get a valuation that says the stock is slightly undervalued, but it’s a stretch:

For the record, I don’t do these exercises to generate strict price targets. Even simple models like this are fraught with assumptions. For example, slight changes to the cost of capital (aka “WACC”) can dramatically change a company’s estimated valuation, and as I’ve shown, changing the company’s average operating margin to 20% from 14% can add over $100 of estimated value per share, and there’s no simple answer for which one will be more representative of reality in the future.

[Charlie and Warren don’t exactly think highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bxyGipl8lo&utm_source=intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=john-deere-an-american-stalwart&_bhlid=cccab1fd174b17d7d6bd557edb597ab856bb254d) of relying on cost of capital calculations as discount rates, either.

As such, take that all with a grain of salt, but you’re welcome to play around with my model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NgD4RiuKZXJjdilgiJNB10HQ55OkHCTk) for illustrative purposes.

More tangibly, I like to look at the free cash flows companies can produce (this is effectively what is left over after accounting for operating expenses, reinvestments, and removing the effects of non-cash accounting adjustments.)

Free cash flows are what drive returns for stock investors implicitly or directly through dividends & share buybacks, and so the free cash flow yield (the amount of free cash flow per share relative to the price of the stock) is an important metric to look at in understanding a company’s valuation.

Deere’s free cash flow yield is around 3.6%, but if you believe management’s guidance that 2024 was a below-average year where the company earned about 80% of what it can on average over time, then the company’s ‘normalized’ FCF yield is 4.5% (3.6%/0.8).

As such, assuming Deere didn’t grow at all and its valuation multiple didn’t expand or contract, we would expect to earn an average of 4.5% per year over the next 5-10 years — derived directly from that FCF yield.

Of course, Deere will continue to grow its sales and earnings (net income grew at 15.5% per year over the last decade), and that will only enhance expected returns. If Deere can grow free cash flows by 5.5% per year going forward, adding that to the existing FCF yield already implies a 10% annual return.

And, if you really believe in Deere’s technology and ability to earn more recurring revenues, then that quality would very likely be rewarded by the market in the coming years with a higher average price-to-earnings ratio that would further boost returns beyond 10% per year.

**Portfolio Decision**

That all sounds pretty good, so why am I deciding not to add Deere to my portfolio? Deere falls into my too-hard pile.

Merit points aren’t given for working harder at finding decent investments. Hard work can certainly help you uncover opportunities, but hard work for the sake of working hard isn’t always productive, and I prefer not to make investing any harder than it already is.

That insight isn’t unique as many great investors follow the idea of having a too-hard pile, where they just can’t fully wrap their head around an investment for some reason, so instead, they just move on to the next. There are thousands and thousands of companies globally to invest in — I’m not anywhere close to having to worry about running out of options.

There are all sorts of accounting considerations for treating Deere more like a tech company, such as capitalizing spending on R&D as assets on the balance sheet rather than expensing them immediately, and the financial services division introduces a whole lot of leverage and different risk dynamics that I’m not too comfortable with, either, on top of the fact that Deere is still a cyclical company, meaning its results do not come in a straight line, up and to the right, that’s easy to value.

I grew up in the suburbs, and even though I’d heard of John Deere, something about it is less intuitive to me than Ulta, which I added to the portfolio last week. I’ve been inside Ulta stores dozens of times, I know plenty of women who love Ulta’s beauty products, and they operate a relatively straightforward retail business that doesn’t rely on technology in nearly the same way as Deere, so I feel much more comfortable thinking through the thesis with Ulta.

With Deere, I worry there’s an element of “not knowing what ya don’t know,” and there’s a lot I don’t know about agriculture. That said, I do find the company compelling, and maybe one day I will feel as though I understand Deere well enough. I wouldn't be surprised if the company earned 10%, 15%, or 20% returns per year if they really deliver some of the innovations they’ve hinted at.

But for now, I’m happy with concluding that Deere is approximately fairly valued and moving on because I’d rather miss out than get burned by a business I don’t understand.

That obviously suggests that the stock is priced too expensively today at over $450 per share, but this oversimplified model doesn’t reflect that technology and software subscriptions are structurally improving Deere’s profitability, so averaging their results over the last decade may not be the best indicator of their normalized future profit margins.

As a result, I crunched the numbers again using a revised operating margin of 20% based on what management has said they expect to average going forward, and that naturally gave a higher valuation but still suggested the stock was trading at a premium.

(See [screenshot](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/82891d87-0af3-413a-8c61-ec9b7ca06598/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_12.37.22_PM.png?t=1732642645) from my model).

To be even more aggressive, we could not only use management’s target average margins but also account for the fact that 2024 was a downcycle year, where revenue was only 80% of what management thinks they can earn ""mid-cycle.” So, by normalizing both revenues and margins, I can get a valuation that says the stock is slightly undervalued, but it’s a stretch:

For the record, I don’t do these exercises to generate strict price targets. Even simple models like this are fraught with assumptions. For example, slight changes to the cost of capital (aka “WACC”) can dramatically change a company’s estimated valuation, and as I’ve shown, changing the company’s average operating margin to 20% from 14% can add over $100 of estimated value per share, and there’s no simple answer for which one will be more representative of reality in the future.

[Charlie and Warren don’t exactly think highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bxyGipl8lo&utm_source=intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=john-deere-an-american-stalwart&_bhlid=cccab1fd174b17d7d6bd557edb597ab856bb254d) of relying on cost of capital calculations as discount rates, either.

As such, take that all with a grain of salt, but you’re welcome to play around with my model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NgD4RiuKZXJjdilgiJNB10HQ55OkHCTk) for illustrative purposes.

More tangibly, I like to look at the free cash flows companies can produce (this is effectively what is left over after accounting for operating expenses, reinvestments, and removing the effects of non-cash accounting adjustments.)

Free cash flows are what drive returns for stock investors implicitly or directly through dividends & share buybacks, and so the free cash flow yield (the amount of free cash flow per share relative to the price of the stock) is an important metric to look at in understanding a company’s valuation.

Deere’s free cash flow yield is around 3.6%, but if you believe management’s guidance that 2024 was a below-average year where the company earned about 80% of what it can on average over time, then the company’s ‘normalized’ FCF yield is 4.5% (3.6%/0.8).

As such, assuming Deere didn’t grow at all and its valuation multiple didn’t expand or contract, we would expect to earn an average of 4.5% per year over the next 5-10 years — derived directly from that FCF yield.

Of course, Deere will continue to grow its sales and earnings (net income grew at 15.5% per year over the last decade), and that will only enhance expected returns. If Deere can grow free cash flows by 5.5% per year going forward, adding that to the existing FCF yield already implies a 10% annual return.

And, if you really believe in Deere’s technology and ability to earn more recurring revenues, then that quality would very likely be rewarded by the market in the coming years with a higher average price-to-earnings ratio that would further boost returns beyond 10% per year.

**Portfolio Decision**

That all sounds pretty good, so why am I deciding not to add Deere to my portfolio? Deere falls into my too-hard pile.

Merit points aren’t given for working harder at finding decent investments. Hard work can certainly help you uncover opportunities, but hard work for the sake of working hard isn’t always productive, and I prefer not to make investing any harder than it already is.

That insight isn’t unique as many great investors follow the idea of having a too-hard pile, where they just can’t fully wrap their head around an investment for some reason, so instead, they just move on to the next. There are thousands and thousands of companies globally to invest in — I’m not anywhere close to having to worry about running out of options.

There are all sorts of accounting considerations for treating Deere more like a tech company, such as capitalizing spending on R&D as assets on the balance sheet rather than expensing them immediately, and the financial services division introduces a whole lot of leverage and different risk dynamics that I’m not too comfortable with, either, on top of the fact that Deere is still a cyclical company, meaning its results do not come in a straight line, up and to the right, that’s easy to value.

I grew up in the suburbs, and even though I’d heard of John Deere, something about it is less intuitive to me than Ulta, which I added to the portfolio last week. I’ve been inside Ulta stores dozens of times, I know plenty of women who love Ulta’s beauty products, and they operate a relatively straightforward retail business that doesn’t rely on technology in nearly the same way as Deere, so I feel much more comfortable thinking through the thesis with Ulta.

With Deere, I worry there’s an element of “not knowing what ya don’t know,” and there’s a lot I don’t know about agriculture. That said, I do find the company compelling, and maybe one day I will feel as though I understand Deere well enough. I wouldn't be surprised if the company earned 10%, 15%, or 20% returns per year if they really deliver some of the innovations they’ve hinted at.

But for now, I’m happy with concluding that Deere is approximately fairly valued and moving on because I’d rather miss out than get burned by a business I don’t understand.

**Why am I posting this then?** For starters, I want to normalize posting research on companies even if we don't invest in them. Maybe some of you all can help me get smarter about DE and tell me what I'm missing.

1hkt4cu_DE,DE,De Le Rue (LSE:DLAR) - Divesture offers attractive entry opportunity to prestigious currency manufacturer,"Another UK business investment opportunity here, unlocked by the sale of a business division, and offering a median 16% margin of safety for day 1 post divesture valuation, given the £1.05 price at the time of writing.

De La Rue is a well known name within currency printing. At one point it was responsible for a third of the worlds total currency printing. The business operates through an Authentication division, providing digital software solutions and security labels, and a Currency division, offering the design and manufacturing of banknotes.

Over the last 10 years several factors have led to a large decline in the business' share price. Prior mismanagement had led to several court cases, missed payments from customers (including Venezuela Central Bank defaulted on an £18m payment in 2019), and large contract losses (most importantly a £490m contact to print the UK's blue passports in 2019). The business is currently struggling with a legacy Defined Benefit Pension deficit and a large and expensive revolving credit facility.

Led by renowned activist fund Crystal Amber, De La Rue changed leadership and has recently agreed to sell its Authentication division to Crane NXT for £300m. A great success given the EV of the total group is only £342m, Revenue is split 64% Currency 36% Authentication, and adjusted Operating Profit is split 30% Currency 70% Authentication.

The sale will leave management debt-free, pension-deficit-free, and with a healthy high-double-digit-million net cash balance (c£70m at my most conservative estimation) which should enable them to take advantage of a much increased order book showing signs of double-digit EBITDA growth in FY26. The business has also taken steps to become leaner and the removal of several costs, such as bank loan interest and the £2m cost of the Gateshead facility, should help margins.

Valuation is difficult as the business doesn't report enough information on the separate divisions to provide forecasts without large assumptions. Estimations from Crystal Amber place the business at £1.49 per share, a recent offer for 40% of the Currency division from PE puts the business at £1.25 per share, and my most conservative estimation puts the business at £1.20 per share.

1ha6boj_DE,DE,Why BioLargo (the company behind POOPh) Represents a De-Risked Multi-Bagger Investment Opportunity at a $60 Million Market Cap,"**ANALYSIS of a $100M POOPH Exit Check - BLGO a De-risked Opportunity**

BioLargo is an innovation engine dedicated to creating a better tomorrow by inventing, developing, and commercializing Cleantech innovations aimed at ""Making Life Better.""

***In my humble opinion, investing in BioLargo is one of the most purposeful ways to utilize our capital, as it addresses significant global environmental and wound care challenges while presenting a unique investment opportunity.***

**The POOPH Pet Odor Eliminator** is a standout product in the pet care industry. Developed using BioLargo's ONM ENVIRONMENTAL Cupridyne Clean Tech, POOPH utilizes a technology that is already in use by the top five waste-handling companies in the United States.

**Key Highlights of POOPH:**

\- Breaking all sales records

\- Demonstrating the efficacy of BioLargo’s technology

\- Validating the business model

\- Garnering attention and recognition

\- Exhibiting hockey-stick revenue growth

\- Leading towards profitability

\- Potentially resulting in a substantial cash infusion

The ultimate goal is to rapidly grow the POOPH brand and subsequently sell it to a major corporation like Procter & Gamble. The anticipated sale price is projected to be at least $500 million, with BioLargo poised to receive a significant cash infusion exceeding $100 million from this transaction due to its negotiated 20% stake in the exit.

**Financial Analysis Based on the 2023 10-K Report:**

The report outlines the following key expenses, excluding the cost of goods sold (COGS) associated with the ONM Environmental segment, which is expected to be eliminated upon the sale of the POOPH brand:

**Expenses:**

\- COGS (excluding ONM): $395,000

\- Selling, General & Administrative: $8,058,000

\- Research & Development: $2,282,000

\- Impairment Expense: $394,000

\- Interest Expense: $91,000

**Total Expenses (excluding ONM COGS):** $11,220,000

This figure reflects the total operating expenses necessary to sustain the BioLargo business in 2023, excluding $5,681,000 in COGS specifically attributed to the ONM Environmental segment. An additional estimate of $1 million for non-POOPH ONM COGS brings total annual expenses to approximately $13 million.

In this context, a hypothetical $100 million cash infusion, potentially from the sale of the POOPH brand, could support the company's operations for nearly a decade. This is particularly significant given that POOPH revenue constituted only 76% of BioLargo's total revenue in Q3, indicating the emergence of other revenue streams.

The CEO and the management team are optimistic about larger revenue streams projected for 2025 and beyond. The success of POOPH serves as a proven business model and a safety net for the company. The targeted expansion of the POOPH brand from 35,000 to 80,000 retail locations, coupled with new product launches and marketing initiatives, could drive profitability and lead to substantial cash inflows through sales or strategic transactions.

With a current market cap of $60 million, any additional successes similar to POOPH could significantly boost the company's valuation. Patience is essential, and it is anticipated to be rewarded as the company continues to effectively execute its strategic initiatives.

A cash infusion exceeding $100 million would not only expedite the commercialization of other ventures but also enable the recruitment of valuable team members and enhance marketing efforts for both the technology and the company, effectively reducing risk to nearly zero.

**Future Potential:**

**The company projects that the minimum future value of three of its subsidiaries could exceed $1 billion each**, similar to promising independent Medical or Clean Tech companies. These include:

1. **Clyra Medical Technologies:** Developing the innovative copper-iodine wound irrigation solution, Bioclynse, which is FDA 510(k) cleared and ready for a national rollout with a potential major partner. Notable advantages include non-cytotoxic, non-sensitizing properties, and effectiveness against biofilms. The CEO has stated, ""There's a gap in that market, and we're going to fill it,"" with expectations that it could be 5 to 10 times larger than POOPH.
2. **BEST (BioLargo Equipment Solutions & Technologies):** Pioneering the Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) technology capable of removing over 99% of PFAS chemicals from water, addressing a $17 trillion global issue. This technology is already under a commercial contract and in collaboration with the EPA.
3. **BioLargo Energy Technologies:** Advancing the novel liquid sodium-based battery technology, Cellinity, designed for long-duration energy storage. Confirmed stability, reliability, and efficiency make Cellinity well-positioned to contribute to the global energy transition.

**Biolargo is well worth a deeper look- Conduct your own due diligence.**",2024-12-09,8,17

1d9vib4_DE,DE,Analysis determining the undervalued pound using micheal (de-gen) burry strategy ,"This trade I've been interested in a while now following Micheal burry finding undervalued stocks I've been analysing if GBP is undervalued now using the term history repeats I reckons we are on set to repeat the 93 election.
 
 
Micheal burry an extremely good trader his strategy is a rather simple once you get through all the complicated economics maths and data. Simply to put it he finds undervalued securities then does research if there's a catalyst then he can make a trade from there. However finding this undervalued ness is not as easy as picking a random security and hoping for the best (gambling)
 
Now on to my point the GBP is undervalued at the moment how well the main points to looking at a undervalued currency is due to economic challenges like high inflation, political instability, trade deficits, or lack of investor confidence. Know to conduct analysis. Luckily I have the internet meaning I have all the data I want at a fingertip. Looking at data posted by UK gov we are still above are monetary rates for inflation by currently according to the data. However we are apparently falling towards this goal of 2% but how confident are we on that. This is the question I will solve, when developing a trade like this you have to answer every question you make by using data. At the moment I would say that retail trading and public confidence is not high using data gathered from sources of the back end of the extremely high inflation rates of 2022. now paired with the coming up election could act as a catalyst more about this in a minute, first to further back up my point, political instability the UK well, put simply is about as unstable politically as a racist marrying a black women, from the last serving government (conservatives) we can see a unravelling of instability, whether it was Brexit aka the least smooth exit since the creation of time, or Liz truss lasting shorter than an iceberg Lettice and somehow bumming the GBP into oblivion she did this as Determined to quickly make her mark, Truss announced a radical new economic agenda of tax cuts and spending worth tens of billions of pounds funded by borrowing – the true total of which is still not known. The move, which appeared to also violate public spending curbs, tore apart the orthodoxy established by the three Conservative prime ministers who went before her during 12 years in power that tried to emphasise fiscal prudence.
Truss’s drive for growth proved too radical for traders. The pound was sent spiralling to reach its lowest value against the US dollar, an embarrassing intervention from the central bank – the Bank of England – was made to avoid a raid on pension funds, and rebukes from foreign observers, including the International Monetary Fund (thanks telegraph for letting me plagiarise a little bit). This is just one political and economic instability. Uk trade deficit well put simply fucked but as a wannabe quant I've studied the data and currently the UK has a trade deficit of 109billion just with the EU enough said I'm writing this at 12 I'm tired.
 
Now to finish off we need a catalyst and currently I think we have the best catalyst the upcoming election to prove my catalyst we were in this situation in 1993 where after the election we saw massive growth in the GBP and we have something coming, so learn from the past.

1b32jcg_DE,DE,Am I missing something with Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG.DE),"Me as an ""investor"": I don't trust the american market any more, I invest in individual companies, I like dividends, I buy to hold long term (normally 1-2 trades a year).

So I recently stumpled upon Mercedes-Benz Group (they do high end cars and lorries) They currently trade at a P/E of under 6, have turned a profit for at least the last 3 years, do a dividend payout at around 7% (5.30€), and the only negative thing I can find about them is that they have a fairly high debt, which they have reduced the last 3 years at least.

What am I missing? I took a look at them a few days ago and ended up buying a batch, but it keeps nagging me. Am I missing something and are there other parameters that I should be looking at?",2024-02-29,8,16

1aw2suk_DE,DE,Apontis Pharma (APPH.DE),"For anyone interested in pharma, looking for one that is disgustingly undervalued, look at Apontis Pharma (APPH). I think one of the favourite stocks in my portfolio, because no one knows about it and they have a lot of potential. They are a German company who manufactures single pill solutions for people with heart problems, who have to take many different medications. By combining them into single pill they are then able to charge higher prices, because it saves money to patients and insurance companies at the end of the day, and their solution is more effective than taking multiple pills at the same time. Also, they on track to release 20 new pills between 2023 and 2028 (can't remember the exact date of top of my head so might want to check it). It is important to note that they had a string of bad luck in the past year as they have battled with the departure of their CEO and loss of a key partnership, however their fundamentals remain strong and im extremely bullish on the company.

18n4mji_DE,DE,$DE vs $CAT right now,"Two really well performing stocks, and currently both sitting at what I believe is good value for the future growth prospects of the company. I live in the UK with access to a tax free investment account (SSISA), so I'll be focusing on the DRIP returns as well.   


Firstly $DE:

* P/E Ratio of 11.4
* Latest dividend at 1.38% ($1.47)
* Price of \~390 at time of writing
* 466% DRIP return since this time 10 years ago (18.75% annualised)
* Estimated YoC in 2033 (digrin DGR10) is 3%
* Current TipRanks score of 9, with a Moderate Buy Rating
* Average price target \~423 (8.58% upside not including dividends
* DE is currently entering a reduced earnings cycle, but I believe this just presents a buying opportunity for a great company at a good price. I expect the stock to underperform the market in 2024, but I expect to see a pretty good outperformance in the next 10 years.

&#x200B;

Secondly $CAT:

* P/E Ratio of 16.6
* Latest dividend at 1.75% ($5.1)
* Price is \~290 at time of writing (wish I had bought this in the early November at \~230 but hindsight is 2020)
* 365% DRIP return since this time 10 years ago (16.46% annualised)
* Estimated YoC in 2033 (digrin DGR10) is 4.3%
* Current TipRanks score of 10, with a Moderate Buy Rating
* Average price target of \~278 (4.38% downside not including dividends)
* CAT is in a strong position where reduced inflation in it's major markets could contribute to a boom in building which has been largely held back since COVID. Lots of backlog means great earning are expected. My only worry is the current price spike to \~290 exceeded a lot of expectations, and a market correction may cause some short-term downside on the stock. 

&#x200B;

Personally I believe both of these stocks have a really strong foundation to position themselves as market-beating stocks that provide both a solid growth and solid dividend growth. My personal choice is a Buy on DE, I will not be opening a position in CAT as of now. Maybe if a correction occurs in February I will consider adding CAT to my portfolio, but for now I believe DE is the better stock to open a position in.

What would 'de-globalization' look like? What's driving this trend? Is this trend really about 'de-globalization', or is it just about de-coupling from China & Russia? Arguably, China & Russia have been big beneficiaries of globalization, especially China which has made itself the world's factory. If the new 'de-globalization' trend is really about de-coupling from China & Russia, then they would be expected to lose from it.

We're hearing newer words beyond 'near-shoring' -- words or phrases like 'friend-shoring', etc. How can such criteria be quantified? Earnings reports and forecasts can show objective criteria like earnings, revenues, profitability, etc. But how do companies, industries, national economies demonstrate 'friendliness'? Is this a purely political and subjective term? Can it be used to influence investors? Or will the 'friend-shoring' trend be a purely regulatory effect, driven by regulations?

There have been metrics and standards created for ESG (Environmental Social Governance), and so can we expect new metrics and standards to be created for 'friendliness'? Who gets to create and set these metrics and standards? Will this be done apolitically, or will it be an entirely political exercise?

Will there be universal buy-in, adherence and compliance? If not, then how can we expect this trend to progress or succeed? Or will this trend just fizzle out?",2022-09-10,34,63

Hey bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! Earnings week is slowly winding down, meaning we’ve got less opportunities to make plays. I believe this will be the last week of the historical post earnings move spreadsheet for the quarter, as next week barely has any companies reporting. I would like to thank you all for checking in with me all throughout the quarter and giving your opinions on my plays! I hope you all managed to make some good money by tagging along. I’ll see you all in two months! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1memzXUXLqNBD0jy43ImdIiF5joZ7M9NSY6d8ZiCYXIc/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **$DLTR and $DG provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** $DLTR reports earnings this week, while $DG is set to report next. If I’m bullish or bearish on either company, I should look to enter a $DG position BEFORE $DLTR reports since the $DLTR report will move $DG a comparable amount. By playing $DG we can avoid IV crush but still cash in on our gains if we’re correct. More info on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$PDD is inefficiently priced.** You guys already know the drill. At the time of writing, $PDD is priced to move around 10%. Historically $PDD moves 14%. Similar to $FL last week, $PDD reports on Friday, meaning that theta will murder the value of the options, allowing us to get in cheaper than we would normally be able to. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate, the options will be pricing a move closer to 8% come Friday, meaning we’ve got huge edge in this trade. If the numbers are still appealing come Wednesday afternoon (markets are closed Thursday), I will run a long straddle. More information on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

I believe this is what is leading to it being undervalued - The difficulty to understand the company makes it very difficult to fairly value it.

Keep in mind the projects I talk about within the post are probably 2/3rds of IRRs licenses they have access to. They also have some iron and bauxite licenses and further gold assets. These are just currently the most interesting and likely to be further developed IMO.

**IronRidge Resources Profile:**

IRR is a resource exploration company mainly with projects in Africa targeting gold and lithium:

\- Founded in 2007.

\- Current share price of £0.18

\- Current market cap of \~£100mn

\- 573mn Outstanding Shares

\- **Net cash position of $US 28mn. (£20.5mn)**

\- **No debt**

\- Holds 28 licenses not including assets within Australia and Gabon which are not part of the focus. I will be focussing on the most exciting prospects which are:

\- The Zaranou Gold Project within the Ivory Coast.

\-The Vavoua Gold Project within the Ivory Coast.

\- The Dorothe Gold Project within Chad.

\- The Ewoyaa Lithium Project and the Egyasimanku Lithium Project which make up the Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio within Ghana.

\- The Un-Developed Lithium Project within the Ivory Coast.

**Gold Projects Owned by IRR:**

Ivory Coast - Zaranou Gold Project:

* Pre-resource stage project based in the east of the Ivory Coast.
* Contains 8 currently identified target zones. Each ranging from 2 - 7km in strike along a 47km trend.
* Currently focussed on 3 zones: Greater Ehuasso (which includes the Mbasso, Coffee Bean and Ehuasso targets), Yakassé, and Ebilassokro.
* 40,000km out of 50,000km drilling campaign already completed. RC (Reverse Circulation) and AC (Air-core) drilling has been completed.
* Zaranou shows multiple, high grade, stacked veins. 
* High recovery rate of free gold in the weathered/oxide zone.
* Very low cost, moderate grade, bulk tonnage-styles of resource modelling and extraction.
* Continuing developments into the fresh rock could see the resource significantly grow, at the slight expense of higher mining costs, lower gold recoveries and higher sulphide content.

Greater Ehuasso Target (Part of the Zaranou Project):

* Made up of 3 targets along an 8km strike.
* Average width of 1km for each target.
* Mineralisation focussed into multiple zones of 20 - 50m.
* Grades can be characterised as: High grade zones, forming along steep dipping ‘veins’.
* ...with the moderate to low grade zones forming a disseminated halo envelope around the veins.
* Discoveries made:

Over the Ehuasso and Greater Ehuasso target volumetric analysis has been completed:

* Grades ranged from 0.9 to 2.5 g/t Au
* **Multiple deposits ranging from 200k to 1Moz ($350mn to $1.75bn at a Gold value of $1750/Oz)**
* Cut-off grades from similar projects ranges between 0.3-0.8 g/t
* Volumetric analysis is based on highly speculative estimates, and though validation estimates were used to calibrate the calculations, there are multiple highly variable factors that could affect this estimation.

What can be defined from the projected Ehausso resource:

* Could hold a considerable quantity of moderate grade, large tonnage and high recoverable gold.
* **At a low AISC (All in sustaining cost) estimated at $800/Oz. Would indicate a profit of around $950 per Oz. Therefore giving a range of profit of $190mn to $900mn using the deposit range of 200k to 1Moz.**
* Strong possibility of depth extensions with further RC holes indicating grade continues down to around 200m.
* Though AISC may increase with extension of resource, extension could see estimated addition of 50%-75% of contained gold.

Ivory Coast - Vavoua Gold Project:

* Along strike from established and growing 2.15Moz Abujar Project (3rd party, JORC compliant)

\- 200km2 license area.

\- Extensive artisanal workings within the area.

\- First mover advantage.

**IRR Lithium Projects (The Exciting Bit):**

IRR's Ghana Lithium Project:

IRR's Ghanaian lithium projects (Ewoyaa and another less developed project) are grouped under the name ""Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio"" due to their proximity to Cape Coast. The cape coast lithium project has a licensed area of 684km2.

This is the current stage of the Ewoyaa project:

* Lithium deposits are near surface and contain coarse grained, high purity lithium spodumene.
* Maiden resource estimate of 14.5Mt @ 1.31% Li2O completed in 2020.
* Post-tax **NPV of US$345m** (The net present value of the Ewoyaa project after tax, NPV seeks to capture the total value of a potential investment opportunity)
* **The Net Present Value of Ewoyaa was calculated using Spodumene values of around $650/tonne. Current value of Spodumene is $1350/tonne. This should theoretically have increased the NPV of the Ewoyaa project to \~$716mn.**
* 8 Year expected mine life for a capital cost of $68mn.
* **8 Year total revenue expected at $1.55bn.**
* Low-impurity allows for simple gravitational separation to achieve premium grades of Spodumene (SC6)
* Only 110km from deep sea-port Takoradi will allow IRR to be one of the lowest $/t transport cost spodumene concentrate producers.
* **Transport costs estimated at $15.8/tonne, making this project the cheapest lithium project on the planet.**
* Ongoing drilling is expected to grow the resource consid.erably, with an estimated addition of US$40m to the NPV with every additional year of production. Further discoveries made on the 2nd September 2021.
* Ore has been defined into two groups P1 and P2.
* P1 rated ore is coarse grained with recoveries of 74%.
* P2 rated ore is fine grained with a recovery rate of 51% to produce a 5.5% blending concentrate.

**Involvement of Piedmont Lithium** into the Ghanian lithium project:

Piedmont Lithium aims to become the lowest cost producers of Lithium Hydroxide in the world. They have a market cap of $1.3bn.

* Piedmont Lithium **agreed to ‘fully fund and fast track development’ of the Ewoyaa Project at a cost of $102mn on the 1st of July 2021.**
* Deal completed on the 31st of August 2021 and split into 3 stages.

Stage One:

* Piedmont subscribed for 54mn ordinary shares at a **price of £0.20** with a **12 month lock in period**. (Announced on 1st of July)
* Piedmont subscribed for a **further 2.88mn shares at a price of £0.25**. (Announced on 31st of August)
* **Total investment into IRR shares of $15mn**.

Stage Two:

* Piedmont commit $5mn towards regional exploration to further expand the Ewoyaa resource.
* Piedmont commit $12mn towards completing definitive feasibility studies (DFS) for the project.
* **Minimum DFS criteria is to produce 1.5 - 2 million tonnes per annum run of mine operation for 8-10 year life of mine.**
* Any overrun costs or savings will be shared equally by IRR and Piedmont.
* If DFS criteria is fulfilled and Piedmont choose not to proceed with Stage 3, Piedmont will forfeit it’s stage 2 interest.
* **Piedmont to receive 22.5% ownership of IRR’s Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio including Ewoyaa via this funding.**

Stage 3:

* Piedmont to **commit $70mn Capex for the Ewoyaa project.**
* To deliver a 1.5 - 2 million tonnes per annum run of mine operation for 8-10 years.
* **Piedmont to receive 27.5% Ownership of IRR’s Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio including Ewoyaa via this funding.**

Piedmont Entitlements:

* Ability to appoint one director to the board of IRR as long as they keep their interest in IRR above 9%.
* **Offtake agreement for 50% of IRR’s annual Lithium Spodumene Concentrate Production.** Offtake pricing to be determined via formula which accounts for prevailing price of lithium products, ensuring IRR capture value add in margins.

IRR's Cote d' Ivoire Lithium Project:

IRR also holds licenses to lithium projects within the Ivory Coast:

* IRR also owns 1172km2 of currently undeveloped lithium licenses within the Ivory Coast.
* This is made up of three separate projects called Rubino, Agboville and Adzope.
* Once the gold portfolio is demerged from the company these lithium licenses could be next to be develop significantly.

**Gold Portfolio De-Merger:**

Intentions:

On the 1st of June 2021 IRR announced their intention to de-merge ALL of their gold assets from the company:

\- Reasoning - IRR ""concluded that the Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio is materially undervalued in IronRidge's current structure and requires a distinct, separate focus to release its true value.""

\- ""Allows IronRidge to focus all its resources on its three-stage ramp-up to production strategy at Ewoyaa, following a very strong increase in interest in the project.""

Proposed Terms: 

The proposed terms for the de-merger were released on October 26th and are as follows.

\- Gold assets to be transferred to a new company called Ricca Resources.

\- Ironridge Resources will hold just its lithium assets, and will be renamed Atlantic Lithium.

\- Ricca will be valued at cash only, and will take $7mn from IRR to fund the gold project. Leaving Atlantic Lithium with a cash position of $22mn.

**- Ironridge holders on the ex-dividend date will receive one Ricca share for every 8 Ironridge Resources share.**

\- Ricca will begin life as a un-listed company.

\- Once the de-merger is complete, Ricca will complete a priority offering only accessible to Ironridge holders for $7.1mn at $0.1AUD. This will leave Ricca with a cash position of $14.1mn.

\- Ricca will aim to list on a recognised exchange in time after. (After Christmas at least hinted by CEO.)

**- CEO stated if the exchange were to be the ASX (The home market of the company as it is incorporated within Australia.) the minimum listing price for a company is $0.2AUD. Therefore, this would guarantee a 4x gain on Ricca shares for shareholders who participate in the priority offer.**

\- As the gold company is currently just being valued at cash position, if Ricca Resources completed feasibility studies on their gold assets before coming to market this 4x gain could be even greater.

Discussion:

At first the terms of the de-merger seem to screw over shareholders due to valuing the gold company at cash, and not giving shareholders the value of the gold assets. This could have been done by completing valuation studies on the gold assets before the de-merger. 

However, you have to understand that the greater the value of Ricca Resources, the more it would hurt the share price of Ironridge Resources/Atlantic Lithium once the assets leave the company.

Therefore, I actually think Vince (CEO) has played this de-merger very smartly for shareholders by limiting the affect onto Atlantic/IRR. Shareholders will now receive Ricca Shares (currently at a low value), but will not see a massive drop off of the value of their IRR shares. However, as the gold assets are developed and studies are completed these Ricca Shares will increase in value. 

**Summary:**

I believe IRR is severely undervalued due to the complexity of its asset structure. They have a current market cap of £100mn in which they hold £20.5mn in cash. Therefore the market is currently valuing all of Ironridge's extensive asset list at \~£80mn.

Considering the post tax NPV of the Lithium asset which Piedmont Lithium are investing in is $345mn (£253mn) the current valuation seems absolutely absurd. **AND THAT IS BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO EVEN ADD THE VALUE OF THE GOLD ASSETS!**

However, time will tell and as always this is just my opinion.",2021-11-07,44,28

q6z2o9_DE,DE,John Deere Workers Sure Look Like They’re About to Go on Strike,"John Deere workers are inching precipitously close to a strike after they overwhelmingly voted to reject a new six-year collective bargaining agreement that had been recommended by the union representing them, the United Auto Workers (UAW).

On Sunday, 90 percent of UAW voting members shot down the new agreement, which had been reached between the union and the tractor manufacturing company and had offered modest wage increases and enhanced retirement benefits that would have come at the expense of new hires. According to the Des Moines Register, pro-strike sentiment has been strong on the ground in Iowa, where union members have erected signs reading “REJECT THIS PIECE OF TRASH” and “YOU DESERVE BETTER.” According to a dispatch from Labor Notes, several union members also showed up to local meetings sporting “F*** No” t-shirts, and at least one member took up the microphone to say that the only thing the agreement was good for was “wiping my ass.”

Now, unless an agreement is reached by the new strike deadline imposed by the UAW of 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 13, more than 10,000 Deere workers at nine locals in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas are set to walk off the job in what would amount to the largest private-sector strike since the 40-day walkout staged by UAW workers employed by GM in 2019.

Officials at John Deere have, thus far, signaled a willingness to keep negotiations going, telling the Register in a statement that the company “remains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees’ viewpoints,” and saying that operations “will continue as normal” in the meantime. But according to internal company emails reviewed by Labor Notes, the company also seems to be increasingly looking to hire white-collar workers in an active effort to “cast a broader net to fill critical factory positions in the case of a work stoppage.”

In addition to setting itself up for one of the biggest labor showdowns in recent memory during a year that has already been rife with worker unrest, labor shortages, and strike efforts, John Deere has also recently emerged as a critical battleground for national right-to-repair laws. Because of its refusal to allow farmworkers to repair their own equipment, the company is frequently seen as being at the heart of the struggle against manufacturing repair monopolies and was referenced as such by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during his doomed campaign for the presidency in 2019.

“In rural America today, farmers can’t even repair their own tractors or other equipment because of the greed of companies like John Deere,” Sanders wrote at the time, vowing that if he became president, he would “pass a national right-to-repair law that gives every farmer in America full rights over the machinery they buy.”

Under the administration of President Joe Biden, right-to-repair has seen several modest victories recently, including a sweeping executive order that directed the Federal Trade Commission to draft regulations that limit the ability of companies like Deere to restrict independent repairs of their products.

pu4smv_DE,DE,$ENSC - De-SPACed - Ensysce Biosciences a Multi-bagger Opportunity beyond the Squeeze,"We brought you $CEI when it was around $.50 to $.60/share. Look where it is today.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ok6kky/og\_energy\_play\_cei\_announces\_favorable\_financing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ok6kky/og_energy_play_cei_announces_favorable_financing/) (FYI, we think the downside risks are greater than the upside in $CEI at this time).

We bring you another potential trade that could result in a share price multiplication. Ensysce Biosciences Inc recently went public via SPAC and is now in the process of de-SPACing, meaning converting from the SPAC shareholders to holders of the new company post merger.

Typically, these SPACs are garbage and result in massive share dilution while the insiders cash out on bag holders (See $TMC). During a short window though, there's typically an opportunity for these plays to squeeze as insider shares are locked or while awaiting for the share sale registrations to be approved by the SEC. This one is a little different since insiders are locked in until the stock hits at least $12/share (trades around $4.50 right now). Warrant holders aren't in the money until it hits $10/share with some consulting warrants going a bit less than $7/share. 

The tradeable float right now is very small. Not as small as some are reporting via social media, but small nonetheless. So, is this a short squeeze play? Yes, but not only that. Even if it doesn't squeeze before the S-1 becomes effective, the company priced its warrants very favorably and locked insiders from selling at bargain basement prices so they'll collect a lot of cash and won't need to raise more funds while dilute the stock.

In addition, this is a biotech play which are kind of like lotto tickets. They are pursuing a space (anti opioid/drug addiction therapy) that is very much in need at the moment. They are clinical stage, meaning trials are in progress. Good trial results typically sends biotechs skyrocketing.

Combine the favorable financing, insider lockups and low float and you have a combination that could send this flying over the next few weeks/months.",2021-09-23,44,28

o6qlry_DE,DE,"Intellabridge is introducing De-Fi tech to the average consumer, read more!","(CSE: INTL) (OTC Pink: CRBTF) (FSE: 98AA)

A lot of people don't understand all the hype behind decentralized finance. The term De-Fi is thrown around all of the time and while there is a large group of people who understand and have adopted the technology, an even larger amount of people are totally clueless. Intellabridge wants to establish De-Fi into everyday banking with their Kash service and allow people to take control of their money.

So what is so bad about centralized banking that makes, Kash and De-Fi as a whole so useful. Here are some of the main drawbacks:

* High inflation rates in some countries discourage investment and savings
* Low-interest rates lead to decrease interest in savings due to lower returns
* Slower transaction times due to legacy payment rails
* High transaction costs put in place by traditional banking solutions

All of these issues make everyday banking and long-term investing more difficult. These problems are apparent everywhere with developed countries like the U.S exhibiting low-interest rates and under-developed countries like Venezuela and Nigeria having high inflation rates. This is why Intellabridge believes their Kash solution will thrive in several markets.

Based on their early Alpha they seem to be correct. It experienced very positive reviews and this month they plan to begin their closed-beta to 100,000 waitlisted users. The Alpha and Beta consist of chequing, savings, and investing accounts. They also have implemented a B2B service for corporate use. If all goes well, they plan to have their open Beta later this year and start operating globally. In other upcoming news in Q3 they are releasing digital bank cards and in Q4 they are releasing physical bank cards.

There is no time like right now to get in on Intellabridge and Kash! With their closed beta beginning any day now their price could jump massively. By the end of the year this could look very different from the $1.10 penny stock it is right now.

Just to rehash a little background on MBH Corp; They are a Europe-based conglomerate that acquires several smaller companies with EBITDA ranging from $1Million - $10Million, as opposed to larger acquisitions. These companies often have MASSIVE potential but investors are not likely to invest due to the risk of investing in smaller IPs. MBH acts as a bridge for small companies to big investors by allowing investors to have a stake in these companies via their equity product.

The company announced this morning the purchase of Intercity Taxi, an English taxi service with a fleet of 120 taxis and over 150 drivers. Once again these guys fit into that small company range with annual revenue of around $2M GBP. They have 40 years of experience in the business and have implemented the iCabbi system to allow for ease of ordering.

The funny thing is the company managed to increase revenue, profit and reduce debt substantially in the past three quarters. Before they were paying a 36 cent yearly dividend with a 4 year track record of payment, it was temporarily discontinued to preserve cash on hand for new acquisitions and reduce debt due to economic uncertainty. This led to what I believe to be a panic selloff alongside the market crash as all this did was significantly increase the company's financial strength.

I managed to get in contact with a director and received notice that the stocks dividend should be returning in early 2021, this is a major bull catalyst if its anything like its 36 cent past dividend which is a 18% yield with the stock currently sitting at $2. Also I have noticed massive amounts of insider purchasing of shares which is reaffirming that the dividend will in fact be returning, odds are this dividend could double the current share prices so you could collect the growth and dividend payment.

Another bullish catalyst I have noticed is that their primary subsidiary (fireplaces) have had a record breaking year for installations and sales and google trends for searches of fireplaces can confirm this going into q4. Fireplace sales only peak in the winter so its likely to only significantly show in their most recent earnings report. Their other subsidiaries are doing quite good as well, with the exception of their oil rig part manufacturing subsidiary which only mildly fell below past revenue. I would think this would also see a spike since all the rigs will need to be fixed and maintained again now that they are being used for the first time in a while. In the end their net profit is gonna be pretty close to 17 Million this year pre-subtractions for taxes + debt interest which equate to about only 170k, which is pretty darn good for their 24 million dollar market cap.

Let alone their pretty decent business model that minimizes excessive risk, this company has pretty good long term growth projections. Here is their investor presentation if you would like to read up on more details.

kigzw3_DE,DE,Decisive Dividend (DE.NV) Stock May Be Reintroducing It's Dividend With Up To A 17% yield.,"Currently the stock is trading at a %50 discount since pre-covid levels. The funny thing is the company managed to increase revenue, profit and reduce debt substantially in the past three quarters. Before they were paying a 36 cent yearly dividend with a 4 year track record of payment, it was temporarily discontinued to preserve cash on hand for new acquisitions and reduce debt due to economic uncertainty. This led to what I believe to be a panic selloff alongside the market crash as all this did was significantly increase the company's financial strength.

kdzsji_DE,DE,"Lead underwriter of MindMed (NEO: MMED) (OTCQB: MMEDF) (DE: MMQ) 80m CAD worth of shares, approx 18m shares. What does this news mean for the stock?","Hello, beginner trader coming across my first stock where it seems I actually got in at a good time ... wanted to use this stock as a learning exercise for what to expect during the growth phases of a stock. I know this isn't a ""penny"" stock but it's OTC and I entered when it was a penny stock so hope that works!

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tmx-group-vista-gold-c-140000689.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tmx-group-vista-gold-c-140000689.html)

This news came out today, and I was hoping to get a better understanding of it. I'm going to number my questions to make it easy to respond:

1. Does this mean 18m stocks are given outright at market price, and then for the next 3 years they have the right to purchase another 9m, from the company, if the market price reaches 9 CAD for 5 days, at 4.40 per unit?[And they did something similar to this back in october,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cu-inc-announces-debenture-issue-002600028.html) but for a smaller amount of shares at a different strike price - is this like an appending of the previous deal, or a whole new pool of shares altogether? Is there a way to know how many of these shares have entered the public pool, or is that just not how it works?
2. I'm also trying to understand what impact this may have on the stock. Let's say the market price hits 9 dollars for 5 days, and the underwriter decides to completely liquidate that position. Would that mean they are selling 18m shares to the public, and therefore diluting the market price? Or does that mean they are selling 18m shares back to the company, at the agreed upon strike price? What kind of impact would that have on the public stock price if that's the case?
3. I was also trying to understand like how many shares are outright public. It looks like from the market cap valuation, there are about 350m shares outstanding. If you look in the yahoo finance numbers, it shows 204m or so as ""float,"" I'm assuming this is owned by insiders/institutions? But the total % if you look right below it owned by insiders/institutions is really like 0.29% of shares?
4. One last thing hopefully this post ends up being productive, this company has 3 tickers for 3 separate exchanges. Each of them has their own current trade volume. Are these all separate pools of stock for MindMed? Or if a share is purchased on the canadian exchange, that's one less stock that is available on the US exchange?
5. A bit more general but is this process of underwriters purchasing large pools of stock typical? I'm wondering if this news is something that can influence the market price.

Any resources to help me gain a basic understanding of these concepts would be great, I am definitely all about looking things up myself, but I really had no idea what to even search for to figure this out. Any help is appreciated! Thanks for checking out the post! First time posting here, let me know if I broke any rules!",2020-12-16,6,14

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

&#x200B;

CAMPBELL, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 8, 2019 / KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management technologies, has partnered with Centre de Technologies Avancées BRP-UdeS (CTA), a leading Quebec-based vehicle research organization, to provide its LYRA internal short circuit (ISC) battery testing device. The CTA plans to leverage KULR’s technology to enhance its ongoing research into the safety of electric vehicle battery systems for its tier-1 OEM clients. Due to the confidential nature of this contract, exact terms were not disclosed.

&#x200B;

The LYRA ISC testing device, utilizing proprietary technology exclusively licensed to KULR by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and NASA, creates failures in lithium-ion battery cells in controlled laboratory conditions, uniquely enabling designers and researchers to study methods to reduce failures and design systems to mitigate their consequences.

&#x200B;

The failures triggered by the LYRA ISC replicate cell failure defects in batteries, which can be some of the most common, serious, and difficult cell failures to detect using traditional battery testing methods, presenting risks to a wide variety of commercial and consumer battery applications. The LYRA ISC received the prestigious R&D100 Award in 2016 and was the runner-up NASA Invention of the Year in 2017.

&#x200B;

“We are truly excited to collaborate with the CTA team to advance their electric vehicle research and engineering efforts. We expect our collaboration will provide the CTA with the necessary tools to further designs for their tier-1 partners, while steering them towards better, safer thermal management solutions,” said Michael Mo, Chief Executive Officer of KULR Technology Group. “We’ve made a concerted effort towards making our LYRA ISC devices more widely available, allowing OEMs to better understand the risks associated with their current battery safety systems. As a next step, we are also working towards establishing a comprehensive battery design and testing methodology, which will be based on our robust portfolio of battery safety technologies.”

&#x200B;

“As an established leader in next-generation vehicle research efforts, CTA is pleased to work with the incredible team at KULR to characterize and test our energy storage designs in ways not previously possible,” said Éric Ménard, Electric Programme Manager at CTA. “We look forward to leveraging the LYRA ISC technology to better understand and improve the behaviors of our electric vehicle innovations.”

aq53hc_DE,DE,"Simple, cheap trading bot for crypto? Is Margin.de any good?","Hi.

I'm also looking for some bot for crypto trading. I've done my research, and mostly websites and forums reccomend bots like HaasBot, CryptoTrader, GunBot, CryptoHopper, ProfitTrailer, 3Commas (and some others)... There are 6-10 bot names, that they are repeating. But these are too expensive for me, as I'm rather playing with trading and learning all the stuff.

I don't invest large amount of money, so I'm looking for rather cheap bot. Basically, most of my needs is just **Trailing Stop Loss** and **integrated charts** for coin pairs. And Binance integration with optional Kraken and Bitstamp.

I know there's free Gekko bot ([https://www.coinbureau.com/education/gekko-trading-bot/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbureau.com%2Feducation%2Fgekko-trading-bot%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNGQKHQz9702QH-VT2qBeGDMxH0X0A) | [https://gekko.wizb.it/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgekko.wizb.it%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNFl0KMRXys2jhxNPotV1yPHBVDnWg)), but it seems rather complicated for me to set it up and then coding in order to develop & run some actions. For now, with my current ""no free time"" scheme, Gekko is no-go.

I've came across TT ([https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/resources/labs/tt-crypto/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradingtechnologies.com%2Fresources%2Flabs%2Ftt-crypto%2F&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNHujoSTzdt6lVYiyhP4483vRiq6gw)), but it seems kind of shady for me: no crypto website wrote about it, as far as I've been doing my research. Beside that, TT operate only on GDAX/Coinbase Pro.

So, finally, I've landed on this site - Margin.de: [https://margin.de/features](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmargin.de%2Ffeatures&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AFQjCNEQS48CcSeCmTzO0W17td0AYv81bg) (formelly Leonardo), which seems to have good reputation overall, it's visually nice and it's $89 **lifetime** license, so totally acceptable for me.

Question is - is it any good and trusted?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I'm not expecting to have 1000% ROI in 7 days. Basically I need automation tool rather than complete strategy bot, which will do everything for me. I want to play with exchange, test my strategies, without placing, editing, deleting my orders manually. 

For  now, I'm putting little ""scalping"" orders on Binance, and I'm having  like 4-7% income on BTC pairs. But putting them manually via exchange  website is difficult and frustrating and I want to automate it. Not to  mention, that I have to look over the charts ""by hand"" in order to keep  up with current prices and also Binance/Kraken/Bitstamp don't have  Trailing Stop Losses...

With some little  help/advise from bot (f.e. notifying me about MACD crossovers and/or  crossing long MA with short MA). ",2019-02-13,8,9

Right now, THC is a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S. which is considered to have ""no currently acceptable medical use"". And it is considered similar to Heroine and LSD. As a side note: Dronabinol, and Syndros are THC drugs except they are synthetic and Schedule III drugs in the realm of Steroids and Codeine. 

Here's the interesting thing, GW Pharmaceuticals currently has Sativex (for multiple sclerosis) approved in 29 countries outside of the US and are trying to get it approved by the FDA for use in the US. If the FDA approves Sativex, it could create a major conflict of interest as the Gov't medical experts would agree that naturally occurring THC has medical value.

7bwq8c_DE,DE,Stop-Limit Order (De Giro),"Hi, I'm trying to figure out how does exactly the 'stop-limit order' offered by De Giro work.

The definition they give is:
*This Order type is designed to limit a Stop Loss Order. The Stop Limit Order provides a limit to a Stop Loss Order. As soon as the price of a share reaches your 'stop limit' level, the Stop Loss Order is stopped. Effectively this means that once the 'stop limit' price is reached, the Stop Limit Order becomes a Limit Order to buy or sell at the limit price or better.*

When setting it up, you fill in 3 boxes:
* Quantity
* Limit
* Stop loss

Let's say I have  bought (long) 100 shares I bought for 10$ each.
If I set up a [Sell] order with the following:
* Quantity: 100
* Limit: $15
* Stop loss: $13

Would this work like a trailing profit stop loss? Thus, if the price goes to $14, stop-loss at $13 gets activated. And then, if price drops to $13, [Sell] stop-loss goes through at $13. And if price goes up to $15, [Sell] limit order goes through at $15?

Am I getting it right? I'm trying to figure out if 'stop-limit order' can be used to setup taking profits and exiting.

Also, what about the opposite scenario. How to set this order up for reacting to price dropping below $10 to exit before massive loss?
Bear with me if I got it all wrong, trying to figure out how it works and what uses can it have.
Thanks in advance.",2017-11-09,0,5

2xmbnr_DE,DE,Why did media report Warren Buffett sold off DE position when he didn't?,"I'm a little annoyed because I had bought some DE when it briefly traded under 80.  It came out a little later that Buffett had sold his DE position so I stupidly sold mine.  Well, it turns out he not only didn't sell his position but he added.  Can someone explain why this happened?  

I have seen that it is because he got special treatment to hide accumulation.  What is the difference between what happened with DE and IBM?  He just recently added to IBM, but it wasn't reported that he sold out of IBM while he was adding to it.  Doesn't make sense.  

Interestingly now it looks like Warren sold XOM.  But did he really?  Could it be that he is really adding?  It's hard to tell because when he was adding to DE it showed he didn't have any, but when he was adding to IBM it showed he still had his original stake.",2015-03-02,0,10
