1k03son_DG,DG,DG stock future?,"Hello, I’m quite new to stocks so forgive any arrogance. I was just wondering what people’s thoughts were on Dollar General. Especially with a weak dollar and possible recession. 

I know they are going through some times right now, but is there value there? ",2025-04-15,5,6
1jif94q_DG,DG,Dollar General,"Really just a few thoughts that are somewhat picked up by different online write-ups in Seeking Alpha and elsewhere, but I wanted to underscore a few points because it seems like the fear baked into the stock revolves around the threat of Walmart, weak stores with lots of shrink, EPS and revenue growth. Those fears to me seem like they are less likely than the current stock price assumes.

All the other consumer discretionaries have indicated a weak forecast in 2025, but the recent earnings call by DG indicated that they are seeing significant amounts of trade down from ""upper end consumers"" INTO their stores and are extremely bullish. Why consumers are trading down to the discount model would seem to be a macro economic fear and/or weakened personal finances?

They're completely overhauling things get back to their 6-7% gross margin with re-installed leadership. No more self-checkout, new distribution, streamlined supply, closing non-profitable stores  to focus on rural communities where the alternative is a gas station. Few are going to drive 80 miles roundtrip to save $4 or even $14.

Revenue is up. Just need to control the SGI to bring their EPS way up, and that seems inevitable.

They have less exposure to tariffs than their competitors. So little effect on costs but if macro uncertainty leads to layoffs and recessionary pressure they would benefit. They only get 4% of their stock directly from China and of course, some of their suppliers get more, but their bread and butter is domestic food stuffs. Their competitors will have to absorb more costs and they can in turn raise prices for higher margins. 

They've been beaten down for so long. Could they finally be ready for even a dead cat bounce?

Analysts at the banks are making the very simplistic assumption that they will lose customers because they'll go to Walmart for cost savings. That presupposes that consumers are both rational and plan well in advance, and it neglects the obvious: that their revenues are UP and that theory is shown to be false. Consumers, it turns out, don't follow their presuppositions. ",2025-03-24,17,15

# Macro Overview:

# Retail Sector Trends

In recent years, the discount retail sector has faced significant pressure. Discount retailers like Dollar General, [Dollar Tree](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DLTR/) and [Five Below](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIVE/) have been experiencing rising costs leading to margins being squeezed. Supply chain constraints and wage increases have contributed mightily to profitability deterioration.

While the discount retail sector undergoing challenges, large retailers like [Walmart](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WMT/), [Costco](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COST/), and [Amazon](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/) have flourished. Inflation continues to play a significant role despite declining significantly from its [June 2022 peak of 9.1%](https://www.cbtnews.com/feds-hold-interest-rates-steady-amid-uncertainty-around-inflation-trumps-policy-changes/). As inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the discount retail sector will continue to face pressure.

# Rising Shrink and Inventory Losses

Shrink, the industry term for theft, have contributed to billions of losses each year across the retail industry. [According to Capital One Research](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/shoplifting-statistics/), stores lost $121.6 billion to retail theft in 2023 with projections indicating shoplifting could cost retailers $143 billion in 2025.

In particular, Dollar General noted in their Q3 earnings report that shrink was a major reason for margin compression. As a result, self-checkout has been removed in some stores and converted to assisted checkout. High employee turnover across the industry has lead many stores to be understaffed further exacerbating shrink concerns.

# Tariff implementation

[President Trump recently announced](https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-says-trump-tariffs-184354384.html) he would place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as 10% tariffs on goods from China effective February 1st. If officially implemented, this will dramatically impact the U.S. economy, consumer spending, and the entire retail sector. Retailers will likely increase costs on thousands of goods. This comes at a time when consumers have already cut back.

Take Dollar General for example. Price-sensitive consumers are their bread and butter so to speak. Further increases will deter them even more so than they have already been in recent years. Consumables account for 82.9% of Dollar General’s Q3 sales. With such heavy reliance on this segment, increased tariffs may hurt margins even further.

# Investment Thesis:

Short-term pressure has caused a steep decline in profitability metrics with low single-digit growth. Despite this, Dollar General remains a strong brand with an established presence in rural America. What separates them from their competition, is the niche audience they serve, where other retailers are not available. This strategy bodes well for them in undeserved markets regardless of the economic outlook. They may continue to face margin erosion in the short-term but their footprint in the U.S. and market appeal remains in tact.

# Key Drivers

* **Expansion Strategy & Project Elevate:** Dollar General remains focused on the future after their Q3 results. For fiscal year ending January 30, 2026 (fiscal year 2025), 4,885 real estate projects are expected. This includes approximately 575 new stores, with 15 in Mexico. Also in Q3, “[Project Elevate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2024/12/06/dollar-general-store-expansion-pledge-despite-sector-challenges/)” was announced. The plan includes expanding their store remodel program to approximately 2,250 stores and the relocation of 45 stores. Same-store sales increased by 1.3% indicating current stress may be showing signs of improvement. Cash & equivalents grew by 47% to $537.26 million compared to net debt of $5.72 billion which declined by -16.4%.
* **Current Valuation:** As of January 29, 2025, the stock has a current price of $72.04, its lowest levels since late 2017. As you can see below from the charts via [MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DG/dollar-general/stock-price-history), Dollar General’s stock has declined substantially in the 1-year period as well as the 5-year period by -44.9% and -51.1% respectively. This has resulted in a P/E ratio of just 11.70, significantly below their 5-year average of 20.1. Dollar General has declined significantly yet they still pay a strong dividend with a yield of 3.3% adding to the attractiveness as well as the clear undervaluation.

# Conclusion

The recent significant declines in Dollar General’s stock positions them to be at their lowest share price since 2017. Ironically, the company has grown from $21.99 billion to $38.69 billion, an increase of 75% in those eight years. Short-term headwinds have created serious pressures on the company in recent years. Inflation first reached elevated levels. Now, it remains stubborn. Profitability has decreased substantially. Despite this, the increase in revenue and persistence in expansion has not stopped Dollar General from charging ahead.

# Risk Factors:

* **Competitive Pressures:** Walmart continues to invest billions in e-commerce, curbside pickup, and grocery delivery. Dollar General only offers these services at select locations and typically do not offer same-say delivery for groceries like Walmart. Walmart uses its supplier network and distribution effectively. This strategy allows them to offer lower prices on many essential goods that can undercut Dollar General. Dollar General has made notable strides in e-commerce and curbside pickup options, Walmart’s infrastructure is vastly superior.
* **Regulatory & Tariff Risk:** On February 1st, 2025, President Trump [signed an executive order](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-slaps-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-risking-higher-prices-us-consu-rcna190185). The order issues tariffs for goods coming into the U.S from Canada, Mexico, and China. While it is unclear when the tariffs will take effect, it is certain they will impact consumers significantly. The possibility of them being lifted remains unknown. Consumables in particular account for the vast majority of total sales. [According to Third Way](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-inflation-grocery-store-food-prices/), grocery items are projected to increase by 15% as a result of tariffs. If that analysis is correct, the increased costs will primarily affect Dollar General’s customers the worst as they tend to be the most cost-conscious.",2025-02-02,22,80

1hrjw31_DG,DG,Dollar General DD -- Why I'm Not Investing,"Figured I'd share my DD on Dollar General as it piqued my interest as an undervalued stock with meaningful upside if it can improve margins in certain areas. Conclusion is that the company is probably fairly valued, potentially over valued. Details below, can share excel file with detailed calcs if desired. All data is pulled from their 10-K/Qs.



For this type of company, I look at EV/EBITDA-Capex as an assessment of valuation. Reason: 1) Capex is a meaningful piece of their business model as it requires new store openings to fuel future growth 2) too many games can be played with depreciation via accounting so may not fairly represent cash outflows needed to support or maintain growth via new store openings. Capex achieves this. 3) I want to remove capital structure from valuation assessment initially. Summary: EV/EBITDA-Capex ranges from 11.7-21.9 from FY14-FY22. Currently at 23.2.



Next, I looked at what has been fueling their revenue growth over the past decade. Outside of macro gyrations in same store revenue growth, it appears their main growth driver has been opening new stores each year. For the past decade, they have increased their store count \~5-6% each year consistently, except for this year. This year, they are only increasing new stores 3.6%, while investing meaningful capex in their current stores to improve same store revenue. Next year, they have guided only increasing store count by 575, or roughly 2.8%. This decline shows that they may be reaching market saturation and the quality of new store markets is declining. This can be supported by the duopoly held by DG and Dollar Tree (\~60% market share combined).



Next, I looked at Capex and how that has trended. From 2014-2020, they had a capex / revenue of \~2-3%. Consistently opening new stores at \~$750k each (ignoring maintenance capex so the real number is likely less). 2021+, this quickly increased to 4.4% of revenue in 2023, while they were maintaining 5-6% increase in store count each year. In 2024, they reduced this back to 3.3% of rev based on latest guidance but keep in mind new store increases have declined to 3.6% in 2024. This tells me management has decided that the capex needed to maintain store count increases consistent with the past decade is not the best decision for shareholders. Instead, they have decided to pull capex back to nominal levels (\~3%) but sacrifice on new store growth.



TLDR / Conclusion :: Overall this stock caught my eye as potentially undervalued but after review I don't think this is a slam dunk buy. Their business model in 2014-2020 was excellent, as supported by their stock growth, as they were able to consistently increase store count 5-6% each year to fuel growth at a sustainable and attractive capex level. It appears post covid, they have faced a two headed dragon of inflation (increasing $ amount to open new stores) and market saturation. This has fundamentally changed their business model and resulting valuation. They are no longer a growth company but I suspect will slowly switch to value extraction / mature company and should be valued as such. Expect valuations similar to other mature retailers in the range of 10-15x EV/EBITDA-Capex. Their current EV/EBITDA-Capex of 23.2 should first be adjusted to update Capex ratio to something more consistent with a mature retailer (2% of rev) before comparing to a typical valuation.



Other worthy notes:

* They have $500M in cash and $2B+ in operating cash flows. They are in a strong cash position notwithstanding the large debt recently issued. If they scale back capex like they have already started doing, operating cash flows should support both maintenance capex required and debt repayment, resulting in a minor common equity lift due to debt repayment.
* Their strategy is to improve their store offerings in current stores and move into fresh produce, which traditionally has poor margins and is a tough business. This can be seen in their GM and inventory in the past couple years. Tough problem to manage successfully moving forward.
* They paused share repurchases which is a bad signal to management, instead opting for an increasing dividend, which aligns with their shift from a growth company to a mature value based company.
* If they are able to either demonstrate international product market fit with their Mexico test expansion (47 stores) or take a meaningful market share of fresh grocery market, then this may change my assessment, but I don't view this as likely.
* The only time they’ve had same store rev growth meaningfully higher than inflation was during 01,08 recessions (8-9%) and post covid stim checks (10%+). Need similar event to have meaningful upside. Could be decent recession hedge.

# OpenAI Nears Funding Round at More Than $100 Billion Valuation

OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT, is reportedly gearing up to raise a new round of funding that could value the company at a whopping $100 billion. The tech firm, best known for revolutionizing how we chat with machines, is currently deep in discussions to secure several billion dollars from investors.

**The major players?** Thrive Capital is leading the charge, set to throw in a cool $1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) isn't sitting on the sidelines either. The tech giant, which already has a hefty $13 billion stake in OpenAI, is expected to chip in more funds to keep their AI bromance strong.

But that’s not all. Rumor has it Apple and Nvidia might also join the investment frenzy, with Apple looking to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, making your iPhone chats a whole lot smarter. Nvidia, a key supplier for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure, could benefit from increased demand for their chips as OpenAI’s need for computing power grows.

# The AI Arms Race is On

OpenAI’s latest funding effort isn't just about beefing up its balance sheet; it's about keeping its place at the forefront of the AI arms race. The startup is racing against heavyweights like Google, Amazon, and Meta, each pouring billions into developing their own AI tech. Google and Amazon recently backed Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, while Meta is giving away its AI models for free.

With AI predicted to transform the global economy, all the big players are jostling for a piece of the pie. OpenAI’s annualized revenue hit $3.4 billion earlier this year, a figure that's sure to swell as the company rolls out more products and services.

# Cash to Burn

What’s driving this scramble for funds? OpenAI’s ambitions are as high as its valuation. CEO Sam Altman is chasing the lofty goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can outperform humans at just about any job. But achieving AGI isn’t cheap. Building their latest model, GPT-4, set them back over $100 million, and the next one will likely cost even more.

**In-house perks:** The new funding round could also benefit OpenAI’s employees, who might get the chance to cash in some of their shares later this year, according to a memo from CFO Sarah Friar. It’s a sweet deal in a speculative market that isn’t yet raking in cash at the same pace as it’s spending.

# Bottom Line

OpenAI is pushing hard to stay on top in the AI world, and it’s getting the cash to do it. With investors lining up to back the startup, all eyes will be on how it uses these billions to outmaneuver the competition and build the next generation of AI tech. And with Apple and Nvidia potentially joining the fray, the battle for AI supremacy just got even more interesting.

# Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom

Dell Technologies ($DELL) is riding the AI wave, and it’s paying off big time. The tech giant reported a 9% jump in total revenue to $25 billion for the fiscal second quarter, crushing Wall Street’s expectations. The driving force? A surge in demand for AI-optimized servers.

# AI Servers: The Star of the Show

Dell’s AI-optimized server sales skyrocketed to $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the prior period. The server unit, part of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, saw a 38% increase in sales to $11.65 billion, beating estimates by a wide margin. Dell's success is largely tied to the booming demand for AI servers, especially those built around Nvidia’s ($NVDA) chips.

Despite some concerns over margins due to the high costs of AI servers and a competitive pricing environment, Dell's operating margin for its infrastructure unit improved to 11%, up from 8% last quarter. This easing of margin worries suggests Dell’s investments in AI are beginning to pay off.

# PC Sales Still in a Slump

While AI servers are flying off the shelves, Dell's traditional PC business is struggling. Revenue from personal computers dropped 4% to $12.4 billion, with consumer sales plummeting 22% from a year ago. The decline reflects the ongoing challenges in the PC market as the pandemic-driven surge in laptop purchases continues to cool down.

Business PC sales remained flat, a stark contrast to rival HP Inc., which saw an 8% gain in enterprise PC sales during the same period. Dell’s COO, Jeff Clarke, noted that recovery in the PC market is still ""a little further out"" than previously anticipated.

# SecureWorks: On the Chopping Block?

In a move to streamline operations, Dell is reportedly exploring the sale of SecureWorks Corp. ($SCWX), a cybersecurity company it currently owns a majority stake in. This isn’t Dell’s first attempt to offload SecureWorks; a previous sale effort back in 2019 fell through. With a market value of about $772 million, SecureWorks’ future under Dell’s umbrella remains uncertain.

# What’s Next for Dell?

Looking ahead, Dell has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $24.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The company also revised its full-year guidance slightly upwards, now expecting between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion in revenue, up from a previous range of $93.5 billion to $97.5 billion.

Dell’s stock has been on a tear this year, up 48% so far. With AI server demand showing no signs of slowing, the company seems well-positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. However, challenges in the PC market and questions about long-term profitability remain on the horizon. For now, though, it seems like Dell is enjoying its moment in the AI spotlight.

# Dollar General’s Big Miss: What Happened?

Dollar General ($DG) just experienced its worst day ever on Wall Street. The discount retailer's shares nosedived 32% after the company slashed its full-year forecast, citing a tough financial climate for its core customers—those living paycheck to paycheck. This is the biggest drop since the company went public in 2009.

# The Bad News

CEO Todd Vasos reported that the company had to cut its 2024 forecasts for comparable sales and earnings due to customers tightening their belts, particularly on essential goods. Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise only 1% to 1.6% for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 2% to 2.7%. The company’s profit forecast was also reduced, predicting earnings per share between $5.50 and $6.20, significantly lower than the previous $6.80 to $7.55.

Sales in the second fiscal quarter fell short of expectations, with earnings per share at $1.70 compared to the $1.79 analysts had anticipated. Revenue was also below forecasts, coming in at $10.21 billion against the predicted $10.37 billion. Despite a slight uptick in traffic, shoppers are spending less per visit, hitting Dollar General where it hurts—right in the sales figures.

# Blame Game

Vasos blamed the poor performance on weakening consumer sentiment among lower-income shoppers, who are finding it harder to make ends meet due to economic pressures like high interest rates. However, other discount retailers like Walmart are reporting strong sales, indicating that the problem might not just be with consumers but also with Dollar General’s execution.

Dollar General is now focusing on “controlling what we can control,” as Vasos put it. This includes efforts to improve store operations and inventory management, but it seems the company still has a long road ahead to turn things around.

# The Ripple Effect

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) wasn’t immune to Dollar General’s woes, with shares sliding 10.24% in sympathy. Big Lots ($BIG) also took a hit, plummeting 38.35%. Meanwhile, Best Buy ($BBY) saw a surge of 14.11%, buoyed by its stronger-than-expected earnings report and a more optimistic consumer outlook.

# What’s Next For The General?

Dollar General’s game plan involves cutting back on new store openings, slashing inventory, and focusing more on essential goods. However, with customers running out of funds towards the end of each month and competition from big players like Walmart, the retailer will need more than just tweaks to its operations to get back on track.

Despite the grim outlook, some analysts are still holding out hope. With an average price target of $144, there’s a belief that the stock could rebound—if Dollar General can address its operational shortcomings and the economic pressure on its customers eases. But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect any blockbuster announcements tomorrow. But before you check out for the long weekend, there’s one final, crucial piece of economic news on the horizon.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)—the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge—is set to drop. For those who aren’t economists in their spare time, PCE measures how much prices are rising or falling across the U.S. economy. The “core” PCE strips out food and energy prices (you know, the stuff that makes your wallet cry at the pump or grocery store) to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation.

And here’s the thing: Everyone is banking on the Fed to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting, no matter what tomorrow’s PCE report shows. But this is the last major inflation reading before the Fed gathers to make its big decision, so the numbers could sway just how aggressive they go with those rate cuts. In other words, tomorrow’s PCE could be the final puzzle piece in the Fed’s inflation-fighting game.",2024-08-29,2,0

The decline reflects the ongoing challenges in the PC market as the pandemic-driven surge in laptop purchases continues to cool down.

Business PC sales remained flat, a stark contrast to rival HP Inc., which saw an 8% gain in enterprise PC sales during the same period. Dell’s COO, Jeff Clarke, noted that recovery in the PC market is still ""a little further out"" than previously anticipated.

# SecureWorks: On the Chopping Block?

In a move to streamline operations, Dell is reportedly exploring the sale of SecureWorks Corp. ($SCWX), a cybersecurity company it currently owns a majority stake in. This isn’t Dell’s first attempt to offload SecureWorks; a previous sale effort back in 2019 fell through. With a market value of about $772 million, SecureWorks’ future under Dell’s umbrella remains uncertain.

# What’s Next for Dell?

Looking ahead, Dell has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $24.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The company also revised its full-year guidance slightly upwards, now expecting between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion in revenue, up from a previous range of $93.5 billion to $97.5 billion.

Dell’s stock has been on a tear this year, up 48% so far. With AI server demand showing no signs of slowing, the company seems well-positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. However, challenges in the PC market and questions about long-term profitability remain on the horizon. For now, though, it seems like Dell is enjoying its moment in the AI spotlight.

# Dollar General’s Big Miss: What Happened?

Dollar General ($DG) just experienced its worst day ever on Wall Street. The discount retailer's shares nosedived 32% after the company slashed its full-year forecast, citing a tough financial climate for its core customers—those living paycheck to paycheck. This is the biggest drop since the company went public in 2009.

# The Bad News

CEO Todd Vasos reported that the company had to cut its 2024 forecasts for comparable sales and earnings due to customers tightening their belts, particularly on essential goods. Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise only 1% to 1.6% for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 2% to 2.7%. The company’s profit forecast was also reduced, predicting earnings per share between $5.50 and $6.20, significantly lower than the previous $6.80 to $7.55.

Sales in the second fiscal quarter fell short of expectations, with earnings per share at $1.70 compared to the $1.79 analysts had anticipated. Revenue was also below forecasts, coming in at $10.21 billion against the predicted $10.37 billion. Despite a slight uptick in traffic, shoppers are spending less per visit, hitting Dollar General where it hurts—right in the sales figures.

# Blame Game

Vasos blamed the poor performance on weakening consumer sentiment among lower-income shoppers, who are finding it harder to make ends meet due to economic pressures like high interest rates. However, other discount retailers like Walmart are reporting strong sales, indicating that the problem might not just be with consumers but also with Dollar General’s execution.

Dollar General is now focusing on “controlling what we can control,” as Vasos put it. This includes efforts to improve store operations and inventory management, but it seems the company still has a long road ahead to turn things around.

# The Ripple Effect

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) wasn’t immune to Dollar General’s woes, with shares sliding 10.24% in sympathy. Big Lots ($BIG) also took a hit, plummeting 38.35%. Meanwhile, Best Buy ($BBY) saw a surge of 14.11%, buoyed by its stronger-than-expected earnings report and a more optimistic consumer outlook.

# What’s Next For The General?

Dollar General’s game plan involves cutting back on new store openings, slashing inventory, and focusing more on essential goods. However, with customers running out of funds towards the end of each month and competition from big players like Walmart, the retailer will need more than just tweaks to its operations to get back on track.

Despite the grim outlook, some analysts are still holding out hope. With an average price target of $144, there’s a belief that the stock could rebound—if Dollar General can address its operational shortcomings and the economic pressure on its customers eases. But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect any blockbuster announcements tomorrow. But before you check out for the long weekend, there’s one final, crucial piece of economic news on the horizon.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)—the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge—is set to drop. For those who aren’t economists in their spare time, PCE measures how much prices are rising or falling across the U.S. economy. The “core” PCE strips out food and energy prices (you know, the stuff that makes your wallet cry at the pump or grocery store) to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation.

And here’s the thing: Everyone is banking on the Fed to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting, no matter what tomorrow’s PCE report shows. But this is the last major inflation reading before the Fed gathers to make its big decision, so the numbers could sway just how aggressive they go with those rate cuts. In other words, tomorrow’s PCE could be the final puzzle piece in the Fed’s inflation-fighting game.",2024-08-29,2,0

# OpenAI Nears Funding Round at More Than $100 Billion Valuation

OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT, is reportedly gearing up to raise a new round of funding that could value the company at a whopping $100 billion. The tech firm, best known for revolutionizing how we chat with machines, is currently deep in discussions to secure several billion dollars from investors.

**The major players?** Thrive Capital is leading the charge, set to throw in a cool $1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) isn't sitting on the sidelines either. The tech giant, which already has a hefty $13 billion stake in OpenAI, is expected to chip in more funds to keep their AI bromance strong.

But that’s not all. Rumor has it Apple and Nvidia might also join the investment frenzy, with Apple looking to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, making your iPhone chats a whole lot smarter. Nvidia, a key supplier for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure, could benefit from increased demand for their chips as OpenAI’s need for computing power grows.

# The AI Arms Race is On

OpenAI’s latest funding effort isn't just about beefing up its balance sheet; it's about keeping its place at the forefront of the AI arms race. The startup is racing against heavyweights like Google, Amazon, and Meta, each pouring billions into developing their own AI tech. Google and Amazon recently backed Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, while Meta is giving away its AI models for free.

With AI predicted to transform the global economy, all the big players are jostling for a piece of the pie. OpenAI’s annualized revenue hit $3.4 billion earlier this year, a figure that's sure to swell as the company rolls out more products and services.

# Cash to Burn

What’s driving this scramble for funds? OpenAI’s ambitions are as high as its valuation. CEO Sam Altman is chasing the lofty goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can outperform humans at just about any job. But achieving AGI isn’t cheap. Building their latest model, GPT-4, set them back over $100 million, and the next one will likely cost even more.

**In-house perks:** The new funding round could also benefit OpenAI’s employees, who might get the chance to cash in some of their shares later this year, according to a memo from CFO Sarah Friar. It’s a sweet deal in a speculative market that isn’t yet raking in cash at the same pace as it’s spending.

# Bottom Line

OpenAI is pushing hard to stay on top in the AI world, and it’s getting the cash to do it. With investors lining up to back the startup, all eyes will be on how it uses these billions to outmaneuver the competition and build the next generation of AI tech. And with Apple and Nvidia potentially joining the fray, the battle for AI supremacy just got even more interesting.

# Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom

Dell Technologies ($DELL) is riding the AI wave, and it’s paying off big time. The tech giant reported a 9% jump in total revenue to $25 billion for the fiscal second quarter, crushing Wall Street’s expectations. The driving force? A surge in demand for AI-optimized servers.

# AI Servers: The Star of the Show

Dell’s AI-optimized server sales skyrocketed to $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the prior period. The server unit, part of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, saw a 38% increase in sales to $11.65 billion, beating estimates by a wide margin. Dell's success is largely tied to the booming demand for AI servers, especially those built around Nvidia’s ($NVDA) chips.

Despite some concerns over margins due to the high costs of AI servers and a competitive pricing environment, Dell's operating margin for its infrastructure unit improved to 11%, up from 8% last quarter. This easing of margin worries suggests Dell’s investments in AI are beginning to pay off.

# PC Sales Still in a Slump

1f490b0_DG,DG,Feeling bad for missing out on DG but got DLTR gains,"This Sunday I found out you could buy puts without owning shares of the stock (yes I know I'm regarded) so I started thinking of companies I think are going to move down. Up to this point I had only been doing calls and I had lost a good bit of money from them besides CAVA so it was time for a change in strategy.

The last time I went back home from school I saw that the Family Dollar had closed after only being there for a very short time. I thought Dollar General owned FD so I added this position to my watchlist but after googling I found out that Dollar Tree owns FD, not DG. So I opted to buy some DLTR 9/20 87p instead which were more expensive.

I was hesitant to buy those puts because at the time 110$ was pretty far OTM and I wasn't sure that it would move that far after earnings. Had I bought DG I would've been rich 😭 Oh well back to Wendy's for a little longer. My DLTR puts did still print today following the news. 

Also a good bit of luck my regarded ass accidentally bought some 8/30 95p for DLTR because I didn't look at the expiration date and I just thought ""oh wow these 95$ puts are cheaper than the 87$ puts for the same date. I better buy some."" I sold those 95p today and bought some 9/13 84p.",2024-08-29,12,4

But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect any blockbuster announcements tomorrow. But before you check out for the long weekend, there’s one final, crucial piece of economic news on the horizon.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)—the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge—is set to drop. For those who aren’t economists in their spare time, PCE measures how much prices are rising or falling across the U.S. economy. The “core” PCE strips out food and energy prices (you know, the stuff that makes your wallet cry at the pump or grocery store) to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation.

And here’s the thing: Everyone is banking on the Fed to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting, no matter what tomorrow’s PCE report shows. But this is the last major inflation reading before the Fed gathers to make its big decision, so the numbers could sway just how aggressive they go with those rate cuts. In other words, tomorrow’s PCE could be the final puzzle piece in the Fed’s inflation-fighting game.",2024-08-29,2,0

* The stock market wrapped up a mixed bag of a day as Wall Street digested Nvidia’s less-than-stellar earnings report. The Dow strutted to a new record high, up 0.59% or 244 points, while the Nasdaq took a hit, dropping 0.23% thanks to Nvidia's continued slump. The S&P 500 played it safe, ending the day pretty much flat.
* On the bright side, solid economic data offered some optimism. The second-quarter GDP got a boost, jobless claims edged lower, and inflation showed signs of cooling, with the PCE price index slowing to 2.5%. While Nvidia’s rough patch dragged tech stocks down, the rest of the market mostly brushed it off, with five of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing in the green. Looks like Wall Street is still banking on some good vibes despite a few hiccups.

# OpenAI Nears Funding Round at More Than $100 Billion Valuation

OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT, is reportedly gearing up to raise a new round of funding that could value the company at a whopping $100 billion. The tech firm, best known for revolutionizing how we chat with machines, is currently deep in discussions to secure several billion dollars from investors.

**The major players?** Thrive Capital is leading the charge, set to throw in a cool $1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) isn't sitting on the sidelines either. The tech giant, which already has a hefty $13 billion stake in OpenAI, is expected to chip in more funds to keep their AI bromance strong.

But that’s not all. Rumor has it Apple and Nvidia might also join the investment frenzy, with Apple looking to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, making your iPhone chats a whole lot smarter. Nvidia, a key supplier for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure, could benefit from increased demand for their chips as OpenAI’s need for computing power grows.

# The AI Arms Race is On

OpenAI’s latest funding effort isn't just about beefing up its balance sheet; it's about keeping its place at the forefront of the AI arms race. The startup is racing against heavyweights like Google, Amazon, and Meta, each pouring billions into developing their own AI tech. Google and Amazon recently backed Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, while Meta is giving away its AI models for free.

With AI predicted to transform the global economy, all the big players are jostling for a piece of the pie. OpenAI’s annualized revenue hit $3.4 billion earlier this year, a figure that's sure to swell as the company rolls out more products and services.

# Cash to Burn

What’s driving this scramble for funds? OpenAI’s ambitions are as high as its valuation. CEO Sam Altman is chasing the lofty goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can outperform humans at just about any job. But achieving AGI isn’t cheap. Building their latest model, GPT-4, set them back over $100 million, and the next one will likely cost even more.

**In-house perks:** The new funding round could also benefit OpenAI’s employees, who might get the chance to cash in some of their shares later this year, according to a memo from CFO Sarah Friar. It’s a sweet deal in a speculative market that isn’t yet raking in cash at the same pace as it’s spending.

# Bottom Line

OpenAI is pushing hard to stay on top in the AI world, and it’s getting the cash to do it. With investors lining up to back the startup, all eyes will be on how it uses these billions to outmaneuver the competition and build the next generation of AI tech. And with Apple and Nvidia potentially joining the fray, the battle for AI supremacy just got even more interesting.

# 



# Market Movements

* **Lululemon Lowers Outlook**: Lululemon ($LULU) lowered its sales and profit outlook for the year as increased competition and relentless inflation curb demand for its pricey yoga pants
* **Ulta Beauty Cuts Forecast**: Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) cut its forecast after seeing a decline in comparable store sales in the second quarter, highlighting US consumers cutting back on makeups and cosmetics.
* **xAI Accused of Pollution**: xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, is being accused by the Southern Environmental Law Center of polluting the air in Memphis, Tennessee with unpermitted natural fas burning turbines
* **Plaud. ai Launches NotePin**: Another AI pin is joining the mix despite Humane’s struggles. Plaud .ai released its $10 NotePin, an “always-ready” wearable promising to record and synthesize transcriptions in meets and on the go.
* **SpaceX Grounded by FAA**: The FAA has grounded SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets after a booster rocket failed during landing yesterday.

# Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom

Dell Technologies ($DELL) is riding the AI wave, and it’s paying off big time. The tech giant reported a 9% jump in total revenue to $25 billion for the fiscal second quarter, crushing Wall Street’s expectations. The driving force? A surge in demand for AI-optimized servers.

# AI Servers: The Star of the Show

Dell’s AI-optimized server sales skyrocketed to $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the prior period. The server unit, part of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, saw a 38% increase in sales to $11.65 billion, beating estimates by a wide margin. Dell's success is largely tied to the booming demand for AI servers, especially those built around Nvidia’s ($NVDA) chips.

Despite some concerns over margins due to the high costs of AI servers and a competitive pricing environment, Dell's operating margin for its infrastructure unit improved to 11%, up from 8% last quarter. This easing of margin worries suggests Dell’s investments in AI are beginning to pay off.

# PC Sales Still in a Slump

While AI servers are flying off the shelves, Dell's traditional PC business is struggling. Revenue from personal computers dropped 4% to $12.4 billion, with consumer sales plummeting 22% from a year ago. The decline reflects the ongoing challenges in the PC market as the pandemic-driven surge in laptop purchases continues to cool down.

Business PC sales remained flat, a stark contrast to rival HP Inc., which saw an 8% gain in enterprise PC sales during the same period. Dell’s COO, Jeff Clarke, noted that recovery in the PC market is still ""a little further out"" than previously anticipated.

# SecureWorks: On the Chopping Block?

In a move to streamline operations, Dell is reportedly exploring the sale of SecureWorks Corp. ($SCWX), a cybersecurity company it currently owns a majority stake in. This isn’t Dell’s first attempt to offload SecureWorks; a previous sale effort back in 2019 fell through. With a market value of about $772 million, SecureWorks’ future under Dell’s umbrella remains uncertain.

# What’s Next for Dell?

Looking ahead, Dell has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $24.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The company also revised its full-year guidance slightly upwards, now expecting between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion in revenue, up from a previous range of $93.5 billion to $97.5 billion.

Dell’s stock has been on a tear this year, up 48% so far. With AI server demand showing no signs of slowing, the company seems well-positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. However, challenges in the PC market and questions about long-term profitability remain on the horizon. For now, though, it seems like Dell is enjoying its moment in the AI spotlight.

# Dollar General’s Big Miss: What Happened?

Dollar General ($DG) just experienced its worst day ever on Wall Street. The discount retailer's shares nosedived 32% after the company slashed its full-year forecast, citing a tough financial climate for its core customers—those living paycheck to paycheck. This is the biggest drop since the company went public in 2009.

# The Bad News

CEO Todd Vasos reported that the company had to cut its 2024 forecasts for comparable sales and earnings due to customers tightening their belts, particularly on essential goods. Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise only 1% to 1.6% for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 2% to 2.7%. The company’s profit forecast was also reduced, predicting earnings per share between $5.50 and $6.20, significantly lower than the previous $6.80 to $7.55.

Sales in the second fiscal quarter fell short of expectations, with earnings per share at $1.70 compared to the $1.79 analysts had anticipated. Revenue was also below forecasts, coming in at $10.21 billion against the predicted $10.37 billion. Despite a slight uptick in traffic, shoppers are spending less per visit, hitting Dollar General where it hurts—right in the sales figures.

# Blame Game

Vasos blamed the poor performance on weakening consumer sentiment among lower-income shoppers, who are finding it harder to make ends meet due to economic pressures like high interest rates. However, other discount retailers like Walmart are reporting strong sales, indicating that the problem might not just be with consumers but also with Dollar General’s execution.

Dollar General is now focusing on “controlling what we can control,” as Vasos put it. This includes efforts to improve store operations and inventory management, but it seems the company still has a long road ahead to turn things around.

# The Ripple Effect

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) wasn’t immune to Dollar General’s woes, with shares sliding 10.24% in sympathy. Big Lots ($BIG) also took a hit, plummeting 38.35%. Meanwhile, Best Buy ($BBY) saw a surge of 14.11%, buoyed by its stronger-than-expected earnings report and a more optimistic consumer outlook.

# What’s Next For The General?

Dollar General’s game plan involves cutting back on new store openings, slashing inventory, and focusing more on essential goods. However, with customers running out of funds towards the end of each month and competition from big players like Walmart, the retailer will need more than just tweaks to its operations to get back on track.

Despite the grim outlook, some analysts are still holding out hope. With an average price target of $144, there’s a belief that the stock could rebound—if Dollar General can address its operational shortcomings and the economic pressure on its customers eases. But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.

1bewedg_DG,DG,$DG will flush tomorrow and Q1 here's why,"Hello fellow degens,

Dollar General is going to flush tomorrow and all of Q1.

Their earnings call was a joke today. Company is in the trash. Just take a look at any possible sub reddits of maybe people who work there and it's basically a dumpster fire. Turnover must be nuts.

The CEO was explaining how they are trying to suck less in football yards today as an analogy. Hilarious.

Aside from the stores being dirty and disorganized, here is some main points I would like to bring to your attention.

-They are working to open more locations when their competition is closing 1000 stores. I think the market has had enough of the dollar store. People are going to Walmart and using affirm if they are poor. More stores = more operating costs.

-They want to provide fresh produce at stores. Are they really gonna wanna piss money away on this when they want to control the heat at every store and the toilets are already plugged? Lots of spending for probably no reward in my opinion. If a fridge breaks, it ain't cheap to repair. Allegedly port o pottys outside some stores. I rest my case.

-They are already having less SKUS which means less product = most likely less product with markups.

-Getting rid of self check-out with a person to hire at the front. More renovations will cost them more money.

-High theft from staff and customers.

-High staff turnover isn't cheap.

-Logistics is bad, and with more stores it's probably not gonna get better. Bad logistics=shitty produce.

Stock usually tanks day of earnings and then at least two or three at a minimum just looking at the charts so I don't think this one's done flushing.

I'm in about 6 x 155p. 4 for this week and two for next. Tomorrow I will be buying ITM puts about a month or so out at open because I think this has a lot of room to go down. If you want to gamble some FD's I would also recommend the 148p tomorrow.

On top of all of this their competition Dollar Tree tanked again today, which means the sector is dog crap right now. I sweated this position out all day through all the IV crush and their shitty call and it's gonna pay because I'm fucking right.

Your wife's boyfriend shops at Walmart, Costco and Amazon. Buy puts so you don't have to shop here anymore.

-Pablo

TLDR - $DG is going the way of $BBBY

16egrvo_DG,DG,Rolling $DG Gains into $SMTC,"Good afternoon to all of my fellow…well-wishers and supporters. For those who supported me in that beautiful $DG earnings crash, I salute you. Now, for those who bet with me last time, what is the next play? After sifting through the rubble, I found a diamond in the rough. 

There is a curious situation brewing in a small-cap supplier of semiconductors. I say “small cap” because this once mighty mid-cap company has been torched down to a market capitalization of just $1.5 billion. It began last year at $89 per share, and currently sits at $24. Compared to the broader semiconductor space, Semtec ($SMTC) has grossly underperformed. And now their earnings is scheduled for Sept. 13, presenting a catalyst opportunity. 

Surely this means I’m bullish on a potential regression to the mean? Actually, no. Last Thursday, Sept. 7th, I purchased 100 puts for October 20th at the $20 strike. Why? 

1. Delayed Earnings 

Originally scheduled for 09/07, SMTC announced on 09/06 that their earnings would be delayed. Companies that postpone a previously announced earnings release date underperform the broad market by 2.44% in the 3 days surrounding the
announcement. These companies are also likely to report deteriorating fundamentals, with earnings per share down by about 16% compared to the same period a year ago.

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/documents/sp-global-market-intelligence-signals-in-earnings-report-dates-june-2019.pdf

2. Reason for Earnings Delay 

Not all earnings delays are created equal. For instance, an act of god, such as weather, or a pandemic, such as Covid, can result in generally muted impacts to the stock. 

The problem is that SMTC delayed earnings because “…the Company is working diligently to complete certain procedures to conclude whether a valuation allowance is to be recorded against certain deferred tax assets” - from SMTC investors page. 

Given SMTC’s recent acquisition, this calls into question their ability to generate sufficient future taxable income, which is bizarre and a red flag. 

3. Sudden Change Notice of CFO 

On Sept. 08, it crossed the wire that current CFO Emeka Chukwu would be succeeded by Mark Lin no later than Oct. 4th. Combined with the reasons for the earnings delay, this reeks of potential financial mismanagement, liability concerns, and damage control. 

TLDR: Earnings delay, potential valuation allowance, sudden CFO change are sufficient red flags to bet on lower prices following the Sep. 13th earnings. I purchased 100 Oct. 20 $20 puts. $SMTC",2023-09-09,13,53
166u3ry_DG,DG,Going big on Dollar General ($DG),"For the second quarter in a row, Dollar General ($DG) has taken an absolute pounding following earnings. And this follows a more gradual decline from ATH that started October 2022. Since then they are down nearly 50%. 

$DG is a household name with thousands of stores across the US. While the stores themselves are nothing to write home about, they are cash machines. They have continued to expand on their model for decades without fail. 

Recently, they have run into headwinds largely related to inflation and the outsized impact it’s had on the lower-income folks that make up their consumer base. But I think this is temporary, and see big growth drivers. 

Earnings are down a whopping 33% from last year. Their margins have been eaten by higher supplier prices, increased labor costs and labor needs, and mounting inventory. Their move into groceries and, more specifically, fresh foods has run into some stumbles as a result. 

But sales are still up, albeit only around 2%. They continue to pour investment into new stores, better maintenance, stronger labor force, and other long-term-oriented investment. Additionally, the early signals from their new store idea, pOpshelf, is extremely positive. Customer reviews are through the roof, margins are even higher than their flagship store, and they are planning to jump from 186 current locations to more than 3,000 by the end of 2025. 

Furthermore, we are exiting what I believe to be the worst case scenario for Dollar General. DG is known as an all-weather brand since customers often flock to their stores during tough times. As the economy cools off, they should be able to capitalize on any macro environment that doesn’t include inflation—whether that be a soft landing or a mild recession. 

With the new pOpshelf stores, DG has another growth driver with sky high promise. Once they exit this downcycle they should be poised to return a great deal of cash to their shareholders.

After years of  stuffing their front pockets with corporate greed, they are about to topple down into darkness. 

Behind the facade of “everyday low prices”, people are realizing that Dollar General is actually more expensive. It sells low prices, but in smaller pack sizes than other stores, which pushes per-unit costs higher.

Folks are not this stupid…the General is wearing no clothes, and consumers now know it. 

With the stock waffling at $154, a purge down to $130 seems in order. For reference, look at their last earnings, and for something more recent, Dollar Tree.

[$DG took a beating at every retail earnings announcement last week.](https://preview.redd.it/7zaz0dvlug191.jpg?width=2996&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ac06aca5f8d9067afd8080e865e0a598ea2fb91)

$DG serves your mom, dad, aunts, uncles and fellow Wendy's associates in small town america (or urban America).  They are a neighborhood convenience store.  Here's how they describe themselves in their 10-K: ""providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores.""  $DG is a no-frills shopping experience where average to poor people can pick up household goods inexpensively.  They don't own expensive real-estate or obsess over curb-appeal.  Most stores are run by a crew of 3.  They have very small stock rooms and manage their own logistics.

Why did $WMT and $TGT earnings crash the market?

* Summary: Higher food costs [prompted shoppers to shift their spending](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pandemic-was-supposed-to-push-all-shopping-online-it-didnt-11650081652?mod=article_inline) away from general merchandise, eating into profits.  Inventory levels also rose too fast, said executives, causing Walmart to put more goods on sale.  Walmart’s (chose) to buy products aggressively amid supply-chain snarls and rising demand for some goods in past quarters. Product markdowns, when a retailer sells an item at a discount, were $100 million more than expected in the quarter.  Online buying behavior has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels.

* Summary: Sales at the Minneapolis-based retailer (Target) increased in the most recent quarter as shoppers spent more on food and groceries.  On Wednesday, the company said earnings for the April quarter were hurt by higher markdown rates and inventory impairments, and lower-than-expected sales in those discretionary categories (kitchen appliances, television sets and furniture).  Target said that while some prices had risen, wider price increases would continue to be the last lever it would pull to improve profit because it was aware that its customers were seeking affordability.

$DG is NOT LIKE $WMT or $TGT!  Why?

1. The majority of $DG sales are from consumer essentials (75%).  Both $WMT and $TGT showed demand for these goods are up.
2. $WMT and $TGT inventory woes are due to appliances, electronics and furniture.  $DG goods rarely exceed a $10 sticker price.  $DG is not paying for premium warehouse space to sit on TVs and furniture that they will mark down in the future, like $WMT and $TGT.
3. $DG does not have a large online shopping infrastructure like $WMT and $TGT.  This means they won't see the pull back in online shopping and incremental costs like $WMT.  Let's be honest, $DG's customers shop online at $WISH (Calls on $WISH).
4. $DG stores are located close to the consumer.  Their store placement is driven by getting close to where the consumer lives, works and goes to school.  If gas is too expensive, you can walk or ride your rascal to the local $DG.
5. Both $WMT and $TGT are hesitant to raise prices on consumer essentials because they know their shoppers would just go to $DG who has very low operational costs and can afford to offer the lowest prices on these goods.
6. Here's some real world DD.  Look what you can get from $DG for $20!  You can feed yourself for a few days here.  Take your earnings from Wendy's and go shop at $DG when you get tired of Chicken Nuggets.

$DG is not $WMT and $TGT and their shares should recover from the punishment they took with $WMT and $TGT last week.  $DG could make $230/share by Friday.  If you buy calls, get in before earnings on Thursday.  Even $DG bagholding should be rewarded during the recession.

mbvmqe_DG,DG,Dollar General to curb logistics costs by expanding private truck fleet,"

Dive Brief:Dollar General is contending with continued high carrier rates and fuel costs, CFO John Garratt said during the company's earnings call Thursday. Increased costs are also stemming from discretionary bonuses for trucking employees, as well as for workers in distribution centers, Garratt said.To help mitigate transport costs, the company plans to further expand its private truck fleet, Garratt said. The private fleet accounted for more than 20% of outbound logistics at the end of last year, COO Jeff Owen said on the call.The retailer said the recent opening of its dry distribution center in Walton, Kentucky, is expected to help it reduce stem miles and, therefore, costs. It also plans to open two DG Fresh facilities this year, including a combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Nebraska, which Owen said should reduce stem miles over time.

Dive Insight:

Pandemic-driven volume increases were responsible for a portion of the increases in transportation and distribution costs, Dollar General said. And buyers aren't expected to let up on spending any time soon.

""With another round of stimulus checks being mailed right now, we expect another large boost in consumer spending over the next few months,"" National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement last week.

But high logistics costs can offset gains in sales. In a recent McKinsey survey of CPG companies, 80% said they did not expect transportation costs to decrease this year from 2020's elevated levels.

""We feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion,"" said Garratt. ""But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So ... these will weigh in the near term.""

Increased volume, mixed with a shortage of trucks and people to drive them, have pushed up truckload rates. Volatility in the trucking market has prompted shippers to focus on procuring reliable carrier capacity.

For some shippers, that means diversification. For others, it means becoming a shipper of choice and leaning on dedicated services, or signing their fleets over to specialists in a conversion to manage capacity.

Dollar General's fleet-bulking strategy would allow it to more frequently skip the third-party pool. Demand surges have kept spot prices elevated.

The pandemic has also put pressure on efficient distribution, though large retailers have been reexamining their networks since before the coronavirus. Surging e-commerce volumes reinforced the need for more capacity.

United Natural Foods and Williams-Sonoma have invested in distribution expansions, with focuses on automation. Dollar General spent $1 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, including planned investments in distribution and transportation, the CFO said

lzzgte_DG,DG,DD DG (Dollar General) - poor folks love it!,"Obligatory not trying to distract from GME. I'm in at $310 so please pick me up on the way to the moon.

Long time lurker - first time poster. I'm retarded and my portfolio is red over the past year so do not listen to me, this is not financial advice.

Dollar general stock is down ~20% over the last 6 months and barely up since the beginning of the pandemic.

But IMO there is no reason for it. They have beaten earnings and revenue projections the last 4 quarters. The narrative is that they only beat because of the pandemic retail boost and it is not sustainable. But we are going to be in the ""pandemic economy"" for a long long time. DG stock is going to double in the next 2 years and let me tell you why:

- These fuckers own the retail market for lower income folks. My sister works at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville and there is literally a Dollar General right next to her house. They go head to head with Walmart and don't give a fuck.
- Poor people fucking love Dollar General. They have brand recognition and brand loyalty. Go to bumfuck Missouri, sit outside a gas station, and ask everyone who walks in which is cooler - Walmart or DG - I guarantee 9 out of 10 will say DG.
- They are beginning to experiment with their own brands. This will go well. Imagine you can buy a case of beer and the cans just say ""Beer"" on them. Who wouldn't fucking buy that?
- This stimulus package is perfect for DG. We are literally handing poor folks thousands of dollars right now PLUS the increased child tax credit will be hugely beneficial to DG customers. Do you understand how many children these people have? And where do you think they are going to spend their stimulus checks? They aren't buying stocks or driving into the goddamn big city to shop at Target or Best Buy. They are taking those checks straight to DG and buying extra groceries, beauty products, alcohol, lawn chairs, electronics, and more. Yes, literally everything poor people need is sold at DG.
- If inflation ever hits, everyone is going to be shopping at DG. It's not like the current customers have a cheaper alternative to turn to. If when inflation hits prices and not our paychecks, more and more of us will be pushed to shop at DG.
- DG stock is being held down because every granny with a checkbook is buying tech stocks right now. But when that bubble finally bursts, people will remember that it's ok to own stock is companies that actually fucking make money. DG is bubble proof and will benefit from the bubble bursting twofold. People who lose in the bubble will be forced to buy DG stock as well as shop at DG for daily goods.
- They are starting to dabble in tech and online shopping. I'm not saying they are going to pivot to machine learning. But they do have the data and consumer loyalty to suck more out of their market.
- DG still sells tobacco and will own that market as larger corporations bow to pressure not to tell cigs. Maybe Biden legalizes weed and DG starts selling marijuana loosies?
They are nimbler and more flexible than Walmart, Target, etc. They are much, much better at meeting local tastes. You can buy locally sourced beef jerky at DG. They will figure out ways to insert themselves into more and more markets.
- Analysts are nervous about their current weird CEO ""search"". Pretty soon they will either announce a hot new hire or announce that they are keeping their current CEO with some hot new initiatives. Stock goes up either way.


tl;dr Poor people love Dollar General. Stock will double in the next 2 years.

I own Jan 2023 calls at 240 and 250. I think the stock rises sooner than that but want them sweet, sweet long term cap gains taxes.",2021-03-07,68,81

Dollar General is near its 6M low, incredibly oversold and anything near 190 is a fucking steal. Overall, the RSI is 41 on the yearly and trading well under the 50 and 200 SMA.

I know the F word is shunned here and I don't use it very much, but the FUNDAMENTALS ARE FUCKING CRAZY. With these fundamentals the price it's trading at it is criminal. After consulting the Bloomberg terminal, the monkey analysts have a price target of $235 and the majority of them have buy ratings on the stock. In addition, Dollar General has an estimated revenue of +20%  YoY and a P/E ratio of 19. Overall the sentiment on DG is very bullish, and If you don't give a shit about what the analysts say the value of the stock is shown in the fundamentals, they are just confirmation bias.

Earnings is on March 11, I expect a good run up correction before then. The Fundamentals show that IT LITERALLY CANT GO TITS UP.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks.

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****.

For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares.

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

iu82wo_DG,DG,Dollar General (DG) will be the last surviving retail store,"Dollar General was modeled after German Convenient Stores, and the store model is great unlike Walmart and Target. They are nationwIde, and they have very low operating costs compared to Walmart and Target. We all know  big box retail is on its way out as it was proven during the pandemic, e-commerce is in. But there will still be a need for brick and mortar stores, that’s where Dollar General wins big, with huge profit margins, and room to grow. Two years from now they will be a 400$ stock.

So let me tell you what i beleive in, the status QUO.

Most americans are middle class and thrifty and borderline poor.

DT has last Q1 beat by a shitton (This was the COVID freshman boy time; now COVID is a sophmore almost a junior at University). And so with that logic, it will defeat with blazing laser guns Q2; and beat expectations.

although they have been flat stock, with bysiness slim razor margins, they beat last Q, and this Q they will destroy ER and give us all those tendies we feen!!

Whiiel everyone is distrcated calling BA and HD and waiting for SPY to finally drop. Dollar funnn general will buck up into ER.

fh0x1f_DG,DG,Dollar General (DG) - 3/12/2020 Market Hours - Discount Retail Winner,"Stock: **Dollar General (DG) - 162.88$**

Direction: **Neutral**

**Price Target:** **160$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Dollar General is a superior discount retailer with great cashflow and constantly improving store metrics. It also has a dividend payout of 0.77% annually. Dollar General has mostly survived the coronavirus macro pull and is currently looking to beat both top and bottom line in upcoming earnings. While the discount retail sector has fared pretty well in current macro conditions, I doubt it’ll continue trending to ATH again.

**Technical**: Priced above 20DMA, below 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming down slightly. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 5.2% or about 8.30$ Short interest is at 1.46%, with 3.9 days to cover. Support at 152$, with all time high being 167.44$

**Sentimental**: Dollar General’s main competitor, Dollar Tree, just had a subpar quarter performance-wise. However, in the last years of earnings, DLTR and DG did not have similar performances in earnings due to DG’s vastly superior store model and trade-war preparation. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak has largely left DG unscathed, while DLTR faced a similar selloff. However, given the current macro outlook, an Iron condor may be a good move, though much riskier. I expect DG to beat earnings and at least inline guidance.

fbekgw_DG,DG,Dollar General (DG),"With the ongoing Coronavirus fear/ market corrections, Dollar General ($DG) may stand out as a huge opportunity come earnings on 3/12, especially after their recent 10% hair-cut:

* **Increased Demand for Consumables** \- 80% of DGs revenues are generated from consumables. In times of uncertainty and panic, such as this virus, consumers will stock up on essential including non-perishable food and consumer goods, which is DG's bread and butter. DG stands to benefit tremendously from this temporary increase in sales and foot traffic.
* **Limited Exposure to Chinese imports -** While DG does import products from China, imports only constitute 6% of all merchandise purchases. Keeping in mind most of their merchandise is Consumables, disruptions in the supply chain will likely only affect their other business lines- Seasonal, Home Products, and Apparel - which together constitute only 20% of overall revenue. Further, the largest category within the non-consumables is Seasonal which is likely going be unaffected since the Coronavirus took off post-Christmas and likely will not impact the all-important Q4 sales. Additionally, in 2018 and 2019, DG stated that tariffs on Chinese goods had no material impact on their business, signifying limited overall exposure.
* **Customer Segmentation** \- DG thrives on low and fixed income individuals and families as their core consumer. While other retailers struggle with the rise of e-commerce and the retail apocalypse, DG has been extremely successful at targeting and growing this segment. They have been largely unaffected by new consumer trends as they focus directly on their core which has been slow to adopt, primarily due to economic, social, and geographic factors. In December 2019, WSJ reported that DG saw 9% overall increase in sales and 4.6% in same-store sales.

e72pnv_DG,DG,Dollar General Dropping After Strong Earnings- Why?,"After DG outperformed earnings expectations and adjusted future outlook up, the stock had a quick 5% bump but has been falling since. Anyone following DG? Here's my theory for what's up, what's your view?

&#x200B;

DG is trading at historically high P/B and P/E ratios, and investors were aware of it, so when the earnings were good (there was a lot of loss to the run up of the earnings call, especially since Dollar Tree tanked on mildly weak earnings) most investors saw a good time to exit and capture their gains. So instead of encouraging new buyers onto the floor, owners saw an opportunity to exit before a more significant correction.

Other than that, I can't understand it. It's still murky because every stock right now is trading at higher than normal P/B & P/B, plus DG does well in market downturns since it's a discount retailer. Investors are anticipating a correction to DG before the larger correction to the market?

Thoughts?",2019-12-06,2,16
e74fiv_DG,DG,Let's talk about $DG,"Firstly, I don't know why this stock isn't more popular here. Seems like most you 'tards ought to be shopping here to begin with.

But let's see what's actually happening. $DLTR made all the headlines because they suck and $DG has unfairly been compared to it. $DG operates in less competitive markets and has much more flexibility with margin. They continue to innovate like putting Western Unions/Telemundo cards in and DG Fresh. It's like a mini Walmart with high margins. And most importantly, they absolutely blew out earnings on every metric. Beat top and bottom line, same store sale growth over 4%, and they announced expanding to open another 2,600 stores. On top of all this, they raised guidance. Yet the stock price hasn't done anything.

On the macro picture, things are great. We saw job numbers blow out expectations. Most importantly, the *types* of jobs are what matters. Data shows that while unemployment is low, the quality of jobs is also low. This is the perfect scenario for a company like $DG. Tons of employed people making low incomes. WTF you think they are going to do?

I have almost 50 contracts riding on this stock and it has never failed me before. Therefore, I'm going to need to rest of you autists to line up and YOLO everything you have into it.

e4mwoe_DG,DG,I may or may not have some very valuable DD for Dollar General (DG),"So I work at DG, asked my boss questions on how the stores are doing. Apparently my store is doing top 100. And we only beat our expectation by like 15%. Everyone else is garbage from what she told me. And she works her ass off to keep the store to maximum profits, those that think every penny counts. Anyway DG is doing better overall for the year but nothing significant to show for. Earnings whisper suggests a cent over expected. Which is the “better overall” fact source. Thats what the bosses are told I guess. 

Anyway, I’m not too sure what guidance means but its not good apparently from what the nerds at investing say about mango man and whatnot. Cuz retail is bad rn? idfk

What I’m mainly looking at, is the fact that out of 15k stores, our store in the top 100 beat by 15% more or less.

So Puts ITM. I’ll throw 1k on it. SHORT DG

I’m 80% sure on this. But if I’m wrong and you lose money just remember that you listened to a random guy on the internet. On the other hand if you win bigly, remember that it was all thanks to a guy on the internet. Good luck

Also this is my first ever DD, so dont hold back

edit: 
I looked something up really quick about their food section. Seems like big brands are cracking down on clover valley stealing their recipes for half off the price. Big brand changes recipe, that forces clover valley to change recipe to avoid lawsuit or something. As of late a ton of bad reviews are coming in complaining to Colver Valley for changing their recipes and that their food taste worse than before. A good example is [Clover Valley: Devils Food](https://clover-valley.pissedconsumer.com/review.html) apparently snackwell was not happy?

3dp6fx_DG,DG,Dollar General? $DG,"So how would I go about researching these guys?  The only thing I can tell you I know, is that near where I live I'm seeing 4 stores being built. I could guess they are aggressively expanding, but is this  just local? Are they doing good financially? Could someone help me understand if this is a good buy?   

I think to have 4 of these stores being open in the region I live is an indication of something good. But my question is, how should I time my entry? I have been watching this stock go up the past few weeks, but would their investment on new ""brick mortar"" stores cause their numbers to go down so there is a dip coming up?
