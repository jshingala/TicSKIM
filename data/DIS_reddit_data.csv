Why it matters:

PwC = Disney’s auditor. Fubo is switching before the deal closes to avoid SEC auditor independence conflicts. You don’t do that unless you believe the deal is real and progressing.

No red flags. KPMG didn’t bounce. There were zero disagreements or “reportable events.” Clean break, clean audit history.
Not opinion shopping. 

Fubo didn’t go to PwC asking for nicer accounting treatment. This is a straight structural move, not a panic hire.
This is the strongest signal yet that the Disney deal is legit and moving. 

Fubo is laying the groundwork now — you don’t pull this kind of legal/accounting trigger unless something big is coming. 🚀

Price Target: $20 within 12–18 months if the deal goes through. That’s a 3–4x from here. Market’s asleep.

Options still dirt cheap. Jan 2026 $10 and $15 calls have low IV. High upside, low cost — the kind of asymmetric setup that prints when the market wakes up. 🚀🚀

1kgw4qh_NET,NET,"Disney reports surprise uptick in streaming subscribers, beats on top and bottom lines","Disney posted fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines, boosted by better-than-expected subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming platform. 

The company upped some of its fiscal 2025 guidance and posted revenue growth in all three of its business segments.

Shares of Disney gained about 6% in premarket trading Wednesday.

Disney, which had previously said it expected Disney+ subscribers to decline during the quarter, reported a 1.4 million increase in subscriptions to its flagship service, bringing its global base to 126 million. Wall Street had expected Disney to report 123.35 million Disney+ subscribers, according to StreetAccount. 

Disney expects a modest rise in these subscribers in its current quarter.

Revenue for its direct-to-consumer business rose to $6.12 billion, up 8% compared with the same period a year prior. Higher prices and increased subscriber numbers led to the growth, the company said.

Here is what Disney reported for the period ended March 29 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.45 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected
* **Revenue:** $23.62 billion vs. $23.14 billion

Disney now expects full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75, an increase of 16% compared with fiscal 2024. Previously, the company said it expected high-single-digit adjusted EPS growth.

Disney’s net income for the most recent quarter increased to $3.28 billion, or $1.81 per share, up from a loss of $20 million, or a loss of 1 cent per share, during the same quarter last year.

Adjusting for one-time items, including the resolution of a tax matter, among other items, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.45. 

Disney’s overall revenue was up 7% year over year to $23.62 billion.

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks, direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 9% year over year to $10.68 billion after a strong carryover from winter film titles.

While “Snow White” and “Captain America: Brave New World” underperformed, ticket sales from 2024 releases “Mufasa: The Lion King” and “Moana 2″ buoyed content sales and licensing. 

Linear continued to drag on overall results, with revenue falling 13% to $2.42 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, rose 5% to $4.53 billion on higher advertising revenue. The company aired three additional College Football Playoff games and one extra National Football League game during the quarter, leading to higher ad rates and viewership.

For fiscal 2025, Disney said Wednesday it expects its sports segment’s operating income growth will be up 18% year over year, higher than the 13% growth it had previously forecast.

Over at its experiences business, which includes parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products, revenue rose 6% during the quarter to $8.89 billion.

Its domestic theme parks saw revenue rise 9% to $6.5 billion, while international park revenues dipped 5% to $1.44 billion.

The company attributed revenue gains to higher guest spend at its domestic parks and higher volumes on its cruise ships following the launch of the Disney Treasure.

Its consumer products division saw revenue up 4% to $949 million due to higher licensing revenue from the newly released video game Marvel Rivals.

1kgvhak_DIS,DIS,"Disney lifts profit outlook after delivering solid parks, streaming results","Disney ([DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)) reported fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, driven by a rebound in its domestic parks business and strong performance in its streaming unit.

The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $5.75 a share, up 16% from fiscal 2024 and roughly double its prior guidance for high single-digit growth. Analysts had expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share to come in at $5.44.

Disney stock jumped as much as 8.5% in early premarket trading before paring gains to rise around 6%.

The report comes as President Trump's [shifting tariff policies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-meets-with-canadas-carney-hints-at-coming-pharma-tariffs-191201378.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) cast a shadow over many companies this earnings season. In its release, the company acknowledged the uncertainty, stating, ""We continue to monitor macroeconomic developments for potential impacts to our businesses and recognize that uncertainty remains regarding the operating environment for the balance of the fiscal year.""

# Streaming surprise

Disney+ added 1.4 million subscribers in the quarter, a beat compared to the 1.25 million subscriber loss analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. The company reported a drop of 700,000 paying users in Q1 as a result of expected user churn [from recent price hikes.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-joins-peacock-max-and-others-in-raising-prices-heres-what-it-means-for-your-subscription-costs-135639309.html)

In the midst of those price increases, along with other initiatives like password sharing crackdowns, the company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming unit, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted a profit of $336 million. That's up from $47 million one year ago and also ahead of analyst expectations.

It marked the fourth straight quarter of profitability for the streaming business.

The company has a streaming profit target of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025.

Overall, revenue of $23.62 billion beat expectations of $23.05 billion in the quarter and represented a 7% increase from the prior-year period.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 came in ahead of the $1.20 expected by analysts polled by Bloomberg. Earnings increased 20% from a year ago.

# Domestic parks soar as international lags

Disney's parks business faces continued pressure from broader economic uncertainties and intensifying competition, [particularly with the upcoming launch of NBCUniversal's Epic Universe](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-cfo-comfortable-with-theme-park-price-hikes-warns-of-negative-impact-from-universals-epic-universe-214247010.html), which could draw visitors away from Disney’s Florida attractions.

But that didn't weigh on domestic profits in the second quarter.

The company posted a 13% rise in operating income at its domestic parks, aided by an uptick in theme park attendance and [the successful launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-is-all-in-on-cruise-ships-heres-why-investors-should-care-110003516.html)This was a stark rebound compared to the 5% decline in domestic operating income [the company reported in Q1.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-price-hikes-help-fuel-earnings-growth-as-streaming-business-posts-profit-144131406.html)

Disney also saw an increase in guest spending at the parks, bucking fears of a [consumer and tourism pullback in the US](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-tale-of-2-consumers-high-earners-doing-fine-while-lower-income-households-under-some-pressure-100009997.html). This was offset by the higher costs needed to expand the cruise line, with two more ships set to launch later this year.

But international parks disappointed amid greater macroeconomic pressures. The segment posted a significant 23% drop in operating income, driven by lower theme park attendance and increased costs at Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.

Heading into the report, Needham analyst Laura Martin said she was most interested in attendance at Disney’s Shanghai and Hong Kong parks, viewing it as a proxy for the global strength of the US brand.

Disney previously said it expects 6% to 8% operating income growth in its parks segment for fiscal year 2025, with expectations for stronger performance in the latter half of the year.

Notably, the company said it took a $109 million content impairment charge in the quarter. It reported a roughly $50 million charge in Q1 [due to its Venu Sports joint venture exit ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venu-sports--the-proposed-sports-streaming-venture-between-espn-fox-and-warner-bros--is-no-more-150011767.html)earlier in the year.

1jcu80x_DE,DE,Nintendo Analysis (NTDOT): Disney of the Gaming World?,"Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Pokemon — the list of Nintendo’s iconic franchises is remarkable, rivaled only by Disney’s portfolio of beloved brands.

What Disney’s brands are to movies and television, Nintendo is to gaming. The above franchises, among others, have been as enduring and culturally impactful as any Disney character, particularly for avid gamers.

Impressively, Nintendo has found ways to continuously invigorate these franchises. With Pokemon, for example, the viral launch of the app-based game Pokemon Go helped expose a new generation to the 1990s-era franchise, bringing the game to an innovative and new mobile format.

Just as an FYI — I try to breakdown a different company every week with 30-40 hours of research, and I like to share my findings here

**Nintendo: Leaving Cyclicality Behind**

I must admit—my days as a gamer are long behind me, and I think the same goes for Shawn. But Nintendo still holds a special place in my heart. As a kid, I spent hundreds of hours playing Pokémon on my Nintendo DS and just slightly less guiding a Lego Darth Vader through the Death Star on my Nintendo Wii.

And I know I’m not the only one with these memories. Nintendo has built one of the largest player bases in the world—selling 146 million units of its most recent console, the Switch, and boasting nearly 130 million active players—a testament to its enduring appeal.

But despite this lasting appeal, Nintendo’s financial growth couldn't follow the same straight upward path. Its business model has long been tied to console cycles—with revenues and profits surging in the early years of a new console as margins expand and growth accelerates, especially compared to the late-stage weakness of the previous cycle. But inevitably, every cycle peaks, leading to falling revenues, profits, and margins.

**The Nintendo Switch Cycle**

The Nintendo Switch Cycle illustrates how this dynamic works. One year after its launch in March of 2017, revenues more than doubled, rising from $4.4 billion to almost $10 billion. Operating margins nearly tripled, climbing from 6% to 16.8%.

Until the peak in 2021, Nintendo enjoyed a four-year upward cycle with average revenue growth of 17%. At its high point, revenues hit $15.9 billion, operating income reached $5.8 billion, and operating margins soared to 36.4%.

Now, you might argue that there hasn’t been a significant downturn until FY2025. And you’d be right. While the Switch cycle followed the typical growth pattern, it hasn’t experienced the usual steep decline.

So why has this cycle been different, and what does that mean for the future of Nintendo’s business?

Nintendo’s competition — Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox — began transforming their business models years ago. The Xbox 360 was the first console to put online play behind a paywall through a service called Xbox Live Gold. PlayStation followed suit with PS Plus when the PlayStation 4 launched.

This marked a major shift in the industry. Recurring subscription revenues helped offset the cyclical nature of the console business. Additionally, most consoles historically sold at a loss. PlayStation and Xbox were rumored to lose between $100 and $200 on each console sold. While the PS5 has been sold at break-even prices since late 2021, subscription revenues helped to make up for console losses quicker than before the business model switch.

Nintendo never sold their consoles at a loss. That may explain why Nintendo didn’t immediately jump on the subscription bandwagon. While Sony and Microsoft were launching the PS4 and Xbox One, Nintendo released the Wii U—the biggest failure in the company’s history. The Wii U sold just 13 million units—a far cry from its predecessor, the Wii (which sold over 100 million), and its successor, the Switch (now at 146 million).

The failure of the Wii U proved that Nintendo’s business model needed a shift as well. And the Switch delivered. You could say it was Nintendo’s Xbox Live Gold moment—the turning point where Nintendo began to rethink its revenue strategy and embrace a more modern, sustainable model.

**The New Business Model - Nintendo’s Flywheel**

Nintendo’s new business model is built around an ecosystem that retains its player base across console generations—significantly increasing a player’s lifetime value. At the same time, Nintendo is shifting toward higher software sales and more third-party game support with the launch of the Switch 2.

Historically, Nintendo has been the king of physical sales. But in recent years, software sales have gained ground, now making up closer to 50% of total sales—a notable shift toward a more balanced revenue mix.

Regarding third-party games, the Wii U offered only 600 third-party titles—a consequence of many studios abandoning the platform due to its poor sales performance. In contrast, the Switch has amassed a library of over 11,000 third-party games. However, these are mostly smaller indie titles—so-called Single-A or Double-A games—rather than major franchises like Call of Duty (COD) or Grand Theft Auto (GTA).

The Switch 2 is set to close the performance gap with competing consoles. Powered by a new Nvidia chip, it will match the PS4 Pro’s capabilities—making it possible to run high-end, blockbuster games previously limited to PlayStation and Xbox. If it delivers, Nintendo could significantly expand its audience.

These blockbuster games offer greater upsell potential through DLC (Downloadable Content) and in-game purchases, such as character skins. Nintendo benefits from these sales, taking a 30% cut of each transaction without incurring any costs.

While increasing software sales and introducing higher-quality third-party games will naturally improve margins, another key objective is to drive subscriptions to Nintendo Switch Online (NSO). A larger subscriber base would further boost margins and reduce cyclicality.

Currently, Nintendo Switch Online has “only” 34 million subscribers. I say “only” because Nintendo has 130 million active players—meaning there’s significant room for growth. For comparison, PlayStation reported 47.4 million PS Plus subscribers in 2023 on a comparable-sized player base.

Nintendo should be able to reach similar, if not higher, subscription numbers. No other company—except perhaps Disney—commands an IP portfolio as strong as Nintendo’s, which includes Mario, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and many more.

Nintendo has begun leveraging this IP more effectively, taking a page from Disney’s flywheel model. The 2023 Super Mario Bros. Movie drew 170 million viewers and generated $1.36 billion. Soon after, Super Mario Bros. Wonder became the fastest-selling Mario game, with 4.3 million units sold in two weeks.

Mario-themed attractions at Universal Studios in Japan and the US have also been major hits, showing Nintendo’s growing ability to capitalize on its IP.

Now, what does this mean for Nintendo’s valuation?

**Valuing Nintendo**

Nintendo is in the midst of a transition—making it difficult to value. I’ll walk you through my assumptions so you can see if they make sense to you. If you want to explore different assumptions, you can download my valuation model at the end to adjust it yourself. (I also recommend clicking to read the web version of my analysis [here](https://intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com/p/ntdoy), where I can more easily show charts and graphics that get excluded on Reddit.)

Given the uncertainty, I’ve chosen conservative assumptions, including ongoing cyclicality. I'm forecasting an eight-year period, consistent with the Switch 1 cycle.

The Switch 1 benefited from the tailwind of a weak predecessor. Many players never upgraded from the Wii, likely driving stronger demand than today. That’s why I don’t expect a similar 120% revenue increase after the Switch 2 launch. Instead, I’m projecting a 60% increase over the remainder of 2025 (assuming a launch in H2 2025) and 2026.

From 2027 to 2029, I forecast an average annual growth rate of 15%—slightly lower than the Switch 1 cycle—since the technological leap is smaller and cross-gen gameplay could reduce upgrade urgency. The last three years mark the Switch 2 downcycle, during which I expect annual revenue declines of 10%.

This is the most bearish assumption of my valuation. If you want to adjust for a more optimistic, and perhaps realistic, outlook, you could modify the assumptions here—for instance, by projecting flat revenues or even further growth.

Unlike revenue, I expect margins to improve beyond 2029 due to higher software and in-game sales.

I still remain conservative, though, assuming an average annual increase of just 2% over the eight-year period, resulting in operating margins of 43% in 2032. This is well below most bullish estimates. If the thesis I’ve outlined here—and in more detail on our podcast episode—plays out, margins could grow beyond 50%.

However, it’s still unclear how well blockbuster games will run on the Switch 2 or how effectively Nintendo will drive NSO subscriptions using its IP. I’d rather be cautious with a company trading at a P/E of 40—though this reflects the Switch 1 cycle ending, which lowers earnings, and excitement for the Switch 2, which drives demand for Nintendo stock. The normalized P/E is closer to 30.

Based on these assumptions, my model values Nintendo at $77 per share. When we recorded the podcast, this was almost exactly where the stock traded. However, Nintendo has corrected by about 10% in the last two weeks, now standing at $69 (based on the Japanese listing converted to USD).

This price decrease makes Nintendo already a more compelling opportunity. But beyond that, the long-term opportunity is better than it appears at first glance.

First, while uncertainties remain, I believe the thesis outlined today has a much higher chance of succeeding than failing. Beyond that, my model suggests the market still isn’t pricing in Nintendo’s business transformation—it’s focused solely on a successful Switch 2 launch. That could give long-term investors a chance to buy after the initial hype fades and benefit from Nintendo’s broader business improvements.

**Portfolio Decision**

I’m inclined to add Nintendo to my Portfolio, but the value investor in me is still cautious. Further short-term headwinds are possible after the Switch 2 release since investors already expect success, which limits the upside. Even if the release should be a success. The market also hasn’t priced in Nintendo’s business transformation, which could lead to selling pressure from those betting on a quick win—a pattern seen with past launches.

If that happens, it could create an opportunity to buy at a lower price with greater certainty once the Switch 2’s success becomes clearer.

At a price in the low $60s, I’d be comfortable starting a position in Nintendo. Waiting for the release carries the risk of missing some upside—but that’s a risk I’m willing to take. And who knows—maybe the market will give us a shot at this phenomenal business sooner than expected.

1jcu80x_PATH,PATH,Nintendo Analysis (NTDOT): Disney of the Gaming World?,"Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Pokemon — the list of Nintendo’s iconic franchises is remarkable, rivaled only by Disney’s portfolio of beloved brands.

What Disney’s brands are to movies and television, Nintendo is to gaming. The above franchises, among others, have been as enduring and culturally impactful as any Disney character, particularly for avid gamers.

Impressively, Nintendo has found ways to continuously invigorate these franchises. With Pokemon, for example, the viral launch of the app-based game Pokemon Go helped expose a new generation to the 1990s-era franchise, bringing the game to an innovative and new mobile format.

Just as an FYI — I try to breakdown a different company every week with 30-40 hours of research, and I like to share my findings here

**Nintendo: Leaving Cyclicality Behind**

I must admit—my days as a gamer are long behind me, and I think the same goes for Shawn. But Nintendo still holds a special place in my heart. As a kid, I spent hundreds of hours playing Pokémon on my Nintendo DS and just slightly less guiding a Lego Darth Vader through the Death Star on my Nintendo Wii.

And I know I’m not the only one with these memories. Nintendo has built one of the largest player bases in the world—selling 146 million units of its most recent console, the Switch, and boasting nearly 130 million active players—a testament to its enduring appeal.

But despite this lasting appeal, Nintendo’s financial growth couldn't follow the same straight upward path. Its business model has long been tied to console cycles—with revenues and profits surging in the early years of a new console as margins expand and growth accelerates, especially compared to the late-stage weakness of the previous cycle. But inevitably, every cycle peaks, leading to falling revenues, profits, and margins.

**The Nintendo Switch Cycle**

The Nintendo Switch Cycle illustrates how this dynamic works. One year after its launch in March of 2017, revenues more than doubled, rising from $4.4 billion to almost $10 billion. Operating margins nearly tripled, climbing from 6% to 16.8%.

Until the peak in 2021, Nintendo enjoyed a four-year upward cycle with average revenue growth of 17%. At its high point, revenues hit $15.9 billion, operating income reached $5.8 billion, and operating margins soared to 36.4%.

Now, you might argue that there hasn’t been a significant downturn until FY2025. And you’d be right. While the Switch cycle followed the typical growth pattern, it hasn’t experienced the usual steep decline.

So why has this cycle been different, and what does that mean for the future of Nintendo’s business?

Nintendo’s competition — Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox — began transforming their business models years ago. The Xbox 360 was the first console to put online play behind a paywall through a service called Xbox Live Gold. PlayStation followed suit with PS Plus when the PlayStation 4 launched.

This marked a major shift in the industry. Recurring subscription revenues helped offset the cyclical nature of the console business. Additionally, most consoles historically sold at a loss. PlayStation and Xbox were rumored to lose between $100 and $200 on each console sold. While the PS5 has been sold at break-even prices since late 2021, subscription revenues helped to make up for console losses quicker than before the business model switch.

Nintendo never sold their consoles at a loss. That may explain why Nintendo didn’t immediately jump on the subscription bandwagon. While Sony and Microsoft were launching the PS4 and Xbox One, Nintendo released the Wii U—the biggest failure in the company’s history. The Wii U sold just 13 million units—a far cry from its predecessor, the Wii (which sold over 100 million), and its successor, the Switch (now at 146 million).

The failure of the Wii U proved that Nintendo’s business model needed a shift as well. And the Switch delivered. You could say it was Nintendo’s Xbox Live Gold moment—the turning point where Nintendo began to rethink its revenue strategy and embrace a more modern, sustainable model.

**The New Business Model - Nintendo’s Flywheel**

Nintendo’s new business model is built around an ecosystem that retains its player base across console generations—significantly increasing a player’s lifetime value. At the same time, Nintendo is shifting toward higher software sales and more third-party game support with the launch of the Switch 2.

Historically, Nintendo has been the king of physical sales. But in recent years, software sales have gained ground, now making up closer to 50% of total sales—a notable shift toward a more balanced revenue mix.

Regarding third-party games, the Wii U offered only 600 third-party titles—a consequence of many studios abandoning the platform due to its poor sales performance. In contrast, the Switch has amassed a library of over 11,000 third-party games. However, these are mostly smaller indie titles—so-called Single-A or Double-A games—rather than major franchises like Call of Duty (COD) or Grand Theft Auto (GTA).

The Switch 2 is set to close the performance gap with competing consoles. Powered by a new Nvidia chip, it will match the PS4 Pro’s capabilities—making it possible to run high-end, blockbuster games previously limited to PlayStation and Xbox. If it delivers, Nintendo could significantly expand its audience.

These blockbuster games offer greater upsell potential through DLC (Downloadable Content) and in-game purchases, such as character skins. Nintendo benefits from these sales, taking a 30% cut of each transaction without incurring any costs.

While increasing software sales and introducing higher-quality third-party games will naturally improve margins, another key objective is to drive subscriptions to Nintendo Switch Online (NSO). A larger subscriber base would further boost margins and reduce cyclicality.

Currently, Nintendo Switch Online has “only” 34 million subscribers. I say “only” because Nintendo has 130 million active players—meaning there’s significant room for growth. For comparison, PlayStation reported 47.4 million PS Plus subscribers in 2023 on a comparable-sized player base.

Nintendo should be able to reach similar, if not higher, subscription numbers. No other company—except perhaps Disney—commands an IP portfolio as strong as Nintendo’s, which includes Mario, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and many more.

Nintendo has begun leveraging this IP more effectively, taking a page from Disney’s flywheel model. The 2023 Super Mario Bros. Movie drew 170 million viewers and generated $1.36 billion. Soon after, Super Mario Bros. Wonder became the fastest-selling Mario game, with 4.3 million units sold in two weeks.

Mario-themed attractions at Universal Studios in Japan and the US have also been major hits, showing Nintendo’s growing ability to capitalize on its IP.

Now, what does this mean for Nintendo’s valuation?

**Valuing Nintendo**

Nintendo is in the midst of a transition—making it difficult to value. I’ll walk you through my assumptions so you can see if they make sense to you. If you want to explore different assumptions, you can download my valuation model at the end to adjust it yourself. (I also recommend clicking to read the web version of my analysis [here](https://intrinsicvalue.beehiiv.com/p/ntdoy), where I can more easily show charts and graphics that get excluded on Reddit.)

Given the uncertainty, I’ve chosen conservative assumptions, including ongoing cyclicality. I'm forecasting an eight-year period, consistent with the Switch 1 cycle.

The Switch 1 benefited from the tailwind of a weak predecessor. Many players never upgraded from the Wii, likely driving stronger demand than today. That’s why I don’t expect a similar 120% revenue increase after the Switch 2 launch. Instead, I’m projecting a 60% increase over the remainder of 2025 (assuming a launch in H2 2025) and 2026.

From 2027 to 2029, I forecast an average annual growth rate of 15%—slightly lower than the Switch 1 cycle—since the technological leap is smaller and cross-gen gameplay could reduce upgrade urgency. The last three years mark the Switch 2 downcycle, during which I expect annual revenue declines of 10%.

This is the most bearish assumption of my valuation. If you want to adjust for a more optimistic, and perhaps realistic, outlook, you could modify the assumptions here—for instance, by projecting flat revenues or even further growth.

Unlike revenue, I expect margins to improve beyond 2029 due to higher software and in-game sales.

I still remain conservative, though, assuming an average annual increase of just 2% over the eight-year period, resulting in operating margins of 43% in 2032. This is well below most bullish estimates. If the thesis I’ve outlined here—and in more detail on our podcast episode—plays out, margins could grow beyond 50%.

However, it’s still unclear how well blockbuster games will run on the Switch 2 or how effectively Nintendo will drive NSO subscriptions using its IP. I’d rather be cautious with a company trading at a P/E of 40—though this reflects the Switch 1 cycle ending, which lowers earnings, and excitement for the Switch 2, which drives demand for Nintendo stock. The normalized P/E is closer to 30.

Based on these assumptions, my model values Nintendo at $77 per share. When we recorded the podcast, this was almost exactly where the stock traded. However, Nintendo has corrected by about 10% in the last two weeks, now standing at $69 (based on the Japanese listing converted to USD).

This price decrease makes Nintendo already a more compelling opportunity. But beyond that, the long-term opportunity is better than it appears at first glance.

1ip2mrz_SNOW,SNOW,Disney $dis is on the mend.,"About 1.5 years ago I started to add more Disney.

Back then my rationale was that an investment in Disney was a bet on Bob Iger’s leadership. And he had 4 years to bring earnings back to pre-Covid’s $5 to 6+ per share (depending on average). The share price, if he were successful could be $150 (pre-covid peak) or around $200 in 2001.

(in 2001 streaming had peak members but most of them were poor quality $1 a month cricket sports subscribers from South Asia , conveniently lumped together to make the nos look good).

Well, fast forward 18 months later, Disney’s is on the mend, the fy 2024 (sept 30) was $4.97 (adjusted eps) and ttm (last’s week results) was $5.5 (adjusted EPS).

Iger’s contract ends on Dec 2026. I would expect him to declare Disney’s turnaround a success later this year or next year. And for him to appoint his successor to run the reinvigorated Disney

**The thing is, it is still not expensive to buy Disney.**

Here are the nos:

At the current price of $110, the implied growth is around 5-6% a year.

Current analysts estimates of growth are around 10-12% CAGR for the next 3- 5 years.

I used a more conservative 9% to get a fair value  of 125 to 160. Morningstar and CFRA puts the fair value between 125 to 127.

**Risks to my thesis**: well in 2024 Disney was helped by Moana 2, Deadpool and inside out 2. If the new Captain  America or the upcoming Snow White doesn’t appeal to audiences, then maybe the turnaround will run its full course to FY 2026 Sept 30.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market. But ongoing claims, which track those still looking for work, have been creeping up, and economists are watching closely for any cracks in hiring trends.

On the earnings front, it’s a packed day with updates from Eli Lilly ($LLY), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY), AstraZeneca ($AZN), Kellanova ($K), Yum Brands ($YUM), Cloudflare ($NET), Roblox ($RBLX), Under Armour ($UA), Pinterest ($PINS), Affirm ($AFRM), Honeywell ($HON), Peloton ($PTON), Hershey ($HSY), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), and Skechers ($SKX).

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** has mastered the art of blending gaming and social media, making it a favorite among the middle school elite. The platform has nailed monetization while keeping safety a priority, fueling a stock surge over the past year. But with its valuation climbing, some investors may hesitate—though Wall Street sees plenty of room for growth if it continues dominating the digital playground. Consensus: -$0.45 EPS, $1.37 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Amazon** faces challenges from all angles—AI could shake up its cloud empire, and tariffs might dent its e-commerce machine. But size matters, and Amazon’s scale gives it a serious edge. With a booming ad business, top-tier margins, and industry-leading efficiency, it’s no surprise that nearly every analyst calls it a buy. Consensus: $1.49 EPS, $187.25 billion in revenue.

1iij1tm_DIS,DIS,When to sell Disney?,"I'm a newer investor, and I've got a problem. I don't know what to do with stock that's lost money and been sitting in my account for a decade.

I bought shares of Disney in 2015. The new Star Wars movies were going to come out and I figured how could I go wrong with IP like this!? (Did I say I'm a newer investor?)

Now I'm actually trying to learn how to invest. I'm seeing DIS sitting in my Fidelity account, with -8.16% on it, and wondering if it's time to just throw in the towel, sell the stock, and put that money to better use. It's not a lot of money (I've only got 10 shares) but surely I could make up for my losses rather quickly by selling and buying something else, right?

What's the right value investor response to this?",2025-02-05,3,25

2. The LA fires fucked up the real estate market in the LA area since a ton of displaced people need places to stay. There will be less AirBNB inventory and higher prices all around for vacation rentals and hotels due to the fires. This will impact their Disneyland park attendances.

1hx0ytb_DE,DE,Disney says about 157 million global users are streaming content with ads,"Disney said Wednesday it has an estimated 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

That number includes 112 million users domestically and is an average per month over the last six months.

While traditional TV outlets have a standard way of measuring ratings and viewership, there is still no industry standard methodology for measuring global streaming advertising audience size.

The company said that its Disney Advertising unit has “set out to define a globally consistent approach and methodology to estimate ad-supported audience numbers.” It’s providing the update and further insight into its ad-supported streaming business during the annual CES tech conference in Las Vegas, a go-to event for the advertising and media industry.

“Disney sits at the intersection of world class sports and entertainment content, with the most high-value audiences in ad-supported global streaming at scale,” said Rita Ferro, Disney’s president of global advertising, in a news release. “We wanted to be the first to offer our industry greater transparency into the methodology used to estimate our engaged global ad-supported monthly active users.”

In explaining the methodology, the company said the metric is derived from active accounts across Disney’s three streaming services that have viewed ad-supported shows and movies continuously for more than 10 seconds. “Each active account is then multiplied by the number of estimated users per account ... to estimate the total number of users,” it said. The estimated active users are added across the apps without de-duplication, meaning users who subscribe to more than one of the platforms could be counted more than once.

Growth in ad-supported tiers

Media companies have become particularly focused on generating profits from their streaming businesses, and advertising has become a key way to do that. While many platforms were initially subscription services without commercials, streaming platforms in recent years have introduced cheaper, ad-supported tiers for consumers.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that the company is trying to steer its customers toward its ad-supported tiers. The company has raised prices on commercial-free options since launching Disney+ with ads in late 2022.

Disney’s Hulu was one of the first streaming platforms to offer an ad-supported option. More recently, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier.

In November, Disney said it had 122.7 million Disney+ Core subscribers, which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region. Hulu had 52 million subscribers, while ESPN+ had 25.6 million paid subscribers.

The company historically hasn’t reported exactly how many subscribers on each platform pay for the ad-supported option, but executives in the earnings call in November said more than half of new U.S. Disney+ subscribers were choosing the cheaper, ad-supported tier, adding this “bodes well for the future.”

Disney noted during the call that average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, due to a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Executives also said in November that they were confident streaming would “be a significant growth area” for the company.

At the time, the company reported that its combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, posted operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period the year prior.

Disney will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Feb. 5 before the bell.

Over the past few months, I’ve grown increasingly bullish on Disney’s future. While the stock hasn’t shown much movement over the last decade, the company has been doing everything right to set itself up for long-term growth. With a market cap sitting around $200 billion on $92 billion in annual revenue, Disney’s valuation feels disconnected from its progress. Since 2015, the company’s revenue has more than doubled, yet its market cap is roughly the same (200 billion).

# Strength in Content and Streaming

In my experience, Netflix often feels like it’s missing something when it comes to content. Disney, HBO, and Hulu consistently deliver shows and movies I actually want to watch. Disney, in particular, has an edge with Marvel, National Geographic, Star Wars, Pixar, 21st century Fox, ETC.

Disney has started bundling with HBO in certain packages, creating an offering that feels far superior to Netflix. Even so, Netflix’s market cap is nearly twice Disney’s, despite Disney rapidly growing its subscriber base. With its dominance in family-friendly content, especially during key times like the holidays, Disney is primed to keep adding users. For instance, they leaned hard into promoting their holiday classics over Christmas, likely driving a solid bump in subscribers this quarter.

# New Experiences and Expanding Horizons

Disney is also doubling down on experiences. Their cruise lines are already a huge draw for families, and they’re not slowing down. Over the next six years, they plan to launch a new cruise ship every year, expanding their footprint in the vacation market. Add to that their private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay, and I personally am looking on taking my family on a Disney cruise.

# Sports Streaming and Strategic Acquisitions

Sports are another big opportunity for Disney. Their recent 70% acquisition of FuboTV is a smart play, setting the stage for their new sports streaming service, Venu. Combining this with their existing ESPN+ platform, Disney is carving out a strong position in the live sports market. This is a smart move in a space that’s still underserved compared to traditional entertainment streaming.

# Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Disney feels like it’s finally turning the corner. Between its content, innovative experiences, and strategic acquisitions, the company has a lot going for it. By 2030, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Disney’s market cap exceed $600 billion. Here’s why:

1. Streaming: Disney+ is on track to challenge Netflix in subscriber numbers, especially with its strong family-friendly focus.
2. Experiences: Cruises, theme parks, and new attractions like Bluey are drawing in more families and boosting revenue.
3. Sports: With Venu and ESPN+, Disney is poised to dominate sports streaming.
4. Diversification: Their wide range of franchises and properties gives Disney a steady pipeline of opportunities to grow.

A big reason Disneys stock has not grown for so long was due to the impact of COVID on move goers and on Disney experiences. Movies are back: The new Deadpool was the highest R rated movie of all time at nearly 1.4 billion in revenue, Inside out 2 became the highest grossing animated film ever at nearly 1.7 billion, and Moana 2 will also break the billion mark. That is: 3 of the 4 highest grossing movies of 2024 are from Disney. And Disney has many more exiting movies in the pipeline. These films typically give a bump to their streaming services, which I expect to be the case with Films like the manadlorian and the bluey film

Now is the perfect time to buy this stock IMO. The stock hasn't yet recovered from covid, but will this year.

While Disney is not directly related to NVIDIA’s core business, the positive earnings could:


	1.	Boost Investor Sentiment: A strong NVDA earnings report often lifts the overall market, particularly indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy ETFs (QQQ). This could create a rising tide effect for Disney’s stock as part of the broader market.


	2.	Stimulate Risk-On Behavior: If NVIDIA’s performance beats estimates, it may encourage investors to shift into equities, potentially benefiting consumer-oriented companies like Disney.


	3.	Sector Rotation: If tech rallies, it could spill over into growth and entertainment stocks, especially if Disney’s valuation is seen as favorable.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

1gr51ur_DIS,DIS,Disney rises more than 10% premarket as company's fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted EPS tops estimates,"Disney's fiscal fourth-quarter revenue was $22.57 billion, up 6.3% year-over-year, compared with estimates of $22.47 billion. Fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.14, compared with estimates of $1.10. Disney was up nearly 1% premarket.

In its Q4 2024 earnings report, Disney showed good financial performance, beating market expectations. The company reported revenues of $22.574 billion, up 6.3% from $21.241 billion in the same period last year. Briefly it reached $460 million or $0.25 in first half earnings compared to $264 million or $0.14 in the same period last year. Adjusted first half earnings were $1.14 and I expected $0.95

Disney's performance varied across its businesses. Revenue from entertainment content was significant, particularly in streaming and linear TV. disney+ and Hulu also saw growth in subscribers, which helped drive revenue growth in the division. That said, challenges remain in certain areas, such as the performance of the parks business, which has been impacted in part by macroeconomic factors

Looking ahead, Disney expects to deliver high single-digit and two-digit annual adjusted earnings growth, respectively, between 2025 and 2027. This signals optimism about the company's long-term outlook, particularly in terms of cost containment and business alignment

These results reflect Disney's continued investment in its streaming business as well as its strategic realignment in its traditional entertainment business. In addition, the company has presented optimistic financial expectations for the next few years, signs that are already pointing to a good performance for Disney in the near future

1gr3mpb_DIS,DIS,Disney narrowly beats estimates as streaming boosts entertainment segment,"Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG

Earnings per share: $1.14 adjusted vs. $1.10 expected

Revenue: $22.57 billion vs. $22.45 billion expected

Disney’s net income increased to $460 million, or 25 cents per share, from $264 million, or 14 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring and impairment charges, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.14. 

Total segment operating income increased 23% to $3.66 billion compared with the same period in 2023.  

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks,  direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 14% year over year to $10.83 billion after a hot summer at the box office.

Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time this summer, surpassing Disney’s “Frozen II” at the box office. Meanwhile, its “Deadpool & Wolverine” became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, surpassing Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Joker.”

The films added $316 million of profit for the entertainment segment during the quarter. Overall, the entertainment segment reported nearly $1.1 billion in profit.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN’s profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, saw profitability improve during the quarter after turning its first profit during the fiscal third quarter, three months earlier than expected. The division reported an operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. 

Disney joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. 

Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. 

Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Meanwhile the company’s traditional TV networks business continued to decline as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. 

The experiences segment, which includes Disney’s theme parks as well as consumer products, saw revenue grow 1% to $8.24 billion. 

The domestic parks’ operating income rose 5% to $847 million, helped by higher guest spending at the parks and cruise lines. 

Operating income at the international parks, however, fell 32% due to a decline in attendance and in guest spending as well as increased costs. 

The company said Thursday it’s “confident in the long-term prospects for the business,” and provided an outlook that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Disney expects a “modest decline” in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter.

Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared to the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double digit percentage in its fiscal 2026.

Disney also anticipates double-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 for its entertainment segment.

The experience segment, however, is expected to see just 6% to 8% profit growth in the coming fiscal year compared to the prior year. Disney noted the fiscal first quarter will see a $130 million hit due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as a $90 million impact from Disney Cruise Line pre-launch costs.

During Disney’s fiscal 2025, the company expects high-single digit adjusted earnings growth compared to the prior fiscal year. The company expects double digit adjusted EPS growth in both fiscal 2026 and 2027.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500? 

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That’s a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman’s David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market. 

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it’s tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight – Oh My!**  
So where’s the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years—giving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that’s all about the big boys. 

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too—they tend to do well when the market’s top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman’s Gloom**  
Goldman’s not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade. 

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you’ve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the “analysts” think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to win—you just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger’s retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger’s successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again. 

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn’t ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates—both internal and external. But with Iger’s direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences’ Josh D’Amaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney’s had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?). 

Now, with Gorman steering the board’s succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman’s experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who’s stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman’s outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney’s board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who’s Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney’s top job, and they’ve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D’Amaro, who oversees Disney’s theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites. 

He’s got a solid public profile and is leading the company’s $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there’s Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN’s sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who’s deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there’s always a wildcard—an outside candidate waiting to swoop in. 

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500? 

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That’s a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman’s David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market. 

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it’s tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight – Oh My!**  
So where’s the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years—giving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that’s all about the big boys. 

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too—they tend to do well when the market’s top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman’s Gloom**  
Goldman’s not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade. 

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you’ve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the “analysts” think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to win—you just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger’s retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger’s successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again. 

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn’t ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates—both internal and external. But with Iger’s direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences’ Josh D’Amaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500? 

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That’s a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman’s David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market. 

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it’s tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight – Oh My!**  
So where’s the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years—giving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that’s all about the big boys. 

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too—they tend to do well when the market’s top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman’s Gloom**  
Goldman’s not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade. 

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you’ve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the “analysts” think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to win—you just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger’s retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger’s successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again. 

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn’t ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates—both internal and external. But with Iger’s direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences’ Josh D’Amaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney’s had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?). 

Now, with Gorman steering the board’s succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman’s experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who’s stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman’s outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney’s board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who’s Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney’s top job, and they’ve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D’Amaro, who oversees Disney’s theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites. 

He’s got a solid public profile and is leading the company’s $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there’s Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN’s sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who’s deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there’s always a wildcard—an outside candidate waiting to swoop in. 

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

But the worst performer has, for obvious reasons, been DIS. The account has 750 shares with a cost basis of $114.

I've got to believe they'll eventually rebound, but that seems far off in the future. My gut says that unless they somehow miraculously rebounded within the next year, I'd get better gains by just selling DIS and moving to a fidelity index, like FXAIX or something. 

The bottom line being that I don't want to withdrawal from this account until I have to. I'm taking out more than the minimum each year to fund my own IRA and my wife's, but otherwise I'm trying not to touch this since it's 10 years of tax free gains.

# Worst Month for Stocks: September

Ah, September—the month when Halloween decorations start creeping onto store shelves, and if you’re a stock market investor, a time when your portfolio might give you a scare. Historically, September has been a nightmare for Wall Street, and 2024 is shaping up to be just as spooky.

# A Historical Downer

Let’s get straight to the point: September tends to suck for stocks. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) dips 1.51%, the S&P 500 ($SPX) drops 2.12%, the Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) falls 3.26%, and the Russell 2000 ($RUT) slides 3.09%. And these numbers aren't just random blips—they reflect over a century of data. It’s like Groundhog Day, but instead of six more weeks of winter, you get a month of losses.

If that wasn’t enough to make you want to close your brokerage account and head for the hills, bond investors don’t fare much better. The iShares U.S. Treasury bond ETF ($GOVT), which tracks the broad U.S. government bond market, typically has its worst month in September too. This is the part where you cue the sad trombone.

# So, Why the Gloom?

Why does September get such a bad rap? Analysts have a few theories. After a summer of sand and sun, traders return to their desks and start to reassess their portfolios, which often means selling off high-fliers. Plus, companies begin thinking about their year-end financials, making it a prime time to offload some winners to balance out the losers. It’s like a spring cleaning—only, you know, in the fall.

But it’s not all bad news. Stocks actually finished August strong, buoyed by surprisingly robust economic data that calmed fears about a faltering job market. And with the Federal Reserve likely to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years at their next meeting on September 18, there’s a sliver of hope that things could turn around.

Adding to the uncertainty, the August jobs report is due out on September 6. If it disappoints, we could see another selloff like we did last month when the July numbers came in lower than expected.

And let’s not forget about the looming presidential election and the ongoing tension in the Middle East, which could escalate into a full-blown conflict involving major oil producers like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

# The Bright Side?

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that gold and the U.S. dollar—two traditional safe havens—have historically performed better in September. So, while stocks might be in for a rough ride, there are still places to park your money if you’re feeling scared.

# Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? 

DirecTV subscribers might want to double-check their TV listings this week because ESPN, Disney, ABC, and a host of other channels just vanished. Yep, you read that right—Disney pulled its programming from DirecTV, including streaming services like Hulu, due to a contract dispute.

# What Happened?

The blackout happened at a pretty inconvenient time for sports fans. With the new college football season in full swing and the U.S. Open tennis tournament heating up, DirecTV viewers were left hanging. ESPN cut out during fourth-round U.S. Open matches at 7:20 p.m. ET, and just minutes before a big football game between LSU and USC. Needless to say, fans were not happy, flooding social media with complaints.

DirecTV is the third-largest pay TV provider in the U.S., with 11.3 million customers who suddenly have a lot less to watch. The main sticking point? Carriage fees—the amount DirecTV pays Disney to carry its channels. DirecTV wants more flexibility in choosing which channels to offer its customers, while Disney is pushing for a bundled approach that would keep all their channels together, which typically costs subscribers more.

# Why the Blackout?

At its core, this dispute is about money—surprise, surprise. DirecTV argues that Disney is being anti-consumer by insisting on bundled packages that drive up costs. For example, ESPN's monthly fee has jumped to about $10, up 40% from $7.19 in 2019. DirecTV’s CFO, Ray Carpenter, claims customers are tired of these ""bloated packages"" that force them to pay for channels they don’t watch. Disney, on the other hand, says it’s not going to sign any deals that undervalue its content.

# When Will This End?

Unfortunately, no one knows when the channels will be back. Blackouts like these can last anywhere from a few days to several years, depending on how quickly both parties can reach an agreement. DirecTV is giving its customers a $20 credit as a consolation, but that’s cold comfort for sports fans missing out on their favorite games.

# What Can You Do?

If you’re a DirecTV subscriber missing out on Disney’s channels, you have some options. You could switch to a streaming service like YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV, both of which offer Disney’s full lineup. Just be prepared to shell out between $73 and $80 a month, depending on the service.

In the meantime, keep your fingers crossed that Disney and DirecTV can sort this out before the next big game or episode of your favorite show.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is packed with key labor market data, starting with tomorrow's release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS report provides a snapshot of the previous month’s job openings, hires, and separations (like layoffs and retirements) across the U.S. It's a critical indicator of labor market health, especially the job openings figure, which sheds light on the demand for workers.

The previous JOLTS data showed little change, with job openings at 8.18 million—down by 941,000 from a year ago—while the job openings rate held steady at 4.9%. For the upcoming report, economists expect the number of job openings to be slightly lower, around 8.09 million, which isn't expected to cause much concern in the markets.

* **Dollar Tree ($DLTR)**, on the other hand, has faced a challenging year, struggling amid high inflation that has particularly affected lower-income consumers. However, with inflation easing and potential rate cuts on the horizon, the outlook might brighten for both the company and its customers.

# Worst Month for Stocks: September

Ah, September—the month when Halloween decorations start creeping onto store shelves, and if you’re a stock market investor, a time when your portfolio might give you a scare. Historically, September has been a nightmare for Wall Street, and 2024 is shaping up to be just as spooky.

# A Historical Downer

Let’s get straight to the point: September tends to suck for stocks. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) dips 1.51%, the S&P 500 ($SPX) drops 2.12%, the Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) falls 3.26%, and the Russell 2000 ($RUT) slides 3.09%. And these numbers aren't just random blips—they reflect over a century of data. It’s like Groundhog Day, but instead of six more weeks of winter, you get a month of losses.

If that wasn’t enough to make you want to close your brokerage account and head for the hills, bond investors don’t fare much better. The iShares U.S. Treasury bond ETF ($GOVT), which tracks the broad U.S. government bond market, typically has its worst month in September too. This is the part where you cue the sad trombone.

# So, Why the Gloom?

Why does September get such a bad rap? Analysts have a few theories. After a summer of sand and sun, traders return to their desks and start to reassess their portfolios, which often means selling off high-fliers. Plus, companies begin thinking about their year-end financials, making it a prime time to offload some winners to balance out the losers. It’s like a spring cleaning—only, you know, in the fall.

But it’s not all bad news. Stocks actually finished August strong, buoyed by surprisingly robust economic data that calmed fears about a faltering job market. And with the Federal Reserve likely to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years at their next meeting on September 18, there’s a sliver of hope that things could turn around.

Adding to the uncertainty, the August jobs report is due out on September 6. If it disappoints, we could see another selloff like we did last month when the July numbers came in lower than expected.

And let’s not forget about the looming presidential election and the ongoing tension in the Middle East, which could escalate into a full-blown conflict involving major oil producers like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

# The Bright Side?

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that gold and the U.S. dollar—two traditional safe havens—have historically performed better in September. So, while stocks might be in for a rough ride, there are still places to park your money if you’re feeling scared.

# Market Movements

* Intel’s Potential Dow Jones Exit: Intel ($INTC) faces the possibility of being removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to a nearly 60% drop in its stock price this year, making it the index's worst performer.
* ByteDance Pursues Massive Loan: TikTok owner ByteDance is seeking a $9.5 billion loan with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan as coordinators. The loan includes a 3-year term, extendable to 5 years, and will partially refinance an existing $5 billion loan.
* Amazon Strengthens AI Robotics: Amazon ($AMZN) has hired the founders of AI robotics startup Covariant, along with a portion of its employees, and secured a license to use its AI technology for robotic operations.

* Illumina Wins Legal Battle: Illumina won its court battle against the European Union’s investigation of its $7.1 billion Grail acquisition, with the court ruling that the European Commission overstepped its authority.
* Volkswagen Considers Factory Closures: Volkswagen is contemplating closing factories in Germany for the first time in its history due to profitability challenges and increasing competition from Asian competitors.

# Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? 

DirecTV subscribers might want to double-check their TV listings this week because ESPN, Disney, ABC, and a host of other channels just vanished. Yep, you read that right—Disney pulled its programming from DirecTV, including streaming services like Hulu, due to a contract dispute.

# What Happened?

The blackout happened at a pretty inconvenient time for sports fans. With the new college football season in full swing and the U.S. Open tennis tournament heating up, DirecTV viewers were left hanging. ESPN cut out during fourth-round U.S. Open matches at 7:20 p.m. ET, and just minutes before a big football game between LSU and USC. Needless to say, fans were not happy, flooding social media with complaints.

DirecTV is the third-largest pay TV provider in the U.S., with 11.3 million customers who suddenly have a lot less to watch. The main sticking point? Carriage fees—the amount DirecTV pays Disney to carry its channels. DirecTV wants more flexibility in choosing which channels to offer its customers, while Disney is pushing for a bundled approach that would keep all their channels together, which typically costs subscribers more.

# Why the Blackout?

At its core, this dispute is about money—surprise, surprise. DirecTV argues that Disney is being anti-consumer by insisting on bundled packages that drive up costs. For example, ESPN's monthly fee has jumped to about $10, up 40% from $7.19 in 2019. DirecTV’s CFO, Ray Carpenter, claims customers are tired of these ""bloated packages"" that force them to pay for channels they don’t watch. Disney, on the other hand, says it’s not going to sign any deals that undervalue its content.

# When Will This End?

Unfortunately, no one knows when the channels will be back. Blackouts like these can last anywhere from a few days to several years, depending on how quickly both parties can reach an agreement. DirecTV is giving its customers a $20 credit as a consolation, but that’s cold comfort for sports fans missing out on their favorite games.

# What Can You Do?

If you’re a DirecTV subscriber missing out on Disney’s channels, you have some options. You could switch to a streaming service like YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV, both of which offer Disney’s full lineup. Just be prepared to shell out between $73 and $80 a month, depending on the service.

In the meantime, keep your fingers crossed that Disney and DirecTV can sort this out before the next big game or episode of your favorite show.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is packed with key labor market data, starting with tomorrow's release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS report provides a snapshot of the previous month’s job openings, hires, and separations (like layoffs and retirements) across the U.S. It's a critical indicator of labor market health, especially the job openings figure, which sheds light on the demand for workers.

The previous JOLTS data showed little change, with job openings at 8.18 million—down by 941,000 from a year ago—while the job openings rate held steady at 4.9%. For the upcoming report, economists expect the number of job openings to be slightly lower, around 8.09 million, which isn't expected to cause much concern in the markets.

* **Dollar Tree ($DLTR)**, on the other hand, has faced a challenging year, struggling amid high inflation that has particularly affected lower-income consumers. However, with inflation easing and potential rate cuts on the horizon, the outlook might brighten for both the company and its customers. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, noting the stock has significant upside, with the average price target suggesting a 55% increase from current levels.

* Stocks kicked off September on a sour note, suffering their worst day since the market sell-off in early August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1.51%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 tumbled 2.12%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite bore the brunt of the sell-off, dropping 3.26%, dragged down by a sharp decline in technology and semiconductor stocks like Nvidia.
* This downturn was fueled by fresh economic data that rekindled fears of a slowing economy, with key indicators such as the ISM purchasing managers' index and construction spending showing unexpected declines.
* The market's poor performance reflects a renewed wave of anxiety over economic growth and the health of the labor market, amplified by expectations of upcoming economic reports. 



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

# Worst Month for Stocks: September

Ah, September—the month when Halloween decorations start creeping onto store shelves, and if you’re a stock market investor, a time when your portfolio might give you a scare. Historically, September has been a nightmare for Wall Street, and 2024 is shaping up to be just as spooky.

# A Historical Downer

Let’s get straight to the point: September tends to suck for stocks. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) dips 1.51%, the S&P 500 ($SPX) drops 2.12%, the Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) falls 3.26%, and the Russell 2000 ($RUT) slides 3.09%. And these numbers aren't just random blips—they reflect over a century of data. It’s like Groundhog Day, but instead of six more weeks of winter, you get a month of losses.

If that wasn’t enough to make you want to close your brokerage account and head for the hills, bond investors don’t fare much better. The iShares U.S. Treasury bond ETF ($GOVT), which tracks the broad U.S. government bond market, typically has its worst month in September too. This is the part where you cue the sad trombone.

# So, Why the Gloom?

Why does September get such a bad rap? Analysts have a few theories. After a summer of sand and sun, traders return to their desks and start to reassess their portfolios, which often means selling off high-fliers. Plus, companies begin thinking about their year-end financials, making it a prime time to offload some winners to balance out the losers. It’s like a spring cleaning—only, you know, in the fall.

But it’s not all bad news. Stocks actually finished August strong, buoyed by surprisingly robust economic data that calmed fears about a faltering job market. And with the Federal Reserve likely to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years at their next meeting on September 18, there’s a sliver of hope that things could turn around.

Adding to the uncertainty, the August jobs report is due out on September 6. If it disappoints, we could see another selloff like we did last month when the July numbers came in lower than expected.

And let’s not forget about the looming presidential election and the ongoing tension in the Middle East, which could escalate into a full-blown conflict involving major oil producers like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

# The Bright Side?

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that gold and the U.S. dollar—two traditional safe havens—have historically performed better in September. So, while stocks might be in for a rough ride, there are still places to park your money if you’re feeling scared.

# Market Movements

* Intel’s Potential Dow Jones Exit: Intel ($INTC) faces the possibility of being removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to a nearly 60% drop in its stock price this year, making it the index's worst performer.
* ByteDance Pursues Massive Loan: TikTok owner ByteDance is seeking a $9.5 billion loan with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan as coordinators. The loan includes a 3-year term, extendable to 5 years, and will partially refinance an existing $5 billion loan.
* Amazon Strengthens AI Robotics: Amazon ($AMZN) has hired the founders of AI robotics startup Covariant, along with a portion of its employees, and secured a license to use its AI technology for robotic operations. This strategic move allows Amazon to enhance its warehouse robotics capabilities without a full acquisition.
* Illumina Wins Legal Battle: Illumina won its court battle against the European Union’s investigation of its $7.1 billion Grail acquisition, with the court ruling that the European Commission overstepped its authority.
* Volkswagen Considers Factory Closures: Volkswagen is contemplating closing factories in Germany for the first time in its history due to profitability challenges and increasing competition from Asian competitors.
* Intel’s New Processor Launch: Intel ($INTC) launched its second-generation Core Ultra 200V processors, aiming to improve battery life and performance to better compete with Qualcomm and AMD in the laptop market. The new chips boast significant power efficiency and enhanced AI capabilities, positioning Intel to regain market share against its rivals.
* Nokia’s New Contract with AT&T: Nokia signed a 5-year deal with AT&T to build a fiber network in the U.S.after losing a major telecom network contract to Ericsson.

# Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? 

DirecTV subscribers might want to double-check their TV listings this week because ESPN, Disney, ABC, and a host of other channels just vanished. Yep, you read that right—Disney pulled its programming from DirecTV, including streaming services like Hulu, due to a contract dispute.

# What Happened?

The blackout happened at a pretty inconvenient time for sports fans. With the new college football season in full swing and the U.S. Open tennis tournament heating up, DirecTV viewers were left hanging. ESPN cut out during fourth-round U.S. Open matches at 7:20 p.m. ET, and just minutes before a big football game between LSU and USC. Needless to say, fans were not happy, flooding social media with complaints.

DirecTV is the third-largest pay TV provider in the U.S., with 11.3 million customers who suddenly have a lot less to watch. The main sticking point? Carriage fees—the amount DirecTV pays Disney to carry its channels. DirecTV wants more flexibility in choosing which channels to offer its customers, while Disney is pushing for a bundled approach that would keep all their channels together, which typically costs subscribers more.

# Why the Blackout?

At its core, this dispute is about money—surprise, surprise. DirecTV argues that Disney is being anti-consumer by insisting on bundled packages that drive up costs. For example, ESPN's monthly fee has jumped to about $10, up 40% from $7.19 in 2019. DirecTV’s CFO, Ray Carpenter, claims customers are tired of these ""bloated packages"" that force them to pay for channels they don’t watch. Disney, on the other hand, says it’s not going to sign any deals that undervalue its content.

# When Will This End?

Unfortunately, no one knows when the channels will be back. Blackouts like these can last anywhere from a few days to several years, depending on how quickly both parties can reach an agreement. DirecTV is giving its customers a $20 credit as a consolation, but that’s cold comfort for sports fans missing out on their favorite games.

# What Can You Do?

If you’re a DirecTV subscriber missing out on Disney’s channels, you have some options. You could switch to a streaming service like YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV, both of which offer Disney’s full lineup. Just be prepared to shell out between $73 and $80 a month, depending on the service.

In the meantime, keep your fingers crossed that Disney and DirecTV can sort this out before the next big game or episode of your favorite show.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is packed with key labor market data, starting with tomorrow's release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS report provides a snapshot of the previous month’s job openings, hires, and separations (like layoffs and retirements) across the U.S. It's a critical indicator of labor market health, especially the job openings figure, which sheds light on the demand for workers.

The previous JOLTS data showed little change, with job openings at 8.18 million—down by 941,000 from a year ago—while the job openings rate held steady at 4.9%. For the upcoming report, economists expect the number of job openings to be slightly lower, around 8.09 million, which isn't expected to cause much concern in the markets.

1et9bvh_DIS,DIS,"Apparently, Nelson Peltz/Trian still has some or at least few Disney stocks left. How does this whole thing work?","Towards the end of May 2024, it was reported that Nelson Peltz sold all of his Disney stocks:

> **Nelson Peltz Reportedly Sold All of His Disney Stock, Earning $1 Billion, After Losing Proxy Fight**
> 
> Nelson Peltz cashed out his shares of Disney shortly after the activist investor lost his bid to win seats on the Mouse House’s board, according to a CNBC report Wednesday.
> 
> Peltz sold all of his Disney stock at “close to $120 dollars a share,” making about $1 billion on the sale, CNBC reported, citing an anonymous source. That would indicate that Peltz sold the shares in the days immediately after the April 3 Disney shareholder meeting — where his bid to shake up Disney’s board was soundly defeated.
> 
> A rep for Trian Partners, the hedge fund headed by Peltz, declined to comment. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
> 
> At the April 3 virtual meeting of Disney shareholders, investors voted to reelect the current 12-member board of directors by a substantial margin over the candidates nominated by Trian — Peltz himself and ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo — and a smaller investment firm, Blackwells Capital.
> 
> Peltz, in an appearance on CNBC April 4, had threatened to resume his activist agenda at Disney if the company and CEO Bob Iger did not keep their “promises.”
> 
> “I hope this is not a redo of last year where we pulled out, gave management a chance and the stock went down,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview. He added, “Whether we stay [invested in Disney] or not, we don’t make those kinds of announcements.”
> 
> Peltz’s Trian had at one time controlled 32.3 million shares of Disney, including about 30 million owned by former Marvel Entertainment head Ike Perlmutter. (Disney alleged Perlmutter harbored a longstanding personal vendetta against Iger.) At the end of 2023, Trian’s stake represented 1.8% of Disney’s outstanding shares.
> 
> In his proxy fight, one of Peltz’s biggest complaints was his allegation that Disney’s board failed to do its job with CEO succession planning in not vetting former parks boss Bob Chapek, who was Iger’s personal pick to take over the job in 2020. “They all took Bob’s word, and they voted Chapek in. That’s not what the responsibility of a director is,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview last month. The board ousted Chapek in November 2022 and brought Iger back on as CEO.
> 
> In an appearance earlier on CNBC on April 4, Iger reiterated that the Disney board’s top priority is the CEO succession and he said “they’re treating it with urgency.” He also said Disney’s long-term goal is to hit double-digit margins in the streaming business, which was another key point in Trian’s proxy campaign.

> No serious person thinks Peltz is or would be a creative director. His function and proven ability is taking a low share price and turning it into a high one. In this context, in this sub, in this situation, with this company, at this time, share price is the most and only relevant thing.
> 
> The economy isn’t “kind of down right now”. That’s a right ing talking point echoed by extreme conserves and financial media talking heads. By any objective measure, the lowest unemployment in 75 years, 2.2% inflation, massive job creation, domestic manufacturing, energy independence, infrastructure, technology, software, wage and benefit increases, rising union influence, and numerous other non-emotional metrics say the economy is super strong. It’s just that lazy reporters have been bamboozled into asking people “isn’t the economy so bad” to the point where people figure it has to be true.
> 
> Agree that Perlmutter is an undesirable element of the Peltz offer from the perspective of the existing board and executives.
But, again, their opinion on anything business-related should probably be dismissed based on their proven track record of creating the worst stock in the Dow for the last decade-plus.

> If you want to discuss who or what would be good/bad for disney’s creative element, or disney’s culture or whatever, then I’m sure you have excellent points regarding Peltz/Perlmutter etc

We’re still growing jobs not shrinking, inflation is still very low, Dow is 40k, we still have the best economy in the galaxy.

1eqvy64_DIS,DIS,Walt Disney (DIS) Looking for Bottom on $60B Theme Park Expansion,"Walt Disney (DIS) unveiled exciting new plans for its theme park expansions at the D23 Expo in Orlando, aiming to revitalize its Entertainment segment after a challenging Q3 FY2024. 

The company announced significant expansions at Walt Disney World, including a new villains-themed land and a section dedicated to the popular Cars franchise. 

Additionally, Animal Kingdom will introduce rides based on Indiana Jones and Encanto, while Hollywood Studios will develop a new area inspired by Monsters, Inc., featuring a suspended roller coaster.

These ambitious projects are part of Disney’s broader strategy to invest $60 billion over the next decade to expand and update its parks. While these developments are promising, they are long-term solutions that will take years to materialize and boost demand.

Disney's Q3 results highlighted the need for this revitalization. Operating income in the Entertainment segment fell by 3% to $2.2 billion, and the company expects a further decline in Q4, largely due to a slowdown in domestic theme park demand. 

This downturn in domestic leisure travel is impacting Disney's theme park business, alongside increasing competition from Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) and Comcast's (CMCSA) Universal Studios.",2024-08-13,10,10

# Buffett's Treasury Holdings Surpass the Federal Reserve

# Buffett’s New Side Gig: Competing with the Fed

Warren Buffett’s latest power move? Outdoing the Federal Reserve at its own game. Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK) has now amassed more short-term U.S. Treasurys than the Fed itself, holding a whopping $234.6 billion in T-bills by the end of June. That’s an 81% leap from the $130 billion they had stashed away at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the Fed is lagging behind with a mere $195.3 billion in these government-backed IOUs.

So, why is Buffett—normally the stock market's biggest cheerleader—piling into Treasurys? The short answer: guaranteed returns. With yields hovering over 5%, Berkshire is set to pocket a cool $12 billion in annual interest, all while dodging state and local taxes. It's the ultimate “risk-free” investment for a guy who’s seen it all.

# The Oracle Goes All-In on Safety

But this isn’t just about earning some easy cash. Buffett’s massive T-bill stash suggests he’s not seeing many juicy opportunities in the stock market right now. In fact, Berkshire has been offloading stocks for seven straight quarters, including a big slice of its Apple ($AAPL) holdings. This has some Buffett-watchers wondering: Is the Oracle of Omaha turning bearish on the U.S. economy?

Or maybe, just maybe, Buffett’s biding his time for something big. The man has a history of pouncing on market dips with massive acquisitions, and with a cash reserve like this, he’s ready to strike when the iron's hot.

# Sitting on a Pile of Cash

Whether he’s waiting for the next big buying opportunity or simply playing it safe, one thing’s clear: Buffett’s in no rush. With T-bills offering over 5% returns, he’s making money while he waits. And given the current economic jitters and stock market rollercoaster, who can blame him?

So, while the Fed might be scaling back its holdings, Buffett’s cash fortress is growing. And as usual, when Buffett makes a move, the rest of us can’t help but wonder what’s coming next.

# Earnings Highlights

# Reddit Rides the AI Wave

Reddit is cashing in big time. In just its second earnings report since going public in March, the social media forum crushed Wall Street’s expectations. Q2 revenue soared 54% year-over-year, hitting $281 million and easily outpacing the predicted $254 million. The star of the show? Reddit’s AI data licensing business, which catapulted its “other revenue” segment up a staggering 691% to $28.1 million. Not bad for a company that’s still getting its sea legs as a public entity.

# Robinhood Rides the Meme-Stock Wave

Robinhood is riding high on the latest meme-stock mania. The trading platform smashed Wall Street’s expectations in its Q2 earnings report, with revenue hitting $682 million—well above the anticipated $643 million. The big driver? A surge in meme-stock and crypto trading, which pushed transaction-based revenue up by 69% to $327 million. Not bad for a company that’s been navigating choppy waters since its IPO.

# Novo Nordisk’s Weighty Problem 

Novo Nordisk had a rough day. The Danish pharma powerhouse saw its stock tumble 8.27% after missing the mark on earnings from its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company posted a Q2 net profit of $1.86 billion—a 3% year-over-year increase—both drug sales came in below analyst expectations. Wegovy raked in $1.7 billion, falling short of the $2 billion forecast, and Ozempic sales also missed by $0.2 billion. Investors weren’t thrilled with the slimmer-than-expected numbers.



# Disney’s Streaming Magic Soars, but the Parks Hit a Speed Bump

# By the Numbers: Disney's Q3

* **$23.16 billion**: Total revenue, beating the $23.07 billion estimate.
* **$1.39**: Earnings per share, topping the expected $1.19.
* **$47 million**: Profit from combined streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+).
* **6%**: Decline in U.S. parks’ operating income.
* **4%**: Overall revenue growth year-over-year.

# Streaming Triumph

Disney ($DIS) just scored a major win, beating Wall Street’s expectations for its third-quarter earnings. The highlight? Disney’s combined streaming services—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—finally turned a profit, hitting this milestone a quarter earlier than predicted. With a $47 million operating profit compared to a $512 million loss last year, the entertainment giant’s pivot towards streaming is paying off big time.

CEO Bob Iger was quick to celebrate this success, especially since Disney's entertainment division has been weighed down by streaming losses for years. The turnaround is also thanks to hits like Pixar’s *Inside Out 2*, which helped Disney’s film studio break a losing streak.

# Parks Cool Down

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Disney’s theme parks, long the company’s profit engines, are facing some headwinds. Inflation and flat attendance at U.S. parks put a damper on earnings, leading to a 6% dip in operating income for domestic parks. The company isn’t expecting a quick rebound, forecasting a mid-single-digit profit drop in the upcoming quarter.

Despite the parks’ slowdown, Disney’s overall revenue still grew by 4% to $23.2 billion, topping the $23.1 billion analysts expected. And while the parks might be struggling, Disney is banking on its entertainment and streaming divisions to carry the load moving forward.

# Looking Ahead

To keep the streaming momentum going, Disney is hiking subscription prices, with increases up to 25% for its online video services. As for the parks, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, despite the current slump. Disney is also navigating a potential $5 billion bill to acquire Comcast’s stake in Hulu, with a final decision expected in 2025.

Overall, it’s a mixed bag for Disney: streaming is shining bright, while the parks could use a little magic.

# Buffett's Treasury Holdings Surpass the Federal Reserve

# Buffett’s New Side Gig: Competing with the Fed

Warren Buffett’s latest power move? Outdoing the Federal Reserve at its own game. Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK) has now amassed more short-term U.S. Treasurys than the Fed itself, holding a whopping $234.6 billion in T-bills by the end of June. That’s an 81% leap from the $130 billion they had stashed away at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the Fed is lagging behind with a mere $195.3 billion in these government-backed IOUs.

So, why is Buffett—normally the stock market's biggest cheerleader—piling into Treasurys? The short answer: guaranteed returns. With yields hovering over 5%, Berkshire is set to pocket a cool $12 billion in annual interest, all while dodging state and local taxes. It's the ultimate “risk-free” investment for a guy who’s seen it all.

# The Oracle Goes All-In on Safety

But this isn’t just about earning some easy cash. Buffett’s massive T-bill stash suggests he’s not seeing many juicy opportunities in the stock market right now. In fact, Berkshire has been offloading stocks for seven straight quarters, including a big slice of its Apple ($AAPL) holdings. This has some Buffett-watchers wondering: Is the Oracle of Omaha turning bearish on the U.S. economy?

Or maybe, just maybe, Buffett’s biding his time for something big. The man has a history of pouncing on market dips with massive acquisitions, and with a cash reserve like this, he’s ready to strike when the iron's hot.

# Sitting on a Pile of Cash

Whether he’s waiting for the next big buying opportunity or simply playing it safe, one thing’s clear: Buffett’s in no rush. With T-bills offering over 5% returns, he’s making money while he waits. And given the current economic jitters and stock market rollercoaster, who can blame him?

So, while the Fed might be scaling back its holdings, Buffett’s cash fortress is growing. And as usual, when Buffett makes a move, the rest of us can’t help but wonder what’s coming next.

# Earnings Highlights

# Reddit Rides the AI Wave

Reddit is cashing in big time. In just its second earnings report since going public in March, the social media forum crushed Wall Street’s expectations. Q2 revenue soared 54% year-over-year, hitting $281 million and easily outpacing the predicted $254 million. The star of the show? Reddit’s AI data licensing business, which catapulted its “other revenue” segment up a staggering 691% to $28.1 million. Not bad for a company that’s still getting its sea legs as a public entity.

# Robinhood Rides the Meme-Stock Wave

Robinhood is riding high on the latest meme-stock mania. The trading platform smashed Wall Street’s expectations in its Q2 earnings report, with revenue hitting $682 million—well above the anticipated $643 million. The big driver? A surge in meme-stock and crypto trading, which pushed transaction-based revenue up by 69% to $327 million. Not bad for a company that’s been navigating choppy waters since its IPO.

# Novo Nordisk’s Weighty Problem 

Novo Nordisk had a rough day. The Danish pharma powerhouse saw its stock tumble 8.27% after missing the mark on earnings from its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company posted a Q2 net profit of $1.86 billion—a 3% year-over-year increase—both drug sales came in below analyst expectations. Wegovy raked in $1.7 billion, falling short of the $2 billion forecast, and Ozempic sales also missed by $0.2 billion. Investors weren’t thrilled with the slimmer-than-expected numbers.



# Disney’s Streaming Magic Soars, but the Parks Hit a Speed Bump

# By the Numbers: Disney's Q3

* **$23.16 billion**: Total revenue, beating the $23.07 billion estimate.
* **$1.39**: Earnings per share, topping the expected $1.19.
* **$47 million**: Profit from combined streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+).
* **6%**: Decline in U.S. parks’ operating income.
* **4%**: Overall revenue growth year-over-year.

# Streaming Triumph

Disney ($DIS) just scored a major win, beating Wall Street’s expectations for its third-quarter earnings. The highlight? Disney’s combined streaming services—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—finally turned a profit, hitting this milestone a quarter earlier than predicted. With a $47 million operating profit compared to a $512 million loss last year, the entertainment giant’s pivot towards streaming is paying off big time.

CEO Bob Iger was quick to celebrate this success, especially since Disney's entertainment division has been weighed down by streaming losses for years. The turnaround is also thanks to hits like Pixar’s *Inside Out 2*, which helped Disney’s film studio break a losing streak.

# Parks Cool Down

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Disney’s theme parks, long the company’s profit engines, are facing some headwinds. Inflation and flat attendance at U.S. parks put a damper on earnings, leading to a 6% dip in operating income for domestic parks. The company isn’t expecting a quick rebound, forecasting a mid-single-digit profit drop in the upcoming quarter.

Despite the parks’ slowdown, Disney’s overall revenue still grew by 4% to $23.2 billion, topping the $23.1 billion analysts expected. And while the parks might be struggling, Disney is banking on its entertainment and streaming divisions to carry the load moving forward.

# Looking Ahead

To keep the streaming momentum going, Disney is hiking subscription prices, with increases up to 25% for its online video services. As for the parks, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, despite the current slump. Disney is also navigating a potential $5 billion bill to acquire Comcast’s stake in Hulu, with a final decision expected in 2025.

Overall, it’s a mixed bag for Disney: streaming is shining bright, while the parks could use a little magic.

# Tomorrow

Every Thursday, the US Department of Labor drops its initial jobless claims report, a snapshot of how many folks filed for unemployment benefits the week before. Normally, it’s a routine release that doesn’t cause much of a stir. But in today’s jittery market, it’s taken on new significance. Last Friday, a disappointing jobs report triggered a stock market sell-off, with investors fearing the labor market is cooling off quicker than the Fed anticipated. Tomorrow’s report could either fan those flames or bring some much-needed relief to nervous traders.

Novo Nordisk had a rough day. The Danish pharma powerhouse saw its stock tumble 8.27% after missing the mark on earnings from its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company posted a Q2 net profit of $1.86 billion—a 3% year-over-year increase—both drug sales came in below analyst expectations. Wegovy raked in $1.7 billion, falling short of the $2 billion forecast, and Ozempic sales also missed by $0.2 billion. Investors weren’t thrilled with the slimmer-than-expected numbers.



# Disney’s Streaming Magic Soars, but the Parks Hit a Speed Bump

# By the Numbers: Disney's Q3

* **$23.16 billion**: Total revenue, beating the $23.07 billion estimate.
* **$1.39**: Earnings per share, topping the expected $1.19.
* **$47 million**: Profit from combined streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+).
* **6%**: Decline in U.S. parks’ operating income.
* **4%**: Overall revenue growth year-over-year.

# Streaming Triumph

Disney ($DIS) just scored a major win, beating Wall Street’s expectations for its third-quarter earnings. The highlight? Disney’s combined streaming services—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—finally turned a profit, hitting this milestone a quarter earlier than predicted. With a $47 million operating profit compared to a $512 million loss last year, the entertainment giant’s pivot towards streaming is paying off big time.

CEO Bob Iger was quick to celebrate this success, especially since Disney's entertainment division has been weighed down by streaming losses for years. The turnaround is also thanks to hits like Pixar’s *Inside Out 2*, which helped Disney’s film studio break a losing streak.

# Parks Cool Down

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Disney’s theme parks, long the company’s profit engines, are facing some headwinds. Inflation and flat attendance at U.S. parks put a damper on earnings, leading to a 6% dip in operating income for domestic parks. The company isn’t expecting a quick rebound, forecasting a mid-single-digit profit drop in the upcoming quarter.

Despite the parks’ slowdown, Disney’s overall revenue still grew by 4% to $23.2 billion, topping the $23.1 billion analysts expected. And while the parks might be struggling, Disney is banking on its entertainment and streaming divisions to carry the load moving forward.

# Looking Ahead

To keep the streaming momentum going, Disney is hiking subscription prices, with increases up to 25% for its online video services. As for the parks, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, despite the current slump. Disney is also navigating a potential $5 billion bill to acquire Comcast’s stake in Hulu, with a final decision expected in 2025.

Overall, it’s a mixed bag for Disney: streaming is shining bright, while the parks could use a little magic.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Every Thursday, the US Department of Labor drops its initial jobless claims report, a snapshot of how many folks filed for unemployment benefits the week before. Normally, it’s a routine release that doesn’t cause much of a stir. But in today’s jittery market, it’s taken on new significance. Last Friday, a disappointing jobs report triggered a stock market sell-off, with investors fearing the labor market is cooling off quicker than the Fed anticipated. Tomorrow’s report could either fan those flames or bring some much-needed relief to nervous traders.

**Thursday:** Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

# Before Market Open:

* **Eli Lilly ($LLY)**: Riding high on the success of Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly is the toast of the obesity drug market right now. The stock’s sky-high valuations reflect investor confidence, but they’ll need to see the company deliver the goods with a solid profit boost to justify the optimism. Wall Street is mostly bullish—15 out of 18 analysts say buy—but it’s all eyes on earnings. Consensus: $2.70 EPS, $9.95 billion in revenue.
* **Yeti ($YETI)**: Remember when Yeti coolers were the must-have post-pandemic accessory? Those days may be fading, but the brand isn’t backing down. After a tough year of slipping shares, Yeti is shifting its focus to international markets. Investors are looking for proof that this strategy will pay off, especially with stronger margins translating to better profits. Consensus: $0.63 EPS, $452.29 million in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Sweetgreen ($SG)**: Sweetgreen is surfing multiple waves right now—value-conscious consumers tired of fast food and a broader shift towards healthier eating. The stock has surged over 144% in 2024, with analysts predicting even more upside. But that optimism hinges on Sweetgreen’s ability to keep delivering strong results, especially with the company’s push into automated restaurants. Consensus: -$0.10 EPS, $180.91 million in revenue.
* **e.l.f. Beauty ($ELF)**: Since its 2016 IPO, e.l.f. Beauty has built a loyal following with its affordable, high-quality cosmetics and savvy social media game. But with inflation pressuring consumer wallets, the big question is whether e.l.f. can sustain its growth. Investors are watching closely to see if the company can continue to thrive in a tougher economic climate. Consensus: $0.85 EPS, $301.44 million in revenue.",2024-08-08,3,2

Yesterday Disney announced great results, but the market didn’t like that parks had a slow down and the stock was sold off. 

Here is an interview with the cfo on the matter:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqPdRP_wx4


A year ago, I wrote in here that to invest in Disney is to invest in Bob Iger’s leadership to turn around the business. 

And the simplest way of valuing dis in now is to see if Disney can achieve the earnings it made pre-pandemic in 2019 before all the mess started. And see if it can turnaround before Bob Iger’s contract ends on Dec 2026.


In 2019 (end sep), Disney had EPS of $6.5 and the stock price was around $150. 

In the most recent quarter, Disney earned $1.39. In the next 4 quarters, I expect Disney to earn at least 1.39x4 or $5.56 in 2025. So getting to 2019 nos of $6.5 by 2026 is quite achievable.

 ( CFRA march estimates for 2025 is $5.5) 

So, if Disney can achieve 2026 eps of $6.5, then it isn’t unreasonable to expect the share price to reach between the 2019 highs of $150 to the 2021 Bob Chapek’s honeymoon period highs of $200.

So, a range of 66% to 100% returns for the next 2.5 years. (Excluding dividends etc)

Disney is like the girlfriend that everybody got jilted on and now that she is back in town, investors are finding excuses not to go after her again. 

- lousy movies
- too woke
- Not enough focus on creatives
- Lousy leadership

1em8wk5_DIS,DIS,Disney beats estimates as combined streaming services turn a profit ,"Disney reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings Wednesday, topping analyst estimates as its combined streaming businesses turned a profit earlier than expected.

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.19 expected

Revenue: $23.16 billion vs. $23.07 billion expected

The company’s total segment operating income increased 19% to $4.225 billion compared with the same period last year, led by the positive results for Disney’s entertainment unit, particularly streaming. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which consists of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, together turned a profit for the first time — and it happened a quarter earlier than the company had expected.

The combined streaming business posted an operating profit of $47 million compared with a loss of $512 million in the same quarter last year. However, without ESPN+, the direct-to-consumer streaming unit reported a loss of $19 million.

Meanwhile, last quarter, Disney+ and Hulu together turned a profit, but when combined with ESPN+, the streaming businesses suffered a loss.

Disney recently changed how it reports its segments, with ESPN falling under its sports unit, and Disney+ and Hulu being counted as part of the direct-to-consumer entertainment segment. Disney and its peers have been focused on streaming reaching profitability as the traditional TV business bleeds customers.

Disney+ Core subscribers — which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region — increased by 1% to 118.3 million, despite the company’s earlier guidance it wouldn’t add new customers during the fiscal third quarter. Total Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 51.1 million.

Revenue for the entertainment segment was up 4% to $10.58 billion, driven largely by subscription revenue growth due to price increases and customer growth for Disney+ Core. The company announced further streaming price hikes on Tuesday. Revenue for the traditional TV networks was down 7%.

Disney’s overall revenue increased 4% to $23.155 billion compared with the same period last year.

However, while Disney’s entertainment and sports divisions drove earnings, the U.S. theme parks business was impacted by slowing consumer demand and inflation.

“The portfolio is working well,” Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said. “Yes there was softness in the domestic parks, but the entertainment division’s profit tripled in the quarter.” 

Disney’s parks have been a key profit driver, and the company has pledged to spend roughly $60 billion on its theme parks over the next decade.

Revenue for the overall experiences unit, which includes domestic and international parks and experiences, as well as consumer products, was up 2% to $8.386 billion. 

Operating income for U.S. parks was down 6%, while international parks operating income was up 2%. The company attributed the decrease in operating income at the domestic parks to higher costs driven by inflation, as well as increased technology spending and new guest offerings.

This carried over from the previous quarter, when Disneyland Resort in California was under pressure with lower profits, with executives citing similar reasons.

Last month Comcast’s earnings were weighed down by its Universal theme parks, which the company attributed to increased competition from cruises and international tourism. Despite this, Comcast executives said they remained “bullish” on the business, especially with a new theme park opening in 2025.

1duqpbi_DIS,DIS,$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity,"This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.

https://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c

$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. 

The dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   
Whenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.

Notice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.

Since the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.

Once price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.

This is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.

Now I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.

ENTRY :  
Now, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  
You will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.

Right now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.

Personally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..

TARGET :  
If the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.

The December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  
If the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  
I like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.

Keep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.

Good luck regards.

1d8y6qp_DE,DE,Disney set to invest $17 billion in Florida parks months after settlement ,"Months after Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees agreed to end a protracted legal fight, the two sides are set to approve an agreement that could result in the company investing up to $17 billion into its Florida resort and opens the door to a fifth major theme park at Walt Disney World.

The five DeSantis-appointed supervisors who oversee the Disney World district voted Wednesday to give initial approval to a new development agreement that both sides had agreed to negotiate after a March settlement ended their state court lawsuits against each other.

A second vote was required for final approval, and that was set for next week.

“We are heading towards a brand new day, and I’m excited about where this is going,” said Charbel Barakat, vice chair of the district’s board. “I only wish we could have gotten here sooner.”

Woody Rodriguez, director of external affairs for the Disney parks, told board members that the agreement will allow the company to make substantial investments in Disney World.

The agreement between Disney and the Central Florida Tourism and Oversight District would last for the next 15 years. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things. It was controlled by Disney supporters for most of its five decades until it was taken over by the DeSantis appointees last year.

Under the deal’s terms, during the next decade or two, Disney would be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney would retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment.

In exchange, Disney would be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also would need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida.

The settlement in March ended almost two years of litigation that was sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district from Disney supporters following the company’s opposition to a Florida law critics dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”

The 2022 law bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades and was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign this year.

As punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. As part of the March settlement, Disney agreed to put on hold the appeal of the federal lawsuit.

Before control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.

Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.

1d3iy1j_PATH,PATH,Walt Disney (DIS) 2Q24 Earnings: Mixed Results but Promising Future?,"Walt Disney (DIS) just released their 2Q24 earnings report. Here are the key takeaways:

Overall Performance:
	•	Revenue: Slightly below expectations but up 1.2% YoY.
	•	EPS: Better than expected, growing to $1.21 per share.

Perspective:

Overall, Disney’s 2Q24 results show a positive recovery path with reduced losses in streaming and strong growth in parks. However, the muted growth forecast for streaming subscribers and a potential slowdown in park attendance post-COVID have led to a 9.5% drop in the stock price.

In the short term, there are potential downsides for DIS due to:

	1.	Strategic shifts causing operational volatility.
	2.	Rising expenses, particularly depreciation of Goodwill related to Star India operations.
	3.	Downgraded current quarter forecasts.
	4.	External pressures like consumer spending slowdown and uneven global economic recovery.

Despite these challenges, I believe DIS could see positive developments in 2H24 due to:

	1.	Continued profit turnaround in streaming.
	2.	Parks benefiting from resilient travel demand.
	3.	Potential Fed rate cuts improving consumer spending, benefiting core businesses like parks and streaming.

In my opinion, watching for dips in DIS stock, potentially below $100, for a good risk-reward entry point. The current PE is 22.2x, below the 5-year average of 33.3x. Bloomberg’s target price is $126.9, offering a 20.3% upside from the current level.

1c1i7l2_DIS,DIS,Disney (DIS) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

Disney (DIS) is well-known globally for creating magical worlds and experiences for all their fans, having a long decorated history of significantly impacting the childhoods of kids worldwide. DIS clinched all 5 top spots for box office performance in 2019 ([SOURCE](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2019/)), as a testament to their ability to narrate engaging and captivating stories to a diverse audience globally. However, DIS has recently lost its magic with sub-par performance for its films, disappointing Direct To Consumer (DTC ) subscriber numbers, and a proxy battle with an activist investor. The future growth of DIS is unstable given that linear network which contributes about 15% of their revenue is rapidly phasing out and DIS is still hemorrhaging money on DTC.   


# Revenue:

Disney splits their business into 3 segments. “Entertainment”, “Sports”, and “Experiences”

***Linear Network***  
In the Dealbook Summit, Bob Iger believes that Linear Network is no longer part of the core business of DIS and should be running complimentary to other avenues of the business such as streaming.  
  
I don’t believe Linear Networks will be present in the long run, Linear networks have a large price tag for consumers due to the long-standing price agreement between cable channels and cable distributors. On top of that, from an economic perspective, the investment into equipment required for both consumers and cable companies for Linear networks is significant so the price tag attached to Linear Networks will stay high. Compared to DTC which requires lesser investments.

According to ([SOURCE](https://www.marketingcharts.com/television/tv-audiences-and-consumption-118368)). People aged <34 only accounted for 16% of total viewing minutes for linear TV. With people aged > 55 accounting for 60% of total viewing minutes. I believe this trend will persist as new consumption habits favoring DTC are cultivated in the newer generation, leading to a permanent shift in consumption patterns in the near future. I assumed that in 10 years Linear Network would contribute only 40% of the revenue it contributed in 2023. As the number of elderly declines, this leads to a fall in the economic viability of Linear Networks. At the end of my forecast, I assumed that Linear Network only contributed ⅓ of the revenue it did in 2023.

***Disney+***

“we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business…from implementing stronger standards around account sharing. Although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025.” - 2023 Q4 10-K  
  
When forecasting the number of subscribers, the main catalyst for Disney+ growth comes in the form of better user monetization, better user experience (better algorithms and UI), better content, and the consolidation of the streaming industry. DIS recently announced its plans to crack down on password sharing ([SOURCE](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121189/disney-plus-paid-password-sharing-crackdown-june)) to reach profitability.   
In terms of better user experience e.g. UI, DIS has to improve it to better compete with Netflix. The user interface has to entice viewers visually within a short time or the user would lose interest. Netflix’s attempt to resolve this issue is through selective cover pictures for series based on user preference. There is also the issue of better-personalised recommendations.   
In terms of better content, DIS has recently been producing lackluster films, these films receive vastly negative reviews as they’re accused of being repetitive and DIS is simply riding on their past successes instead of innovating ([SOURCE](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/28/disney-box-office-wish-the-marvels)). This poor quality content affects the “value” that Disney+ brings. “value” to consumers is important. Despite DIS getting the largest chunk of its revenue from the US, DIS is only the 3rd most popular streaming platform in the US. Losing out to Amazon Prime and Netflix, both provided more “value” to consumers. I believe that in my base case, it would take the streaming industry another 4 years to consolidate.  
  
When forecasting the Churn rate, as DIS’ value bundle provides immense value to consumers when combined, it improves the churn rate for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ ([SOURCE](https://www.indiewire.com/news/analysis/disney-bundle-cost-churn-rate-netflix-1234876494/)). I assumed that the churn rate for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ remained at 4% before declining in the later parts of my forecast due to the streaming industry consolidating ([SOURCE](https://www.thecurrent.com/streaming-consolidation-upfront-media)). When the streaming industry consolidates, more people try out DIS DTC for the first time so I assumed that it would take a period before the churn rate tapers downwards.  
  
When forecasting revenue/subscribers, I assumed that the Ad-Tier and paid tier earned similar amounts per subscriber. The difference in sales price between the tiers was made up by advertisement revenue. As the streaming industry consolidates it gives DIS stronger power to control prices. 

***Disney+ HotStar***

Hot Star has suffered substantially as it lost the online streaming rights to India’s premier cricket league (IPL) ([SOURCE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2023/09/27/disney-faces-decisions-in-india-do-nothing-sell-assets-or-find-a-partner/?sh=677870815da2)). This loss in rights led to Disney+ Hotstar hemorrhaging 20 million subscribers, demonstrating the importance of sports to India. However, DIS decided to merge with another streaming giant in India, Reliance ([SOURCE](https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-buzz/story/reliance-disney-merger-heres-how-the-deal-can-fundamentally-transform-indias-media-and-entertainment-landscape-420683-2024-03-08#:~:text=Billionaire%20Mukesh%20Ambani's%20Reliance%20Industries,and%20two%20digital%20streaming%20platforms)). Reliance which owns Viacom, was the one who managed to wrest control of streaming rights for the IPL from DIS. I believe that this merger will allow Disney+ Hotstar to regain the grounds that it lost and push its combined lead in the Indian streaming market further. The agreement for this merger is that DIS will only own 37% of the JV. But, given that this combined entity has such a large control over the streaming market I believe that this lends them a lot of powers to set prices.  
The sports market is big in India, across all sports the market has a base of 600M viewers ([SOURCE](https://www.ormaxmedia.com/insights/stories/678-million-sports-audiences-in-india-game-on.html#:~:text=Sizing%20India's%20Sports%20Audience%20Universe&text=As%20per%20the%20report%2C%20India's,%2C%20305%20%26%20280%20million%20respectively)). Cricket which is one of the most popular sports in India, the IPL reached viewerships of 300+ million ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1416941/india-sports-tv-reach-by-league/)). I believe this number will only continue growing given the rapidly expanding population of India.  
When forecasting the number of subscribers, I don’t believe that Disney+ Hotstar follows the same trend as the global Disney+. I believe the catalyst for Disney+ Hotstar’s growth comes from how effectively smartphone penetrates the Indian market ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/V937bMC)). Taking reference from Q1 2024 Data, In my base case, they recovered all grounds it lost in terms of subscribers in 2 years. I assumed that Disney+ Hotstar experienced astronomical growth in the first 10 years. I believe 10 years is reasonable because in 10 years India would have a similar smartphone penetration rate as the US in 2024 at 92%, indicating a market that is primed and ready for the streaming revolution. This leads to a phasing out of linear TV in favor of SVOD.  
When forecasting the revenue/subscriber, I assumed that DIS recovered all the pricing power it lost. In the first 10 years, while the streaming industry consolidates Disney+ Hotstar will not increase prices substantially before increasing prices to a significant extent and growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

***Hulu***  
As Linear Network begins declining, I believe that the popularity of Hulu Live TV will decline as well. Some of the younger audience of Hulu will migrate to Hulu SVOD. Hulu is centered around streaming recently aired TV shows.   
  
When forecasting the number of subscribers, I assumed that Hulu SVOD followed the same trend as Disney+.

When forecasting Revenue/Subsceirbers, as Hulu historically had very low pricing power due to the presence of Linear TV disrupting their USP, I assumed that Hulu did not raise their prices until Linear TV phased out to a very large extent 10 years into my forecast. 

***ESPN***  
“the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand.” - 2023 Q4 10-K  
  
The plan for ESPN is to transition from ESPN+ to ESPN DTC. ESPN+ is not ESPN’s full catalog, certain shows such as Monday night football are still locked to ESPN Cable. A major risk for ESPN is that other DTC companies like Netflix, Apple, and Amazon have started bidding for sports rights, where previously the only major player in this space was ESPN.  
  
DIS is planning on rolling out DTC ESPN by the fall of 2025 ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/espn-will-launch-its-flagship-direct-to-consumer-service-in-fall-2025.html#:~:text=ESPN%20will%20launch%20its%20flagship%20direct%2Dto%2Dconsumer%20streaming%20service,with%20networks%20from%20Warner%20Bros)). I believe that the ESPN DTC will consolidate all of the content that ESPN produces and the high churn rate due to a lack of quality sports content will decline.  
  
When forecasting the number of subscribers, I assume that after DTC ESPN is released it will take about 3 years for the consumer to shift their habits. I also believe that DTC ESPN follows the same growth trend as Disney+  
  
I assumed that DTC for sports would contribute about 30% of the sports revenue 10 years into my forecast and would increase to 40% of the sports revenue by the end of my forecast.

***Content Sales/Licensing***  
I believe that each year DIS is only able to release \~10 films per year to maintain the high quality of their release. And, given the unpredictability of box office results, I forecasted Average Revenue/Film at historical averages growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

***Experiences***  
“While domestic parks and experiences is expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World in addition to wage inflation.” - 2023 Q4 10-K  
  
When forecasting the total acres available, Disneyland Paris is half developed, I assume it will be fully developed within the next 10 years. I also assumed that no other land acquisition would be made.  
  
When forecasting revenue/acre available, given the large number of competing modals of entertainment e.g. AR/VR, social media. I believe that theme parks will have significantly larger competition going forward, so to avoid being too granular I forecasted Revenue/acre available to grow in line with inflation.

# Cost:

When forecasting both COGS and SG&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# CapEX and D&A:

DIS believes to compete with Netflix it has to lean on some of its previous series which allows for lower consumer acquisition costs. “dial back a bit on some of the spending and investment in series. And that blend of spending between films and series, we believe, gives an opportunity to increase our margins and grow the business.” - 2023 Q4 10-K

“we expect capex in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion” - 2023 Q4 10-K  
  
“we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion” - 2023 Q4 10-K

When forecasting D&A and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.30%

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value DIS at $63.39 per share. I believe that DIS is still overvalued based on the strong goodwill they have built over time which causes investors to have too much confidence in DIS. The uncertainty in DTC and how the big players are going to compete in the realm of sports resulted in DIS having a lot of risk. I believe that for DIS to live up to its value, the effectiveness of its DTC and the streaming market consolidation has to be present, for them to have a higher valuation.

1bnmvzo_DIS,DIS,Barclay upgrades Disney expecting streamer profitability sooner than guided & to achieve 25-30% margins. DIS is up 3% today; up 30% YTD," Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and boosted his price target on shares to **$135 from the prior $95**. The move implies roughly 15% upside based on current trading levels of about **$120** a share.

Venkateshwar argued better-than-expected free cash flow and earnings guidance, coupled with ""tactical tailwinds"" such as the Hollywood strikes, Hulu's consolidation, and cost cuts, have helped buoy investor confidence. 

Meanwhile, ""*the propensity among media investors to be long Disney, has resulted in the stock outperforming broader markets meaningfully thus far this year, at a pace faster than we anticipated*.""

The stock has been on a tear since the start of the year, up more than **30%** compared to the S&P 500's 10% rise over that same time period.

It's a significant turnaround for the company after its stock price hit multiyear lows last year. The media giant has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming business. A heated proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz has also clouded the company's outlook.

But Venkateshwar argued Disney's next phase ""*may be more impactful as a number of turnaround elements still remain work in progress and may manifest more in numbers starting next year*.""

In his bull case, the analyst said **sooner-than-expected streaming profitability** could serve as a boon to the stock price.

*""We expect Disney streaming to break even potentially a quarter or two earlier than company guidance of Q4 2024*,"" he explained. ""*This is in part driven by the tailwinds from cost cuts over the last few quarters and recent price increases*.""

Venkateshwar said he believes Disney will likely achieve streaming margins ""*that are better than Netflix*,"" estimating potential margins in the **25% to 30% range**, ""*which is not too different from where linear margins today are*.""

Other ""*upside narrative surprises*"" could include **ESPN's** yet-to-be-announced streaming partners for its over-the-top service, set to debut sometime in fall 2025, in addition to a refocused attention on long-term **succession** plans post-proxy battle.

Conversely, the analyst's bear case calls out declining non-sports TV viewership as linear network revenue falls amid increased cord cutting. Streaming, although a potential positive, could also be a net negative if subscriber growth does not pick up and pricing headwinds hit revenue growth.

1al4tvg_DIS,DIS,Disney (DIS) Analysis,"For the next analysis we will be looking at Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) earnings. This company is a staple of American culture but has struggled tremendously in recent years due to Covid-19 and more recently adjusting to the direction of the industry in terms of streaming. The company released Disney+ to compete with the likes of Netflix and others. Many analysts are expecting the company to perform well with their theme parks, but many question marks remain on the profitability and viability of the streaming service they offer. Disney will report earnings after the bell on February 7th with the earnings call to follow. Guidance will be incredibly important with this report, as will streaming numbers. With that being said, let’s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.

Description: 

Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is an American media conglomerate that acts as an umbrella for many household names like Disney, Pixar, ESPN, and 20th Century Studios. The company has recently developed the Disney+ streaming service to compete with companies like Netflix and develop a more thorough revenue stream. The company is plagued with many issues, from performing poorly in the box office to losing money with their streaming service. However, there should be positive information about ESPN+ which is also owned by Disney and showcases many sports, particularly the NFL so I expect this to be a big positive as well. This quarter Disney hopes to report increased performance within their theme parks, increasing subscriber numbers within Disney+, and a reduction in the operating loss of the business. Earlier this year the company went through a round of layoffs where 7,000 jobs were cut in hopes of reducing costs. We hope to see those cost reductions acting positively and increasing the efficiency of the business. The strong sentiment on Wall Street is that the company is considered a buy, which could certainly be the case if the company manages to overcome a poor quarter in the box office and calm the worries of many with their guidance. 

Financial Breakdown:

LTM Price Increase: $111.63 – $99.29 (-11.05%)
Subscribers: 150.2 Million Subscribers (+2.38% Q3)
Revenue increase: +5% YoY Q3 and +29% YTD 2023
Competitors: Netflix (NFLX), Sony (SONY), Fox Corporation (FOX)

Earnings:

Q3 Reported EPS: $0.82 (+15.11% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $21.24B (-0.79% delta)

Stock Move: Stock jumped 6.91% after earnings

Q4 Expected EPS: $1.04 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $23.77B

Verdict: 

With Disney reporting earnings after market close on February 7th, it will be difficult to find an easy play because of the uncertainty, along with potential opportunities present within the company. Theme parks will most likely be a strong positive, with more individuals visiting this winter quarter particularly during school breaks. Several eyewitness reports suggest it was “unprecedently crowded this year”. This, along with the effects of earlier layoffs should hopefully slim down the company and reduce their operating losses. But, despite all the potential positives major threats also exist in the likes of Disney+ performance. If streaming numbers come in lower than expected, or guidance is viewed as negative for the rest of the year, the stock price will get pummeled no matter how successful the theme parks were. The lack of box office films also poses a threat this quarter. Several flops could put a damper on the earnings report. Next up, my opinion on how this company will fare this quarter. 

Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. Looking at this earnings report, I understand the concern of where the company is heading due to a lack of box office production in recent quarters. However, I think the combination of theme parks, layoffs, and improved guidance for 2024 will make the stock pop ~7% or so to a price of about $105.00. Looking at the contracts available, I did not purchase too many calls due to the uncertainty present and better opportunities in the market. However, I did pick up 3 $100 Calls expiring February 9th in anticipation of a potential bounce IF AND ONLY IF subscription numbers come in better than expected and guidance is positive. It won’t matter how good earnings are if numbers or guidance disappoints. Overall, this play is very risky but I think the positives outweigh the negatives making me lean toward an increase post earnings. 

We have a few more earnings to play this week (PYPL, PINS, etc.), so expect to see more posts like this one. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!

EDIT: Watch for the potential impacts of boycotts affecting the companies earnings this quarter, ranging from their stance on the Middle East to being woke ",2024-02-07,45,99
1alditr_DIS,DIS,Disney Earnings Options Analysis: Better For Long Or Short Volatility?,"Disney’s upcoming earnings report is generating significant anticipation. Let’s analyze the potential playability of its options, considering both long and short volatility strategies.

# Past Moves Analysis

First of all, let’s study DIS past moves outlook. How did it move and how volatile it is around earnings?Let’s look at the **histogram of past moves** over the last 10 years — showing the past moves values versus their occurrence, so essentially a frequency chart of the past moves.

https://preview.redd.it/kf48gwr388hc1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b05b978e27e27c091e9351f420d79d3e06a31ee

We see that, as expected, the distribution looks centered around the most frequent move around +/-4%.

Moves above and beyond this value are less frequent, however we notice some occurrences of big downward moves around -7 and -8%.

**Overall, unlike other very volatile stocks on earnings, DIS moves seem well contained with maximum values around +/-11%, and one outlier move of -14% that happened on 2022–11–08.**

This is a first **good signal for perhaps a short volatility trade**, where we would sell options to profit from IV crush, betting that the move will be lower than the implied one.

Looking at the exact breakdown of past moves, we see that DIS was actually quite volatile in the last year, with somewhat big moves exceeding that +/-4% average we noted.

https://preview.redd.it/3zgccep588hc1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce440bab278604a5d01deb8f79b71690af8b976c

Notice how the amplitude of move on earnings in 2023 is quite higher than during 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/gp5qlk4888hc1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b3d9e0c5cb8d4dc872ec01be6afac2f6951ef34

**This is not very reassuring for our short volatility thesis.**

We really would like a breakeven wide enough to capture these higher moves around 7 or 8%, or at least a position that is well covered against these levels of moves.

# Potential Positions

Now that we studied the past moves outlook and got our insights of the key numbers to keep in mind, we can start calibrating a short volatility position.

**Two important things to keep in mind when entering such a trade: the likelihood of success, and the risk reward profile.**

**The likelihood of success** involves evaluating the probability of our position being profitable, by comparing its break-even point to the historical price movements we’ve researched.

In the case of DIS, we observed an average move of +/-4% and a recent trend with larger swings around +/-8%.

Therefore, a position with a break-even point higher than the historical swings of +/-8% would be highly probable to succeed for our short volatility thesis, given that past moves rarely exceeded this range.

**Risk reward** is simply our potential loss versus our potential reward.

Again, the past moves analysis help us benchmark these scenarios, by looking at the position pnl or minimum and maximum historic moves.

We see here the classic closest to expiration short straddle DIS 99c 99p 02–09:

https://preview.redd.it/c916yt0a88hc1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd6bd5b267d77e93baba21bdcaa499fb7e3d8421

The position premium is $5.63 and the idea is to buy it back for profit after the earnings release, expecting its value to **drop from iv crush** and a not sufficient past move.

This short straddle breakeven is +/-4.8%.

This is above that past average of +/-4% but **not wide enough** to cover all the past distribution.

Our best case scenario is to buy back the position at $2.67 at open if the stocks moves 0% — quite unlikely but this is our best case scenario, making for a 52% potential reward.

However, if the stock moves +/-8%, the straddle will be worth $8.9 making for a 52% loss.

https://preview.redd.it/sr1nbrvb88hc1.png?width=3358&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfa02a1036e921fa905b105eae6da1fcb73475b

This makes for the risk reward score of 63% — **the risk of the position is still quite high**, compared to the best case scenario profit.

We can try to lower this potential loss by not going with short straddles but buying a wider strangle to cover, making what we call a butterfly.

Here we see a list of possible butterfly positions. we see they cost less than the short straddle.

https://preview.redd.it/12e5pzmd88hc1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c37aab18ed957be0621b9d9d18c04930e1d891

For example, this short 99p 99c 02–16 long 105c 93p shows a similar breakeven at nearly +/-4.5%, costing $4.13 and best case scenario to buy it back for $2.49 for no stock move.

We have lowered our exposure to the recent big moves of +/-8%, with a loss of -36%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v70m15z698hc1.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a4f8ac2cd6be23681a2ffd3424ef4cdd018b98

This can be a better risk reward position, but with still a low likelihood of success given our somewhat small breakeven compared to the past moves.

&#x200B;

**In summary, DIS doesn’t appear favorable for either a long or short volatility opportunity.**

While it may initially seem intriguing for short volatility, we couldn’t identify a trade offering a satisfactory likelihood of success coupled with a wide enough breakeven.

Additionally, the risk-reward ratio was unappealing, with the potential loss outweighing the potential reward.

This analysis is a good illustration of an analysis that may lead to the decision to skip a trade, despite the allure of anticipated earnings. Ultimately, given the unfavourable market conditions and the disproportionate risk-to-reward ratio, it’s prudent to forgo the opportunity.",2024-02-07,5,1

1aldp6e_DIS,DIS,"Disney beats earnings estimates, hikes guidance as it slashes streaming losses","LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the media giant slashed costs while revenue stagnated. 

The company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023. 

Disney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected

Revenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected


Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.

Disney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.

The company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year. 

While no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.

Disney’s earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.

While Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.

Peltz has cited the company’s stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.

CEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney’s theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney’s box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.

Also of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney’s streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company’s theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.

*In Q4 2023, Walt Disney reported a revenue of $21.2 billion; -4.88% from the previous quarter but an increase of 5.41% compared to last year. Revenue from Parks surged by 13% YOY to $8.2 billion, propelled international parks. Segment operating income also saw a significant uptick, rising by 31% year-over-year to $1.76 billion.*

*The Media and Entertainment Distribution segment witnessed + 2% YOY in revenue reaching $9.5 billion, but a 9% decline in Linear Networks revenue to $2.6 billion. DTC showed promise with a 12% YOY increase to $5.04 billion. Operating losses in this segment notably narrowed to -$0.42 billion. Disney+ subscribers grew to 150.2 million, halting the declining trend observed over three consecutive quarters. Notably, ARPU for domestic Disney+ increased by $0.19 to $7.50, while international Disney+ saw a $0.09 increase to $6.10. Management expressed optimism about future prospects.*

\****Market Projections for Q1:*** *according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, sales revenue for the upcoming quarter is anticipated to reach $23.8 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a 1.2% increase from the same period last year. Operating profit and net income are expected to show significant improvement, reaching $3.5 billion and $1.62 billion, respectively.*

***\*Disney's guidance for Q1 in the last quarter:*** *Disney expects free cash flow to reach pre-pandemic levels in FY24. It also expects DTC profitability by Q4 FY24. However, that DTC growth won't be linear; Disney expects a small drop in sub count due to churn after raising prices and the summer promotions. Some analysts expect 0.8 to 1 mil decline in sub count but to resume growth in Q2. Disney in its guidance for Q1 FY24 expects operating losses in DTC-entertainment to be flat but that of sports to go up slightly to due to sports rights.*

***\*Technical analysis:*** *Resistance at 105 but Disney’s share price remains above its 52-week low, with strong support levels around $75.30. A bullish breakout above the dynamic resistance could potentially target levels around $105.60 and $126.40.*

Well here's a chance at reaping some nice gains from the coming AI revolution yet. Hear me out:   


Its only a matter of time, 2-5yrs probs, until AI is able to just copy anything it sees, including people's personalities just by watching enough videos of them. Ofcourse lawmakers will probalby make it or many forms of it illegal.   
However that wouldn't apply to fictional characters..!  Think about it, Marvel heros, Starwars characters, Disney Princesses, the whole IP list under $DIS is just a treasure trove of copyrighted source material which AI will be able to study and turn into a live personality!   
Imagine AI Barbie dolls and Ironman/Thor/Obiwan action figures & holograms having conversations with you in real character (like that Blackmirror episode).  
Every kid/fan will want one. This plus AI generated TV content (will take more time but also coming). New shows/movies, or just random generated scenes of your favorite character doing stuff which you can watch on an app. 

Anyway, their IP is the important thing here, and the amount of revenue they'll be able to generate off of it will be insane simply because they own the rights to so many well-known fictional characters.   


TLDR: buy and hodl $DIS and watch it eventually end up making a NVDA like move. Timeframe hard to say. Its a long game for sure. \~5yrs probs (though AI can advance much faster than that & market loves pricing things in early...)

> 
> The boutique investment firm, which typically focuses on family wealth and asset management, penned a letter to fellow Disney shareholders supporting Peltz and his firm, Trian Fund Management in the quest for access to the boardroom.
> 
> “We believe Disney is saying the right things about restructuring and transforming the enterprise,” Ancora Holdings Group Chairman and CEO Frederick DiSanto and Ancora Alternatives President James Chadwick wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “Nonetheless, the addition of a shareholder representative or investor-designated directors to the board can help ensure that these efforts are carried out in the most effective way.”
> 
> Hoping to “avert an election contest following a year of distractions and disappointing performance” the letter called for shareholders to encourage the board “to pursue a viable compromise” with Peltz and Trian, the letter said.
> 
> Disney last week roundly rebuffed Peltz’s latest effort to obtain board seats for Trian, maintaining that the effort is rooted in former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter’s “longstanding personal agenda” against Disney CEO Bob Iger.

> Perlmutter has joined his considerable stake in Disney stock, about 25 million shares, with Trian’s holdings of about 8 million shares, in the campaign to place Peltz and allies on the board.

> 
> “A degree of shareholder-driven change is certainly warranted in Disney’s boardroom following an extended period of absentminded governance, ineffective succession planning, polarizing actions and sustained value destruction,” the firm’s letter states. “Many of Disney’s current directors and executives bear responsibility for lapses that have undermined the company’s positioning in the exceedingly competitive and ever-changing entertainment world.
> 
> “While it has been argued that challenges largely stem from the tenure of Bob Chapek, the board was in the driver’s seat before, during and after that time,” it continues. “The upshot is that Disney shareholders have incurred meaningful losses,” and the company has “dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Index” the letter states.
> 
> It also accuses the board of overseeing “a deterioration of what was once the most unifying brand in the world,” by “allowing Disney to devote shareholders’ resources to a number of politicized initiatives.” It does not specify what those initiatives are, but the implicit suggestion is Disney’s fight with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
> 
> “The Company is increasingly dividing – rather than delighting – a growing number of consumers,” the letter states, citing a recent poll that found Disney is the fifth most polarizing brand in the world, right behind the disgraced and collapsed crypto exchange FTX.
> 
> “Disney’s board faces a number of pivotal decisions over the next 12 to 24 months as it rebuilds consumer trust and oversees a complex transformation that includes an optimization of the streaming segment, a direct-to-consumer pivot for ESPN, the evolution of the Company’s film studios and a growth plan for parks,” the letter continued. “The board will also once again need to engage in critical succession planning. Having a sizable owner in the boardroom to bring the market’s perspective and serve as one of many voices would only benefit shareholders. While this type of director may not always be needed at Disney, we contend it is the right addition at this key moment in time.”
> 
> The letter also slapped back at the investment firm Blackwells Capital, another large shareholder that last week urged Peltz to end what it called his “ego-driven campaign.” Ancora called the firm’s principal, Jason Aintabi, “a publicity-seeking greenmailer with a questionable personal and business history” who opposes Peltz’s efforts despite having “made billions of dollars over many decades” through shareholder activism.

> The Mouse House also got an unsolicited vote of confidence, in a roundabout way, from Blackwells Capital, which said it is nominating three candidates to the board to rival those picked by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management in a looming proxy fight — although Blackwells called the media company’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything.”
> 
> Disney on Tuesday announced an “information sharing” deal with ValueAct, an investor in Disney, which ensures the investment firm will support the company’s recommended slate of nominees for election to the Disney board at the 2024 annual meeting. Under Disney’s confidentiality agreement with ValueAct, the media conglomerate will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on “strategic matters,” including through meetings with the Disney board and management.
> 
> Separately, Blackwells Capital, another Disney shareholder, announced that it will nominate three candidates — Jessica Schell, a former Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal exec; Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatkoff; and TaskRabbit founder Leah Solivan — for election to the board of directors of Disney, which is expected to be held this spring. In announcing the trio of candidates, Blackwells slammed “Peltz’s reprise of a contrived campaign that is disconnected from the needs of Disney stakeholders.”
> 
> Disney confirmed that Blackwells Capital provided notice of its intent to nominate the three individuals for election to the company’s board at the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Disney said the board’s governance and nominating committee “will review the proposed Blackwells nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.”
> 
> In late November, Peltz renewed his proxy battle with Iger and the company’s board and announced plans to nominate two directors. That came after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors.
> 
> Peltz’s Trian hedge fund subsequently announced it would nominate Peltz and former Disney CFO James Rasulo as candidates for directors of the Disney board at the annual shareholders meeting. Trian controls about $3 billion worth of Disney’s shares, 78% of which are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter (whom Disney alleges has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger).
> 
> Jason Aintabi, Blackwells’ chief investment officer, said in a statement, “We call on Mr. Peltz to end his peacocking so that Disney can focus on its bright future, and not be dragged backward in time. Disney’s current leadership is invaluable to its shareholders, and our three exceptional candidates are being nominated along with a business proposal specifying that any incumbent director outvoted by Blackwells’ nominees be immediately added back to the board following the 2024 Annual Meeting.”
> 
> Blackwells’ campaign “provides shareholders a necessary alternative to what would otherwise be a solipsistic sideshow,” Aintabi added. Blackwells owns about $5 million worth of Disney shares.
> 
> At the same time, Aintabi called Disney’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything. Bringing all shareholders a real and better choice for directors is the necessary act that will support the future success of Disney.”
> 
> In response to the Blackwells announcement, a rep for Trian said in a statement, “Trian welcomes other shareholders attempting to help fix this iconic but wayward company. We believe long-suffering Disney shareholders need Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo as independent voices and catalysts for much-needed change on what’s been a chronically underperforming board.”
> 
> To that, Blackwells’ Aintabi responded, “We are gratified that Trian sees the merit in Blackwells nominees given they are independent, have the relevant experience and present themselves without an agenda. Our view remains that Disney shareholders do not need Nelson Peltz or Jay Rasulo on the board; if anyone is needed it’s the Blackwells’ nominees.”
> 
> ValueAct, in announcing its agreement with the Disney board, touted its “extensive experience investing in media and technology companies navigating significant business transformations,” including Spotify, the New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Nintendo, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce.
> 
> Iger said in a statement, “ValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we’ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders.”
> 
> Morfit added: “Disney is the world’s leading entertainment company. It has the best intellectual property, sports brand, and parks and experiences assets in the industry. As legacy technologies transition to digital platforms, we believe Disney can lead the media industry forward. We could not be more excited to partner with Bob and the board to help create long-term sustainable shareholder value.”

...and that's why Peltz/Perlmutter will easily take over Disney since they're the most beloved folks among Disney investors while ValueAct/Iger are the most despised. In fact, here are conclusive proofs of that:

> **Bob Iger gets 'C' rating for Disney return: Analyst**
> 
> Bob Iger's return to Disney (DIS) is one of Yahoo Finance's top stories of 2023. Since reclaiming the helm as CEO, Iger cut costs and restructured the business into three divisions —Entertainment; Parks, Experiences and Products; and ESPN —as he looks to make Disney's streaming business profitable.
> 
> Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin, who covered the stock during Iger's first tenure as CEO, said she would give the media executive a 'C' for his first year back at Disney.
> 
> “It's hard to see him stumble in the first year… but in fairness to him, mostly what he's been doing is reversing things Bob Chapek did the prior two years,” Martin told Yahoo Finance Live. “It’s unclear he's been able to move forward at all rather than undoing the one bad decision he made in leadership, which was to hand the reins to Bob Chapek.”

> 
> And Laura, a near-term issues seems to be all of these activist battles. How should Bob Iger approach handling someone like Nelson Peltz, and perhaps others.
LAURA MARTIN: So I think what's great for public shareholders about somebody like Nelson Peltz is when Bob Iger comes out and says, we're going to spend $60 billion on the theme park over 10 years, that might be great for him. But public shareholders care about this year and next year because they're going to be retired in 10 years.
> 
> So I think what Nelson Peltz forces Bob Iger to do is justify the cost structure at the entertainment assets and the TV assets, compared to the revenue growth, which is single digits to negative. And it really forces him to cut costs. I think it's a primary reason they're going to cut a lot of content costs on the streaming side because they can't cut them on the sports side because their rights fees keep going up.
> 
> So I think what Nelson Peltz does is force Bob Iger to, basically, fire more people, which unless he can grow the revenue faster on the, let's call it the core business, the traditional business, he needs to cut the overhead here.
> 
> SEANA SMITH: So Laura, it sounds like, if I'm hearing you right, you think that maybe some of the changes that would be enacted by Nelson Peltz would actually better position Disney then for the future, and maybe make you a little bit more positive on the name.
> 
> LAURA MARTIN: I would say that Nelson Peltz is far more short-term oriented than Bob Iger who's a business builder. And I think public shareholders are more aligned with that kind of time frame.
> 
> BRAD SMITH: So with that considered, Laura, I mean, we've heard Disney talking about the thousands of acres of land that they could develop on, building out more of the parks, resorts experiences in other parts of the world. That still looks like money going out the door. So at what point do you think Disney is ultimately going to be able to deliver on this, and perhaps satisfy some of the investors?
> 
> LAURA MARTIN: So I think this is a tale of two cities right now, meaning that the parks are really healthy. So I think Wall Street is supportive of investing money in the parks because the return on capital of money into the parks is going to be positive. But I do think the traditional, like ESPN linear business and the studios have had underwhelming results, meaning, when the market's giving them capital, they're not actually over delivering the cost of capital.
> 
> So in order to do that, you have to cut costs. So I just think that the economics of the streaming/linear TV business are broken right now for the whole industry, not just for the Walt Disney Company, for the whole industry. So the industry needs to consolidate. It needs to rip out costs. It needs to spend less on content. And I think getting out of India is going to help Disney. They've announced that reliance. And Disney are in, I guess, a handshake deal right now. I think that's helpful. And I think, when they launch ESPN, the app, that's going to be helpful also.

By the way, we had these news so far:

> **Nelson Peltz's Trian to seek at least three Disney board seats, sources say**
> 
> Activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing ahead with plans to seek at least three board seats at Disney (DIS.N) as the firm is not satisfied with Disney CEO Bob Iger's changes, several people familiar with the matter said.
> 
> During a conversation on Thursday morning with Iger, Disney extended an offer for Trian to meet with the company's board but rejected the activist shareholder's request for seats on a board that will soon have 12 members, Trian said in a statement.
> 
> Trian, which owns roughly $3 billion worth of Disney stock, said it ""intends to take (its) case for change directly to shareholders,"" signaling it will proceed to a second proxy fight and nominate director candidates when the window for nominations opens early next month.
> 
> ""Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney's CEO is acknowledging that the company's challenges are greater than previously believed,"" Trian said in the statement.
> Shares in Disney, which has a market capitalization of $169 billion, are down 16% since Feb 9, when Peltz withdrew from his campaign to gain a board seat.
> 
> Investor enthusiasm lifted Disney stock 20% in the two-and-a-half months after Iger's return in November 2022 but lost most of the gains this year, closing on Thursday at $92.69 per share, less than a dollar higher than the price before Iger was brought back.
> 
> **RESTRUCTURING, COST-CUTTING**
> 
> Over the past 12 months, Disney has restructured the company and significantly reduced costs. It told investors earlier this month it is on track to achieve about $7.5 billion in cost savings – $2 billion more than its original target.
> 
> Disney said it will work to make its streaming business profitable, build ESPN into the ""pre-eminent"" digital sports brand, improve the performance of its film studios and ""turbocharge"" growth at its theme parks, through $60 billion in investment over the next decade.
> 
> Disney noted Peltz is allied with Isaac Perlmutter, a former Disney executive who was terminated earlier this year and has a ""longstanding personal agenda"" against Iger.
> 
> The company said Perlmutter's agenda ""may be different than that of all other shareholders.""
> 
> Despite Iger's efforts and Thursday morning's phone call, positions appear to have hardened this week.
> 
> Disney named soon-to-be-retiring Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman and veteran media executive and former group chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, to its board, a pre-emptive step companies targeted by activists often take.
> 
> The men will join early next year and former Illumina (ILMN.O) chief, Francis deSouza, will leave.
> 
> **SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT**
> 
> Another investor, Blackwells Capital, issued a statement of support for Iger and his restructuring of the company, as well as for the two new board members, Gorman and Darroch.
> 
> Blackwells said displacing these individuals with Peltz and other Trian nominees would deprive shareholders of ""valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history.""
> 
> Trian said while the two new Disney directors did represent an improvement from the status quo, they ""would not restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction"".
> 
> The Disney board on Thursday announced a cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on Jan. 10.
> 
> Disney said it will recommend shareholders support its slate of nominees. Investors and industry analysts are already calling the presumed battle Disney 2.0, but they note it might be tougher this time for Peltz to win over other shareholders.
> 
> Patrick Gadson, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins which is not involved, said proxy advisers will assess how much change Disney has accomplished.
> 
> ""If they’ve made significant progress,"" Gadson said of Disney, proxy advisers ""are more likely to allow for time to complete the transformation.""

...and Disney announced these plans:

> **Disney Reinstates Dividend, Amends Bylaws Amid Push By Nelson Peltz For Board Seat**
> 
> Disney today announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the second half of its fiscal 2023, its first such payout since the dividend was halted three years ago during Covid.
> 
> It will be payable January 10, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11. The company had said back in February that it planned to bring back the dividend this year.
> 
> “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth,” said Mark Parker, Chairman of the Board. “As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”
> 
> The dividend move comes as activist investor Nelson Peltz, backed by big Disney shareholder and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter, is seeking to join the board of the media giant — saying today he would bring the fight “directly to the shareholders” after Disney rejected his offer and named two new directors instead. This push by the founder of Trian Partners has led Disney to restate and amend its corporate bylaws that deal with outside candidates seeking board seats.
> 
> Shareholders elect directors at a company’s annual meeting. Companies list their nominated directors in a proxy statement ahead of the gathering and provide shareholders with a list of the names on proxy cards. Stockholders can also present other, outside candidates for director, not endorsed by the company, as Peltz says he intends to do. It’s not clear how many board seats he is gunning for. Disney’s fiscal year ends in September and its annual meeting is usually in sometime March. It was held a bit later this year, on April 3, as the company battled Peltz for the first time in the early part of the year. He withdrew from the fight in February, before the meeting. Prior to that, he had set up a dedicated website called Restore the Magic that detailed what he saw as Disney’s failings. Not clear yet what he’ll do this time around. Disney said earlier today that Perlmutter has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger.
> 
> The amendments laid out by Disney in an SEC filing today do the following:
> 
> -“Address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the Company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met.”
> 
> This SEC rule from last year (14a-19) requires all parties use a “universal” proxy card that lists all director nominees presented by both management and shareholders for election at the annual meeting. It was meant to make it easier to get outside shareholders candidates on the ballot so some companies (not just Disney) have been amending their bylaws to make it not quite so easy,
> 
> -“Require that any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.” The white card is typically used by management.
> 
> -“Enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to…director nominations made by stockholders, including by requiring: certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies; and any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the Company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”

> **Disney Board Adopts New Rules for Nominating Directors in Wake of Nelson Peltz’s Announced Proxy Fight**
> 
> Company also announces first cash dividend for shareholders in more than three years
> 
> The same day activist investor Nelson Peltz announced he was launching a proxy campaign to get seats on Disney’s board of directors, the company adopted amended bylaws covering nominations of directors by outside parties.
> 
> Meanwhile, in a bid to win shareholder favor amid the brewing proxy battle, Disney separately Thursday announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable Jan. 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 11, 2023. It’s the company’s first dividend payments to investors in more than three years, after Disney suspended them during the COVID pandemic.
> 
> On Nov. 30, Disney’s board “amended and restated” the company’s bylaws, which became effective as of Thursday, the company said in an SEC filing Thursday.
> 
> Among other things, the amendments “enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to business proposals submitted and director nominations made by stockholders,” Disney said in the filing. That includes requiring “certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies” and that “any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”
> 
> In addition, Disney’s revised bylaws “address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met,” Disney said.
> 
> The SEC’s Rule 14a-19, which went into effect for shareholder meetings involving contested director elections held after Aug. 31, 2022, establish new notice and filing requirements for all soliciting parties, as well as formatting and presentation requirements for universal proxy cards. In addition, the rules require shareholders presenting their own director candidates in the contest to solicit holders of a minimum of 67% of the voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election.
> 
> Disney’s new bylaws also require that “any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.”
> 
> The announced intention by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to launch a proxy fight to get its directors on the board comes a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024.
> 
> Peltz’s Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, issued a statement Thursday that after the Disney board rejected Trian’s request for board seats, including one for Peltz, the hedge fund will “take our case for change directly to shareholders.”
> 
> In response, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter “was terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney’s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.” Perlmutter did not immediately have any comment, his rep said.
> 
> On Thursday, investment management company Blackwells Capital, a Disney shareholder since 2018, weighed in on the drama by issuing a statement of support for Iger’s leadership of the company and the board appointments of Gorman and Darroch. “Displacing these individuals or other members of the board with Mr. Peltz and other Trian-selected nominees would deprive shareholders of valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history,” Blackwells said. “Blackwells is concerned that Trian’s campaign prioritizes Mr. Peltz’s ego over what is best for all Disney shareholders, and that its latest effort may cost Disney shareholders upwards of $50 million and serve only as a value destructive fog for Disney’s leadership and board.”
> 
> Blackwells chief investment officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement, “Mindless, drum-beating activism is not the right strategy for shareholders. Disney’s board is acting in the best interests of all shareholders and should be allowed the time to focus on driving value at one of America’s most iconic companies without this fatuous sideshow.”
> 
> Regarding the reinstatement of the dividend, Disney chairman Mark Parker said in a statement, “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth. As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”

And when it comes to dividend, one guy is pointing this out:

> they have about 1.8 billion shares outstanding, so it's roughly a $550 million payout. the last time they paid a dividend was 2019, and they paid out $0.88 per share; roughly 3x as much.
> 
> just to put in perspective, disney is going to lose about $500 million in november alone from the marvels and wish flops.

https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/187u045/disney_brings_back_its_dividend_after_threeyear/kbh01np/

All of these are 100% conclusive proofs that Iger knows that he will lose the proxy war for certain and will be ousted and get replaced by Peltz and/or Perlmutter as the next CEO, especially since Iger is the most despised individual among every single Disney shareholders/investors while Peltz/Trian is/are the most beloved folks among every single Disney shareholders/investors. Those who claim that Peltz/Perlmutter can't become Disney CEOs themselves, they will become Disney CEOs because they will fire every single Disney board members and replace them entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons. How? By bringing in a puppet CEO whom they will control very easily:

> Pelz is gonna handpick your buddy Igers replacement very soon. No more pandering anymore, enjoy.

https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceom7n/

> I said pick the replacement, doubt they will run it themselves (at least not for long) but it’ll prevent some Iger loyalist hack

https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kcep6v5/

> Highly doubt Chapek would come back, and Iger’s words are meaningless at this point. Probably will be pull someone cutthroat that will stop employees from dictating the company, maybe a video game executive or something

https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceuqx9/

Once they make a video game executive their puppet CEO, all of these will happen overnight and they will become the majority Disney shareholder or even own every single Disney shares.

The problem is, Peltz has a history of completely hacking off General Electric until there was nothing left and Perlmutter has a history of saying this:

> If Disney's stock price keeps falling, Iger also has to worry about agitating more investors.
> 
> Iger is already tangling with ex-Marvel exec Ike Perlmutter, one of Disney's biggest individual shareholders, who has joined activist investor Peltz's fight to try to improve Disney's results by getting a bigger say over its strategy and operations.
> 
> **Perlmutter has told people he wants to break up Disney as much as he can and gain control of some of the IP, and ""people underestimate Ike at their peril,"" said a source familiar with Perlmutter's conversations.**
> 
> Disney's largely liberal stance on hot-button social issues could bring out other activist investors with political as well as financial motivations, like Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management, a big GOP donor. There are people who ""would love to take down the 'woke' company,"" the source added.

https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-iger-ceo-disney-return-insiders-anxious-losing-faith-2023-11

...which is why all of these will happen soon after 2023:

1. Bob Iger, Pete Docter, Kevin Feige, Jennifer Lee, and Kathleen Kennedy will get fired immediately and Peltz/Perlmutter will become co-CEOs of Disney while the entire Disney board will be replaced with Trian members and Perlmutter's minions while Docter, Feige, and Lee will respectively be replaced by John Kricfalusi, Ethan Van Sciver, and Chris Savino.

2. Literally every single upcoming Disney releases including **Kingdomf of the Planet of the Apes**, **Inside Out 2**, **Deadpool 3**, **Elio**, and **Avatar 3** will be completely scrapped for tax write-offs.

3. Pixar will be sold to Sony (which then will be shut down entirely), Walt Disney Animation Studios will be sold to Comcast (which then will be shut down entirely), Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios will be sold to The Daily Wire, and Marvel will be kept by Perlmutter himself.

4. Kevin Feige, Pete Docter, and Jennifer Lee will be completely blacklisted from Hollywood by Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora for spreading ""woke and pedophilic agenda"" to children. Feige and Docter will flee to Japan where the former will become a producer of **Godzilla** films and other Toho monster films while the latter will become a full-time animator at Studio Ghibli. Lee, on the other hand, will never be heard from ever again. Ironically, Kathleen Kennedy will be spared due to her status as a veteran producer.

5. Every single Disney theme parks will be demolished to make ways for something else. In places of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, state prisons will be built, in place of Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Resort California, Russian propaganda centers will be built to improve the reputation of Russia, and in place of Tokyo Disney Resort, hentai clubs will be built. As for Walt Disney World, once it's demolished, one half of it will be replaced with hentai clubs that also perform conversion therapy while the other half will be replaced with state prisons as Ron DeSantis always wanted. All Disney stores will be shut down immediately and give ways to anime stores instead.

It should also be remembered that far-right bullshitters on YouTube praised David Zaslav when he scrapped **Batgirl** because they perceived it as him waging war against ""woke garbages"". Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora will do the same thing for the entire upcoming Disney releases to appease those same far-right bullshitters and spite Iger/Feige and no one will be able to stop them since they will have the total control of Disney and its boards, meaning that they can just ignore shareholders even if they don't like any of those decisions that they pull off. Rermember, Peltz/Perlmutter would be CEOs and the board would be filled entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons.

I advise you all to read everything here carefully before making any rebuttals.

183kxvd_NFLX,NFLX,Disney needs to sell ESPN,"The world has changed and Disney needs to too.

Sports TV contracts were historically insulated from competition due to network effects.

The sporting brands could get the biggest money by selling to the companies with the widest viewership. Those with the widest viewership could afford to pay the most as they spread many fixed costs over high amounts of ad revenue.

While this dynamic hasn’t changed, the ability to monetize by the competition has. Amazon’s distribution network will allow them to pay more than others for sports rights as products and services will run ads and those that sell go through Amazon’s network. Also with linear TV you may know X million saw your ad, but on the stream you know who was logged in, and know which of the logged in people scanned the QR code. Maybe they didn’t buy the item, but they can retarget you next time you open the app. You were watching the game after all. Amazon gets paid for the Ad on the original TV and paid again to retarget the ad and then to deliver the item. How is Disney or anyone else supposed to compete with that?

If Disney sold ESPN the remainder of their business would be replicateable by competition (at least directly). There is only one Star Wars and they own the rights to the whole boat. Their model becomes purely turn IP into multiple avenues of growth.

It’s like the famous scene in Spaceballs, merchandising merchandising, spaceballs the flamethrower, the lunchbox and so on.

They can take their content creation and then license the good brand image to others.

I’m not the first to make this claim, but the case is getting stronger.

Extra:

Also I would consider selling all news networks. You can’t leverage ABC and turn it into other avenues of growth like a stuffed animal or a theme park location. It would not shock me that NFLX as it builds their library goes more and more into the licensing world without any of the legacy costs of Disney.",2023-11-25,231,264
1801xd4_DIS,DIS,"DIS, O & VZ saved my year!","Ended up making just under 6% dividend on my portfolio and around 9% growth for 2023. Cashed out on most of the risky ones. 

I tanked on T and lost about 7% of my portfolio but was able to sell that and buy DIS @ $84 a share. Was also able to buy VZ @ $33 a share and O @ $50 a share. Other notable was my MSFT (only 5 shares) did well in 2023 at over 20% growth. Also made nice dividend and growth on RITM. Over 13% growth plus the dividends.

I've mentioned this before here (and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/OptionsLearn/status/1721537375145271673)) that traders can be on the lookout for a few signs this week that the vega/gamma backdrop of the market has shifted on a dime. 0DTE expected moves of just 0.5% - 0.6% make sense (they were twice that last week when VIX was 22) if dips get bought, rallies find sellers etc. This would be a complete 180 from the steady declines we saw in October followed by the face rip higher we saw last week.

The first couple days of this week have indeed been low realized vol days (compared to the prior few weeks)  resulting in a slow grind higher in SPX QQQ etc. Some things to continue to watch when the market does finally go red, does that move get bought at about the expected move or does it plow right through to the downside? And do green days look more like slow grinds higher rather than the FOMO panic buying we saw last week? 

Market makers can get jammed with options after a VIX collapse. Here's how that works and why it can stop the market on a dime. The VIX was 22 going into last week. Market makers are sellers of options with the VIX 22, but they are not ""all in"" sellers because there's a chance IV goes higher on a market capitulation where they would want to really sell alot of vega with the VIX 30 or higher. With the market reversal higher last week they never got the chance to sell 30 VIX, and to add insult to injury, vol collapses so quickly they are getting sold options the entire rally, while the puts they sold at the lows are so quickly out of the money they no longer even register as short vega anymore. So out of nowhere they may be getting LONG options with the VIX 18-19. That loads the market with gamma and buyers of stock below and sellers of stock above (as all that premium needs to be scalped to cover theta. Market makers would then keep lowering vol across the board.

Those are the conditions where you can sometimes see a really low VIX as the day to day vol of the market gets crushed and alot of folks are choking on long straddles. 

Of course it is still earnings season, and we are seeing some very large moves in individual stocks. Today we hear from Disney among others (full list below). Powell's speech this morning is potentially market moving.

17qt99w_DIS,DIS,DIS Nov 17 81 Puts before earnings,Anyone have any thoughts on this potential earnings options strategy? There is talk of weak subscriber numbers and the underlying business has been having trouble lately. Also a history of price drop on earnings. I am not a good chart reader so I have to look at other metrics. There was a bunch of volume at this put strike. Just looking for some feedback. Trying to recoup from some painful losses so I am a bit trigger shy now. Can't hurt tooo much to ask those here for opinions. I know I will get a whole range of ideas but it is always nice to get a few more sets of eyes on something. TYVM,2023-11-08,0,3

17oplgf_RIVN,RIVN,"Expected Moves this Week: SPX, VIX, Disney, Trade Desk and more","&#x200B;

A very impressive rally in the market last week of nearly 6%. The SPX is now just 5% away from its July highs. With that move higher (and with the FOMC, Jobs number, and many of the mega-cap companies having now reported earnings) implied vol got smoked. The VIX fell from 22 to 15 in the past week, with options now pricing moves below historical averages into year-end. Options were pricing a nearly 7% move into year-end as of last week. Following the 6% rally in a week options have compressed to now pricing just a 4% move into Dec 29. Whether that was too far too fast for a falling VIX remains to be seen. As is often the case with a quick bounce in the market vol collapses so fast options really underprice the moves higher. That is until (if) the collapsing vol creates so much long gamma in the market it even slows moves higher into a slow grind.

This week will be one to watch for any change in that IV/Gamma backdrop. 0DTE moves in SPX are now just north of a half a percent a day for the upcoming week. That is down from the more than 1% daily moves options were pricing just a week ago. That's something to be cognizant of, especially those employing income from option strategies. Does the lower vol become self-fulfilling and do we start to see small moves day to day? Or did vol fall too far too fast, pricing in a year end slow grind through the Holidays a few weeks too early? We'll see.

**SPX**

* Expected move this week: 1.2%
* At the money IV: 11
* 0DTE expected moves: 0.6%
* Year end expected move: 3.7%
* Levels (roughly) 4200-4520

This week will be one to watch for any change in that IV/Gamma backdrop. 0DTE moves in SPX are now just north of a half a percent a day for the upcoming week. That is down from the more than 1% daily moves options were pricing just a week ago. That's something to be cognizant of, especially those employing income from option strategies. Does the lower vol become self-fulfilling and do we start to see small moves day to day? Or did vol fall too far too fast, pricing in a year end slow grind through the Holidays a few weeks too early? We'll see.

if certain weekdays show **higher volume, prioritize trading on those days** over ones with lower volume. in this report, Thursday's and Friday's have the highest average volume.

if volume is even throughout the week, **prioritize trading on the days with the highest range**. in this report, Thursday's and Friday's have the highest average range.

I never thought they’d fire the character playing the main character. To me this signals that they (finally) actually listened to their audience and understand that the majority don’t stand behind the woke agenda. To me this seems bullish and that they finally might start making good content without an agenda and actually focus on the storytelling and bring back fans and bring in new ones as well. 

This is at a time where Disney is trading at its lowest in years. I know that their main stream of revenue is their parks, cruises, merch and so on but at least this signals to me that there’s been a turning point in management?",2023-09-28,0,131

I’m just a retail investor and mostly invest long but is there any light at the end of the tunnel or should I cut my losses? When I bought it I thought with all the IPs they own I’d at least make a steady predictable slow gain but instead it’s been a dog. 

Is it superhero fatigue? Is it the price of the parks? Is it because they pumped out too many Star Wars movies? Is it because Disney + is a giant black hole? Maybe it’s because they’ve inserted themselves in the culture wars? 

I just don’t see a positive future and wondering if I should cut my losses or hold on? I just don’t want to be left holding the bag and if I do hold on how long do you think it will take?

16blai8_META,META,$DIS looks like it's about to pull off a META recovery,"DIS has been lately under fire for it's agenda and lack of ideas, their movies are crap, has difficulty getting people to their parks because drum rolls their movies are crap.

The Star wars was a fiasco with a lot of potential.

I think people have been heard, their wallets spoke really loud.

Now what? META went through something similar, people hated the multiverse diversityverse? rick&MortyVerse... And the stock drop spoke volumes. Zuck the cuck only needed to say he will make the year of efficiency, stopped a little bit investing in the metaverse and boom, stock soared. 

If the CEO and the board members have at least 2 eye balls in their cranium, they will shift tactics pretty soon. They can't lose invetors money and trust.

What kind of shift investors might like? Investing in better writers, leave politics to the politics, stop remakes, hire star wars entusiasts, take their time to conjure a great movie (Darth Bane story) should do the kicker or maybe explore the past instead of continue with weak ideas post Originals.

Disney can still make a new movie like Frozen capturing the young generations That I have no doubt.

162k6ez_DIS,DIS,Disney - earnings discussion,"DIS has made the decision to further up its streaming monetization efforts by adopting paid sharing starting in 2024, following NFLX's lead. These price increases come on top of those for Hulu and Disney+ Premium (ad-free) that will increase by 20% and 30%, respectively, starting in October 2023. While these initiatives may accelerate the company's top and bottom-line growth, it is still unclear whether they will be able to increase Disney+'s dwindling US streaming market share to 13% by Q2 of 23.   
Long-term, the well-diversified entertainment options provided by DIS, including ESPN and sports betting, across resorts, theme parks, cruises, and streaming, might be a real franchise flywheel. Able to set itself apart from rivals and preserve an alluring value proposition for clients. Disney and Apple have a number of intriguing partnerships for the Vision Pro spatial headset, which will feature Disney+ streaming video and immersive 4D gaming experiences. Although the headset won't be available until early 2024, the media company will probably benefit from its strong IP portfolio and increasingly varied revenue prospects.   
Netflix, unlike Disney, has not yet increased pricing, but it has also subtly discontinued the cheapest ad-free package, thereby increasing overall subscription and advertisement profits. Since more customers are likely to switch to ad-supported rates as a result of less discretionary spending, an elevated interest rate environment, and increased ad-free streaming plans, these moves are undoubtedly deliberate.  
However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+'s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase). The increased prices could likely result in more churn and market share losses, increasing the stock's volatility during the ensuing two quarters.

Adding the Hollywood strike on top of that, it just seems like a recipe for disaster. Should I cut my losses now and put the money into an index fund instead?

14ykp9q_IBM,IBM,Disney could soon sell its TV assets as Iger says business ‘may not be core’ to the company,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/disney-ceo-iger-opens-door-to-unloading-tv-assets.html

Disney CEO Bob Iger opened the door to selling the company’s linear TV assets as the business struggles during the media industry’s transition to streaming and digital offerings. Iger appeared on CNBC on Thursday, the morning after the company announced it would extend his contract by two years through 2026. He returned to the helm of the company in November after Disney’s board ousted Bob Chapek with a two-year contract through 2024 and plans to find a next successor. “After coming back, I realized the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self inflicted,” Iger told CNBC’s Faber on Thursday, noting he’s accomplished a lot of work in seven months but there’s more to be done.

At the top of the list is assessing the traditional TV business, Iger said on Thursday. Disney owns a portfolio of TV networks, from broadcast station ABC to cable-TV channels like ESPN.  Disney is going to be “expansive” in its thinking about the traditional TV business, leaving the door open to a possible sale of the networks. “They may not be core to Disney,” Iger said, adding the creativity that has come from those networks has been key for Disney.  Cable-TV channel ESPN is in a different bucket, however. On that front, Iger said Disney is open to finding a strategic partner, which could take the form of a joint venture or offloading an ownership stake. 

Iger said when he had left the company he had predicted the future of traditional TV and had been “very pessimistic,” and has found since his return that he was right in his thinking, adding it’s worse than he expected. When Iger last spoke with Faber in February, soon after announcing a major restructuring at the company, he said he felt “a sense of obligation” to return to Disney and that his preference was to stay for his two-year contract. “We’ve gotten a lot done very quickly, significant cost reductions and significant realignment of the company,” Iger said. “But dealing head on with some of our biggest challenges.”",2023-07-13,604,252

14pgu89_TGT,TGT,Selling puts on $DIS,"Hi

I'm new to the subreddit and this is my first post but I'd like to hear your thoughts on my options play.

Disney is now trading at around $90 per share and I think it's a good idea to sell OTM (for example $60-65 strike) $DIS put expiring in a few years. I think it's a good idea because of a few things:

1- $DIS has tested the $85 support time and time again

2- I think its involvement in politics has hurt its market, similar to $BUD and $TGT, and while it effects revenue, Disney still has many assets to justify the valuation

3- I think even if the put gets exercised, buying $DIS at a price like $60-65 is a good bargain. The reason for that strike price is to collect the most premium, while still being quiet confident that it won't get exercised, but also even if it did, it would be a bargain to buy

4- Because of the perception of $DIS, which is result of its involvement with political controversies and legal battle with DeSantis, there is good premium for $DIS puts to collect. For example $DIS 65 put 12/19/25 collects around $400 premium for a $6.5k collateral.

5- With the price of $DIS being around its tested support of $85, it is likely to go up again. It has been moving around between the $85 and $100 range, and selling the put now allows for buying it back again later at a cheaper price.

14pgu89_DE,DE,Selling puts on $DIS,"Hi

I'm new to the subreddit and this is my first post but I'd like to hear your thoughts on my options play.

Disney is now trading at around $90 per share and I think it's a good idea to sell OTM (for example $60-65 strike) $DIS put expiring in a few years. I think it's a good idea because of a few things:

1- $DIS has tested the $85 support time and time again

2- I think its involvement in politics has hurt its market, similar to $BUD and $TGT, and while it effects revenue, Disney still has many assets to justify the valuation

3- I think even if the put gets exercised, buying $DIS at a price like $60-65 is a good bargain. The reason for that strike price is to collect the most premium, while still being quiet confident that it won't get exercised, but also even if it did, it would be a bargain to buy

4- Because of the perception of $DIS, which is result of its involvement with political controversies and legal battle with DeSantis, there is good premium for $DIS puts to collect. For example $DIS 65 put 12/19/25 collects around $400 premium for a $6.5k collateral.

5- With the price of $DIS being around its tested support of $85, it is likely to go up again. It has been moving around between the $85 and $100 range, and selling the put now allows for buying it back again later at a cheaper price. For instance in the past month, it had a move between $94 and $88, which resultsed in the option to move between 3.88 and 4.48.

14jk8w1_DIS,DIS,$DIS is looking good for a long call,"Let me explain from a technical and fundamental analysis standpoint why I think Disney stock is ready for a long call, preferably at the $100 strike, Jan 2025, but first look at my crayons before I explain...

[My crayons on $DIS chart](https://preview.redd.it/yhkdkp5bod8b1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef891ee8ca7bab96ed7876aa282f5a3cec480e74)

Now basically disney stock has been getting beaten down hard while the rest of the market parties, now you might think yeah it's gonna go lower, get fucked. But this is disney were talking about, they are simply to big to get fucked. Now you might be saying OO they've been losing money and they are going to keep losing money. And you know you'd be right, but you have to buy stocks when everyone else doesn't want them, I mean no one wanted Meta when Zuck was fucking up with VR shit and losing BILLIONS, or Tesla when Elon was buying Twitter and cutting prices, or even banks like Western Allegiance or Pacwest when bank stocks were getting fucked hard, but if you bought then when it seemed like an obvious throw of money, well you'd of bought at the bottom.

So now I saw this, doesn't this look similar, doesn't everyone think Disney is fucked, yes obviously, would you seem like a regard for going long on it, yes of course, but fundamentally Disney has been around for about a hundred years and it's not going anywhere, so for a well known company like that I think this price is very fair, now could it go lower, maybe in the mid 80's. But this is absolutely a turning point, it's struggling to even go any lower and from a technical standpoint it's very difficult for disney to fall lower from this level. Why, because at some point investors realize a price is so low they know it's a discount and they are gonna keep buying. and besides my crayons saying that this is a good buying point, I think that disney understands better now what works and doesn't for their films and over time this lesson will translate to billions of dollars in profit.

Now as for the trade, well as you know disney is very oversold and at a strong demand zone that keeps it from falling lower, with the market already having fallen so much I think it's fair to say that if you are a bull and believe the market will go up then it's fair to say that disney will get some of that upside, and even if you are a bear in the market you must acknowledge disney's ability to not go lower in price, indicating that this is a strong bottom, so even if you are bearish or bullish on the market it doesn't fucking matter because disney is for sure going to do one thing, and that is GO UP.

I think the safest and best way to go about this trade would be as said previously to buy some Jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options, because even if you aren't certain disney will go up in the near term or do well as a company, you can at least be certain that some point in 1 and a half years it will have a technical bounce and those calls will print at least a 20% gain

TLDR: Get disney Jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options because it's technicals are very bullish and it's likely to bounce as well as fundamentally the fact that when companies are doing shit they are a great buy with low downside risk, especially when they have clearly bottomed out like disney",2023-06-26,201,228
14hdvkr_DE,DE,Why I sold my Disney stocks,"Wrote this as a comment in response to another disney post, but I thought it'd be good as it's own post.

I sold my disney stock because I feel the brand has not only grown fat and lazy, no longer trying anything new or bold, but in doing so they're going to lose their audiences. 

Let me explain

Marvel put a lot of overpriced projects into production, thinking they'd maintain their current box office status, but audiences have wised up, and we're seeing ip alone can't sell a movie anymore, and WOM matters again, see guardians and antman 3. I feel as if they got a lot of freebies, but unless there's good word of mouth for their projects, they won't perform amazingly at the box office, and their budgets are insane so they sort of have to if they want to be profitable. Marvel has a lot of shows already planned out, and many movies still in production at varying stages, with the writers strike I really feel like they can't fix the poorly written ones before release with reshoots.

Star wars Is an insane ip, but what are they doing with it? Only mandalorian has been massively successful, and the new trilogy soured public perception, and all the movies they've announced have been getting canceled or delayed indefinitely. Imo star wars could have a movie every 2 years but it's embarrassing they've repeatedly canceled stuff they're already announced, from TV, to movies.

Also willow was apparently so bad it was removed from d+ and Indiana jones 5 was rotten? Lucasfilms needs new management at least.

The live action remakes seemed to just be easy money printing, but the little mermaid showed that not only is it not the same anymore, not even a disney princess as iconic as Ariel is a draw. 

Elementals isn't doing well apparently and carries a hefty budget.

As far as animation, they've cheapened their brands with streaming, the budgets are too high, quality mixed, and DreamWorks, illumination, sony, and even Netflix are running circles around them with animation, with cheaper budgets. Puss in boots having fantastic legs and doing better than lightyear is hilarious. Not to mention Mario's success clearly shows there still is a market for animation in theaters, just not Disney's.

Finally, parks, imo, having grown up in Florida, Disney parks have declined in quality. Fast pass costs money, lines are absolutely horrendous, and every extra experience costs money. I feel like whenever I go I have to rigorously plan my day, and still it's mostly spent in line. Also I feel like there's very little new rides or attractions. Also the prices for rides are crazy. I've been to Disney sea in Japan, the only park not owned by Disney and it was phenomenal, Shanghai left a lot to be desired and Disney owns it. Also ticket prices are increasingly constantly with Less value imo.

Compare that to universal orlando that's been trying to have a new attraction every year, put out some bangers in the recent years with bourne, velocicoaster, and Hagrids, the tickets are cheaper, but most importantly the lines are manageable and I can just pop in on non peak days and do everything I'd like with no planning or preparation, which would be an impossibility with Disney. 
Harry Potter showed that universal can be competition, and with the new park I think they finally might be a true challenger for orlando.

Not to mention Mario as we've seen is wildly popular, but if universal ever has Pokémon in their parks? Game over Disney.

Also DeSantis is literally threatening Disney constantly, doesn't seem safe.

Unless Disney seriously overhauls some things, I don't see them getting better, I just see everyone else filling the vacuum and Disney becoming less of a powerhouse.


Also I've got no actual professional experience, im just a florida local, and like following entertainment, you probably shouldn't give too much thought to any of this, because I could be wrong about stuff or just misunderstanding. I don't think I am, but hey, fair warning.

Edit: I wanna say I sold before the recent low, just made this in response to another post about Disney. And Yeah, with my luck it'll probably go up a lot after I sold, so you're welcome for that. I was just sharing my thoughts about the position of the company. Never meant this to be my recommendation, just my own thoughts, I'm a dumb kid, y'all can stop commenting it.",2023-06-23,178,274

13kvyir_DIS,DIS,Disney (DIS) DCF UPDATED.,"# Introduction:

I did a DCF during Bob Chapek's reign and now during Bob Iger's reign, I think DIS is a lemon not because of how badly the company is ran but rather the industry that DIS is in. In this new DCF, I gave my opinion on certain arms of the business and even made assumptions that DIS will pivot fast enough into greener pastures. But even that didn't save the value of this company. Not to mention, this company utterly sucks at reporting their financials so a fair bit of simplifying assumptions had to be made. I've linked my old DCF if you'd like to read it but I'll tear apart why my old DCF was wrong in the end. Old DCF: ([SOURCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zvn7if/disneydis_dcf_analysis_need_advice_and_criticisms/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))  


# REVENUE:

  
DMED (%REV)  
  
The emphasis on DMED will eventually fade away, linear network seems to be phasing out in popularity as it’s mainly being held up by Gen X and Baby Boomers ([SOURCE](https://morningconsult.com/2023/03/28/linear-tv-viewership-gen-z-millennials/)), The average life expectancy is 72 years ([SOURCE](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators)). So DIS will pivot away from Linear Network, as evident by management's heavy emphasis on DIS+ especially during conference calls. “About 50% of this demographic is expected to cut the cord by 2025” ([SOURCE](https://www.brid.tv/what-is-linear-tv/)). So I’m assuming it has a half life of about 3 years. But, given Linear Network contributes 25% of Revenue in FY22 it may not drop to a very large extent so I’m assuming it plateaus at about 23%.  
  
DMED (Y/Y)  
Given how volatile to changes DMED is for the duration of my forecast, I used a historic number when forecasting DMED. Believing that 2022’s Linear TV trend will continue.  
  
  
DPEP (%REV)  
DPEP will plateau at a level slightly below pre disney+ levels of 2017 and 2018, as Disney+ begins taking up larger portions of the revenue.  
  
DPEP (Y/Y)  
The largest 4 theme parks in the US and UK had an average CAGR of 4.93% for the last 10 years. (SOURCE). However, with the advent of more entertainment and more addictive kind e.g. Tiktok or VR, I’d say this trend is unlikely to continue for the next 10 years. The growth tend downwards.   
  
  
  
  
DTC (%REV)  
DTC will begin taking up a larger portion of its revenue as it takes over some of the role played by linear network and as DTC has a much wider reach than Linear Network e.g. Able to reach mobile phones instead of being fixed on television, very valuable in countries where television is expensive (See success of NFLX in APAC). DTC makes portions of Linear Network obsolete.  
  
DTC (Y/Y)  
Management has stated its goal is to make DTC profitable by end 2024, I project that it will reach this goal. I’ve done the calculation and DTC will maintain this pace in accordance with the pace that NFLX is growing at as well, given that the streaming industry is an oligopoly one.

# 

# COST:

COST OF SERVICES  
Most of disney services have variable costs e.g. Theme Parks having to expand more to take on higher capacity or DTC having to pay more for bandwidth as more customers subscribe, and DIS has to constantly maintain production in order to remain attractive for existing subscribers.   
  
COST OF PRODUCTS  
As DIS gets more popular, they produce more merchandise in bulk which could lead to economies of scale. So the cost of products falls over time.  
  
SG&A  
Utilities are a variable cost, whereas rent is a fixed cost so increasing capacity has higher marginal benefit. I’d argue that SG&A falls slightly over time as DIS approaches its capacity limits.

# Conclusion:

I've valued DIS at $69.38. With so much of their revenue in an outdated system, it's like a time bomb waiting to go off. What's worse is that most of DIS' cost are variable cost which means that they increase as o/p increases so margins are more or less fixed in place. It's hard for me to see how DIS could potentially dig themselves out of this. The plus side is that they are generating positive cash flow so hope is definitely there.  


Now, my old DCF is inaccurate because I did not capitalize content acquisition costs so that did not accurately reflect the nature of content acquisition. In perpetuity, I'm assuming that D&A > CapEX which is impossible as you can't depreciate more than the par value of a PP&E. I've just done the math but for my terminal year to hold I need to earn a ROE of 522%, beyond ridiculous. Terminal Year Y/Y is at 8% which is significantly beyond TGR.

Primary takeaways -

* Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in Q2 2023, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop.
* However, the company narrowed its streaming business losses by $400 million YoY.
* The sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia.
* In the US/Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subscribers while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.
* Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.
* Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”
* Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”
* Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Products group saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion.
* The company's Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion.
* Disney's content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.

Disney+ shed another 4 million subscribers in the first three months of 2023, marking the streamer’s second consecutive quarterly drop after closing 2022 with its first-ever decline. On the bright side, the Mouse House also managed to narrow its streaming business losses by $400 million, down 26% year over year.

On Wednesday, CEO Bob Iger and Co. beat Wall Street estimates for Disney’s quarterly earnings and revenue due to an impressive January-March showing at the company’s theme parks. That win comes during a fiscal Q2, which concluded April 1, plagued by company-wide layoffs, a looming (and now active) writers strike and a turf war with Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis.

Disney ended the quarter with 157.8 million subscribers at Disney+, significantly missing Wall Street’s estimate of 163.17 million subs. That projected figured would have been up from the 161.8 million subs Disney+ fell to the prior quarter.

This second sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, Disney lost streaming rights to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches, which prompted it to lower growth targets for Disney+ Hotstar in India.

In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subs (to reach 46.3 million), while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.

Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.

During Disney’s earnings call with analysts later Wednesday, Iger — who returned to his post as CEO last fall upon the ousting of Bob Chapek — announced that Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”

Also on the call, CFO Christine McCarthy announced Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”

According to McCarthy, Disney expects a writedown in Q3 of $1.5-$1.8 billion from removing the content. McCarthy also said “going forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.”

The content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.

Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents on $21.78 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Disney reported adjusted EPS of 93 cents on $21.82 billion in revenue.

Disney posted negative free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter.

Starting with its fiscal Q2 2022, Disney restructured its financial results into two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion — which was better than analysts forecasted.

At Disney’s linear TV networks, revenue dropped 7% to $6.6 billion, and operating income decreased 35% to $1.8 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s domestic TV channels business, which include ABC and ESPN, decreased 4% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 33% to $1.6 billion. The drop in operating income was attributable to lower ad revenue and higher sports programming and production costs.

International channels’ revenue for the quarter dropped 18% to $1.1 billion and operating income fell 65% to $85 million.

The brightest spot for Disney in the quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products group, which saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion, reflecting increased guest spending at international and domestic parks and experiences (primarily at Disney’s international parks and resorts).

Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues, which includes box office revenue, increased 18% to $2.2 billion and saw an operating loss of of $50 million, down from an increase of $16 million year over year.

Per Disney, “the improvement at theatrical distribution was due to the continued success of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which was released in the first quarter of the current year, partially offset by the comparison to co-production income in the prior-year quarter from Marvel’s ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home.’ The current quarter included the release of ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ whereas the prior-year quarter included the release of ‘Death on the Nile.'”

Disney stock closed Wednesday at $101.14 per share. The regular U.S. stock markets will reopen Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET.",2023-05-11,468,131

In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subs (to reach 46.3 million), while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.

Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.

During Disney’s earnings call with analysts later Wednesday, Iger — who returned to his post as CEO last fall upon the ousting of Bob Chapek — announced that Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”

Also on the call, CFO Christine McCarthy announced Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”

According to McCarthy, Disney expects a writedown in Q3 of $1.5-$1.8 billion from removing the content. McCarthy also said “going forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.”

The content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.

Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents on $21.78 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Disney reported adjusted EPS of 93 cents on $21.82 billion in revenue.

Disney posted negative free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter.

Starting with its fiscal Q2 2022, Disney restructured its financial results into two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion — which was better than analysts forecasted.

At Disney’s linear TV networks, revenue dropped 7% to $6.6 billion, and operating income decreased 35% to $1.8 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s domestic TV channels business, which include ABC and ESPN, decreased 4% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 33% to $1.6 billion. The drop in operating income was attributable to lower ad revenue and higher sports programming and production costs.

International channels’ revenue for the quarter dropped 18% to $1.1 billion and operating income fell 65% to $85 million.

The brightest spot for Disney in the quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products group, which saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion, reflecting increased guest spending at international and domestic parks and experiences (primarily at Disney’s international parks and resorts).

Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues, which includes box office revenue, increased 18% to $2.2 billion and saw an operating loss of of $50 million, down from an increase of $16 million year over year.

Per Disney, “the improvement at theatrical distribution was due to the continued success of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which was released in the first quarter of the current year, partially offset by the comparison to co-production income in the prior-year quarter from Marvel’s ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home.’ The current quarter included the release of ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ whereas the prior-year quarter included the release of ‘Death on the Nile.'”

Disney stock closed Wednesday at $101.14 per share. The regular U.S. stock markets will reopen Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET.",2023-05-11,1077,256

1228i2x_DIS,DIS,Why Disney (DIS) is a no brainer buy right now," Disney owns timeless characters and brands that have been entertaining people for decades. After a decade of great returns for shareholders, the stock didn't have the best outing last year, falling about 44%. But with Disney's streaming business continuing to gain new subscribers and the company's theme parks benefiting from a pickup in travel, the future looks bright for the Magic Kingdom. 

Disney+ core subscriber count ended calendar 2023 at 104 million, excluding the international Hotstar service. That is tremendous growth since the service launched in 2019, thanks to a seemingly never-ending pipeline of Star Wars and Marvel content.

Meanwhile, Disney's theme parks are performing exceptionally well. The parks, experiences, and products segment reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter. Operating profits grew even faster at 25%, reflecting solid operating leverage and digital initiatives at the parks to improve the guest experience and lift margins. 

Disney has a strong lineup of films and original series this year, including a new *Indiana Jones* film, *The Little Mermaid*, and season three of *The Mandalorian* on Disney+. The recent release of *Avatar: The Way of Water* was the fourth-biggest launch of all time, bringing in $2.2 billion at the box office. Disney is wasting no time capitalizing on *Avatar*'s popularity by announcing a new *Avatar* experience coming to Disneyland.

Disney has been turning success at the box office into a lucrative stream of revenue for decades. It has literally thousands of characters across all its franchises that it can mine for years of entertainment. With the stock trading about 50% off its highs, now is a  great time to buy the stock before the market changes its mind. ",2023-03-26,0,79

**Last Week – QQQ led the way**

SPY rallied 1.6% last week, inside the expected move of 2%. Weekly IV was higher for the week to account for the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday, the Jobs number, and earnings reports from the likes of Apple, Alphabet Amazon and more. The majority of the market volatility occurred into and out of the FOMC event. So despite the final tally being less than what options were pricing the week featured a 4.5% rally from the lows of the week to the highs.

The QQQ was where the majority of the action was, finishing higher by about 3.4% on the week (versus a 2.8% expected move). The VIX was down slightly to 18.30, the lowest it has been in the past year. The next bit of a pop in IV this month is around the 14th for the next CPI where SPY IV pops from 14 to 17 (as seen on the expected move chart below). However, the CPI is becoming less of a market-moving event (in the eyes of option vol, as 17 IV is not high at all compared to recent months). In other words, even the CPI isn’t enough to get people too geeked up on expensive options:

As mentioned, last week had a ton of news to absorb. Overall the market was pleased, despite the fact that stocks had already rallied into the FOMC and big tech earnings, which could have set the stage for a sell-the-news week. Amazon and Alphabet gave up some of their recent gains on Friday following disappointing earnings reports, but that wasn't even enough to cause a major market pullback. And looking specifically at Amazon, its 8% decline on earnings wasn't even enough to take the stock down on the week. It finished up 1% on the week because its rally into earnings was more than its sell-off after.

Then there's Meta, which options weren't even close to getting right, finishing the week higher by 23% and is now up 105% from its November lows. Meta isn't alone, there are tons of stocks that have rallied massively off their 2022 lows. Netflix is +120% since last Summer. Shopify is up 100% since October. Even left-for-dead stocks like Peloton have found buyers, up 100% in 2023.

These types of bullish moves are something to be aware of if IV continues to decline. The rally in markets the past month has crushed IV, yet a lot of stocks can make large percentage moves higher. The math on how options can get caught sleeping on moves higher from lows is obvious. Shopify is a great example, declining 85% from its highs to its 2022 lows. That was a -$125 or so move lower. But from those lows, a move of just $25 higher is a 100% rally. So option traders need to recalibrate sometimes following the sort of wreckage we saw in 2022. For SHOP to rally +$25 from its lows is a 100% move higher, despite being nowhere near to recovering its massive decline last year. 

Just as another example, take SNAP. Options are pricing about a 14% move for the next month. But just in the last week, it had both a move higher and lower of 15%, more than options are pricing 30 days out from now. In dollar terms these moves are nothing since the stock is now just $11 (from a high of $40+. For instance, a 100% rally off its lows wouldn't even get the stock to 50% off its highs. These type of dollar cheap potential moves are something to keep in mind if trading low IV options in a beaten down stock, as a stock rallying 100% off its lows is not uncommon, despite options not even close to pricing the possibility.

The math on how options can get caught sleeping on moves higher from lows is obvious. Shopify is a great example, declining 85% from its highs to its 2022 lows. That was a -$125 or so move lower. But from those lows, a move of just $25 higher is a 100% rally. So option traders need to recalibrate sometimes following the sort of wreckage we saw in 2022. For SHOP to rally +$25 from its lows is a 100% move higher, despite being nowhere near to recovering its massive decline last year. 

Just as another example, take SNAP. Options are pricing about a 14% move for the next month. But just in the last week, it had both a move higher and lower of 15%, more than options are pricing 30 days out from now. In dollar terms these moves are nothing since the stock is now just $11 (from a high of $40+. For instance, a 100% rally off its lows wouldn't even get the stock to 50% off its highs. These type of dollar cheap potential moves are something to keep in mind if trading low IV options in a beaten down stock, as a stock rallying 100% off its lows is not uncommon, despite options not even close to pricing the possibility.

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3.3% last week, erasing most of the gains made the week before. The majority of the move lower came immediately after a slightly more hawkish-than-expected press conference from Jay Powell following the FOMC rate change and statement. The market rallied on Friday and kept last week’s selloff from being even worse.

The 3.3% move lower was more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. The market has been moving more than options were pricing fairly consistently over the past month. Despite that, vol continued to trend lower, with many of the big earnings reports, plus the FOMC decision now out of the way. However, the election looms this week and that could keep a bid on options for the next few days. 30 day IV in SPY is about 24, with realized vol (actually moves) over the past month around 27. (for reference, realized vol for the past year is around 23, so 27 the past month means the market is volatile, even for 2022)

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of about $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 25. Its lowest levels since mid-September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher. The reasons why are numerous and unimportant is some ways, but from a trading perspective, it means that debit call spreads that buy ATM and sell upside strikes are more favorable than they have been in recent weeks (not to mention they are lower IV overall).

The economic calendar this week has an important CPI number, and of course, the mid-term elections are on Tuesday, with reactions beginning with Wednesday’s session.

y0szgb_DIS,DIS,What to do with Disney!?!? (DIS),"Been a long time investor in Disney stock, back when they had the dividend. As the stock went up these past two years, it slowly brought up my average as I DCA every week. Now I’m down 30% and have been holding all year long. This is one of my biggest losers. I honestly like the business models, brands, streaming, and the management is ehh, but I don’t see the stock making my money back for a couple more years. The dividend hasn’t been reinstated so I feel I’m not earning anything holding and I feel I could use the money from Disney and average down my more confident holdings like Costco and Microsoft.

**Share price performance & dividends**

If we take a look at the last 5 years, the performance isn't great, down 7%, way below the S&P500 performance. Up until mid-2020, the company was a dividend-payer, so if we take the dividends into account, the return would be close to -2%. As of mid-2020, due to the pandemic, they've decided to change their dividend policy and stop paying dividends. In case the company decides to go back to paying dividends, the yield would be somewhere around 2% (based on the current share price).

&#x200B;

**The two main divisions**

The company is currently organized into two divisions and understanding each one is important before we can make any rational/informed assumptions about the future.

**Disney media & entertainment distribution - Division #1**

This is their largest division contribution almost 70% of the total revenue. It grew from a bit over $30b in the financial year 2017\* to over $50b in the last twelve months ending March 2022.

*\*Disney's financial years end in September and start in October the year before.* 

However, in the same time, the operating margin of the division is down from 30% to 10%. To better understand that, we need to go one layer deeper. This division has three main segments

**a) Linear Networks** (ABC, Disney, ESPN, National Geographic, Star) with an average operating margin of 31% in the last 5 years

**b) Direct-to-consumer** (Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Star+) with an average operating margin of -17% in the last 5 years

**c) Content sales/Licensing** (theatrical distribution, home entertainment (DVD/Blu-ray), Music distribution) with an average operating margin of 30% in the last 5 years

Now, we all know the streaming war going on with Netflix and Amazon Prime and Apple Plus TV, and Disney/Hulu. Direct-to-consumer stream is the reason behind the decrease in the operating margin of this segment. It has grown significantly in the last 4 years and since it has a negative operating margin, it brings down the margin of the entire division. Of course, the margin has been improving over time.

So, what can we expect from this division in the long run? The Linear Networks and the Content sales/licensing are both relatively mature segments with limited growth ahead, but high margins. The direct-to-consumer is high growth in terms of revenue, but the margin is yet to catch up. Looking into all the competitors, I don't see any chance that the operating margin gets anywhere close to the 30%. So in my forecast, I feel comfortable using a 25% long-term operating margin. What this means is I'm starting with the 10% and slowly increasing that over time.

**Disney parks, experiences, and products - Division #2**

This division contributes the remaining 30% of the revenue and it is related to the theme parks (Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai), Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club, National geographic expeditions, Disney resort, and spa. Not only that, but here is also the revenue that Disney earns by licensing trade names, characters, visuals, and other IP to manufacturers, game developers, and publishers, as well as the sale of branded merchandise.

This is the division that got impacted significantly in 2020. The revenue went from $23b in 2017 to $26b in 2019 down to $17b in 2020 and $16.5b in 2021. Not only that, but the margins went down from 24-25% to under 3%.

As the world is going back to normal, this division is recovering as well, the LTM sales are almost $24b and the operating margin is at 22%. This amazing recovery in such a short period of time indicates the strong brand around the company.

**Historical financial performance**

If we look at the annual report, the combined financials are not equal to the sum of the two divisions. When looking into the individual divisions, what's not taken into account are the restructuring expenses that Disney had (over $5b in 2020 due to the pandemic) that are not allocated to any division to provide a better view and not distort the division's profitability. The same goes for the goodwill impairment and certain expenses that are related to the 21st Century Fox and Hulu acquisitions. 

The balance sheet doubled in size in the last 5 years (roughly from $100b to $200b) majority of that due to the acquisitions ($50b goodwill, $10b other intangible assets) and their investments in content assets (>$20b)

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is quite clear how this was financed as there's a significant increase in debt of over $30b and there's a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding (from 1.5b to 1.8b).

&#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value. The assumptions are listed below:

**Revenue growth:** 15% for the next 12 months, followed by 6% in the 4 years after that and declining over time to 2.91%. The analysts are forecasting roughly 23% for 2022 and 12% for 2023. However, as the last public data is up until Q1/2022 (which is half of the financial year 2022 for Disney), part of this growth is already in the financials and included in my starting point.

**Operating margin**: Looking into the various divisions, a long-term target of 25% seems reasonable. Of course, this is highly dependent on the recovery of the DPEP division (which is on track) and the profitability of their Direct-to-consumer segment. In my model, I'm expecting the margin to increase slowly over time, reaching 25% in 8 years.

**Discount rate**: Currently 8.37% (based on WACC) increasing to 9.64% over time (also due to the fact that the FED is raising the interest rate)

**Outcome**: $89.4 (Current share price $96.08)

\*Note: In the DCF calculation, the outstanding equity options and the minority interest are also taken into account.

&#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions stated above, the revenue will grow by 78% to $138.1b in the next 10 years and the operating margin will reach 25%.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) changes based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

|Revenue / Op. margin|23%|25%|27%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|70% ($132.0b)|$78.4|$87.0|$95.5|
|78% ($138.1b)|$80.5|$89.4|$98.3|
|110% ($163.1b)|$94.6|$105.0|$115.4|
|140% ($186.4b)|$106.7|$118.4|$130.2|

It is worth mentioning that historically, Disney has almost always traded at a premium over the intrinsic value as it is seen as a bit more safe investment due to the brand behind it.

She added: “In this important time of growth and transformation, the Board is committed to keeping Disney on the successful path it is on today, and Bob’s leadership is key to achieving that goal.

vm5ern_DE,DE,Disney's Granddaughter Poised to Mount Shareholder Battle Over Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s $32.5 Million Salary,"This story is about a week old, however I've not seen anyone talking about this.

[Full article from New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/06/21/abigail-disney-wants-to-challenge-bob-chapeks-pay-report/):

Abigail Disney, the Mouse House heiress turned vocal critic, is reportedly attempting to organize a shareholder challenge of embattled Disney boss Bob Chapek’s $32.5 million payday.

Disney, who has pegged her personal net worth at $120 million, has been “quietly courting” institutional investors to challenge Chapek’s compensation at the company’s next shareholder meeting, The Wrap reported, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.

The proxy push could mark another embarrassment for Chapek, who has been under fire following a series of missteps at the entertainment giant.

The 62-year-old heiress has reportedly held at least three meetings in an effort to build support for the move, through which participants would reject or potentially seek to claw back some of Chapek’s pay. She has argued that her name recognition would provide the company’s shareholders with a better chance in the fight at the meeting, which will be held next spring.

One unnamed institutional investor approached by Disney reportedly described their meeting as a “very informal discussion that was very serious,” while another investor told The Wrap that the discussion was preliminary in nature.

“Fund managers run into each other at industry events all the time and talk shop,” the investor told the outlet. “And Abigail wanted to know what they thought, what the mood was. She seemed mostly interested in if this was that perfect opportunity for something like this.”

Both a Disney spokesperson and Abigail Disney declined The Wrap’s request for comment on the report.

The Post has reached out to Disney and Abigail Disney’s production company, Fork Films, for further comment.

Chapek, who replaced Bob Iger as Disney CEO in 2020, has faced intense criticism over the botched response to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. One former Disney executive reportedly said that the company’s leadership “managed to piss off both the left and the right’ by flip-flopping in reaction to the legislation.

The Chapek-led company faced internal protests from left-leaning workers as well as a public spat with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who revoked the company’s special tax status. The incident sparked speculation that Iger could return to replace Chapek as Disney’s top boss.

More recently, Chapek shocked the entertainment world by firing Disney’s well-regarded TV content executive Peter Rice – a move that reportedly led to “terrible” morale at the Mouse House. Still, Disney Chairman Susan Arnold issued a vote of confidence for Chapek in the wake of that decision.

Disney’s stock has also struggled, sinking 40% during a broader downturn in the market since January and about 46% over the last 12 months.

Abigail Disney’s behind-the-scenes push is the latest sign of her willingness to criticize the company founded by her grandfather, Roy O. Disney.

The heiress co-directed a documentary entitled “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales,” which called out pay inequality at Disney. Released earlier this year, the film highlighted the struggles of park workers compared to the lifestyle of Iger, who earned $65.6 million in 2018.

Abigail Disney also has a history of criticizing executive pay at Disney – once referring to Iger’s windfall in 2018 as “insane.” At the time, Equilar determined that Iger earned 1,424 times the pay of the median Disney employees.

Chapek’s 2021 compensation of $32.5 million more than doubled his pay from the previous year. The sum included a $10.2 million stock award and $14.3 million through an incentive plan. His contract is due t expire next year.

Shareholder challenges of CEO compensation are relatively common, particularly at large companies, but rarely result in material changes.

The votes are typically non-binding and function as recommendations to a company’s board – though they can be a powerful rebuke and indication of public sentiment about internal management.""",2022-06-27,2146,246

Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet are set for 20-1 stock splits in the beginning of June, less than a month from now. With both stocks currently near $2300, that would mean a roughly $115 price for each post-split. A recent CBOE study showed that large-cap stocks tend to see initially increased (split-adjusted) volume, volatility, and implied volatility but that effect tapers off over time. Pre split options in AMZN are currently pricing in about a 10% move for the June 10th expiry. That aligns with a post-split levels of about $103 on the downside and about $126 on the upside. Here’s how that expected move looks pre-split:

Earlier this week, the House of Mouse launched Disney Home, a new design brand that will offer Disney themed furniture and home decor in collaboration with artists and celebrities. 

Think Ruggable rugs featuring subtle Mickey motifs, vintage Star Wars and Marvel posters, dinnerware with hidden Mickeys! $DIS also plans to offer ""aspirational furniture"" and ""bespoke pieces"" later on.

**Why it matters**: Home decor has ballooned into a $682 billion industry. As many companies continue to allow hybrid and remote work options, many people are paying to upgrade their home/work environment. 

**My position**: I found a credit spread for Disney partner Wayfair $W which have been recently beaten down but analysts are forecasting 21% upside in the next year. 

This strategy makes up to 39.3% (59.2% annualized) with 34% cushion ($44.87 breakeven).

Sell 2 $45 puts

Might look complicated to the uninitiated, but spreads have much higher chance of winning than single leg options.

Some thoughts are despite the attractively low stock price there is still room to fall. [P/E ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/pe-ratio) is still high vs what it was for many years. Streaming is expensive to produce for as evident by Netflix plunge and competition is fierce. Operating costs are high for parks and the renewed pro labor movement may result in demands for higher pay, more benefits, etc - $$$$ out of Disney corporate pockets. Management has attracted the unwanted attention of the go woke go broke moment, and Disney sentiments online seem to be shifting to badly managed and too high prices.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a hedgie, and this post does not include 30 pages of science or massive linkedin pictures of Nintendo's executives....okay, I'll include one:

# TL;DR - $NTDOY PT of $93 for 46% 1-Yr Gain (jk, I'm holding forever)

* Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Nintendo Switch Sports and several other popular titles expected this year are actual money printers
* Super Nintendo World theme parks + Cinema add substantial revenue growth opportunities
* Nintendo has paid variable semi-annual dividends since 1985--hold in taxable account if you want to reclaim a portion of the foreign dividend tax as a tax credit
* Melvin Capital took advantage of low trading volume back in 2018 in a short position on the stock contributing to a 27% decrease in the stock price from its May 2018 peak...Figure this is worth mentioning.

# **Note that NTDOY is an ADR that represents 1/8 of 1 ordinary share of Nintendo. There is an ADR with a 1:1 ratio but NTDOY has much more daily trading volume. Relating to stock price, I will only refer to NTDOY for the entirety of this analysis.

# BUSINESS OVERVIEW

**What does NTDOY do?** \- Nintendo develops, manufactures, and sells video game software and hardware globally. The Company owns some of the world's most successful video game franchises including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Fire Emblem (also Metroid can we get an actual MP4 update ffs) and has substantial ownership of and rights to other intellectual property including Pokemon and Sega.

**How Does NTDOY make money?** \- Nintendo generates revenue from the sale of physical and digital video games (incl. mobile) and consoles as well as from minority ownership of other popular franchises and licensing fees from toy, fashion brands, and other merchandise sales. The Company has begun diversifying its revenue streams with a new focus on theme parks and increased focus on cinema.

***Recent Developments***

***Mar 2021: Super Nintendo World*** *- Nintendo debuts its first ever theme park ""*[*Super Nintendo World*](https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/home)*"" at Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan.* [*The Company plans to expand the park by 2024 and to open additional parks*](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2021/10/07/a-donkey-kong-land-is-likely-coming-to-universal-orlando-but-first-it-will-open-in-japan) *at the Universal Studios locations in* *Los Angeles, California* *(2022, possibly 2023) and Orlando, Florida (2025).*

# The Ongoing Console War

While Nintendo is criticized for frequently contradicting industry trends as well as inferior system performance compared to its peers, the Company has a long proven track record of creating industry-changing video game experiences with innovative consoles including the Game Boy series, the Nintendo DS, the Wii, and the Nintendo Switch. In fact, [data for the highest selling consoles ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles) suggests that Nintendo is to date, the most successful video game console maker in the world:

# 2022 Major Video Game Line-Up

**Biggest VG Releases for 2022 based on historical series unit sales:**

* ***Pokemon: Legends Arceus*** \- [already the fastest selling series title for the Switch](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-topped-us-game-sales-in-january-but-ps5-and-xbox-outsold-switch/)
* ***Nintendo Switch Sports*** \- even when discounting the copies bundled with the Nintendo Wii, [the Wii series sold over 85mln units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Wii_video_games)
* **Sequel to** ***The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*** \- Fully expected to outsell [the first installment released in 2017 which has since sold 25.8mln units](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)

* If historical sales are any indicator, Pokemon and Nintendo Switch Sports should sell quite well.

# FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

**Historical & Projected Financials**

https://preview.redd.it/18ul0zv5eej81.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f25bf2ac18670c7cbfb796abb63270b4cb4144d

**Assumptions**

* Estimates for Revenue, EBITDA, and Net Income from CFRA Equity Research are referenced
* Expectation of a 8% decrease in sales for FY 2022 (ending March 31st) compared to FY 2021 which was driven by strong console unit sales and *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* during the global economic shut down.
* Forecasting a 10% increase for FY 2023 sales given strong expected sales of popular games including successors to a few of the best selling video game titles of all time such as *Pokemon: Legends Arceus*, *Nintendo Switch Sports,* and *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2*, as well as increased Super Nintendo World ticket sales.
* Given a potential delay relating to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, **this forecast does not include estimated sales of the Nintendo Switch 2**. In an upside case where the Switch 2 is released by March 31, 2023, **it is reasonable to expect 15% sales growth for FY 2023.**
* Slightly lower operating and net profit margins resulting from increased advertisement spend and R&D, offset by cost efficiency of higher software vs hardware sales mix.
* Dividend Payout of 40% of Net Income at low end of payout ratio for the past five years.

# MULTIPLES ANALYSIS

|METRIC|FY 2021|Est. FY 2022|Est. FY 2023|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EV/Revenue|2.7|2.9|2.6|
|EV/EBITDA|7.2|8.2|7.6|
|Debt/EBITDA|No Debt|No Debt|No Debt|
|P/E|13.3|15.7|14.3|
|EV/FCF|8.2|10.9|9.9|

**Assumptions**

* Estimates for Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, and FCF are shown in the above Financial Analysis
* No debt issuance (no need when 61% of balance sheet is cash)
* Enterprise Value assumes no change in stock price

# Comparables

***NOTE:*** *Nintendo's comps in actuality are PlayStation, Xbox, PC, mobile, and VR. However, for purposes of this stock analysis, it is not possible to conduct a comparable analysis specific to console, PC, or mobile, as well as video game unit sales (okay maybe it's possible but fuck that, I'm not doing all that work for you degens). That stated, I instead compare NTDOY to a select few companies that savvy, totally not retarded investors such as yourselves would be likely to compare NTDOY to including ATVI, EA, SONY, RBLX, and given certain parallels relating to its incredible brand loyalty and IP expansion strategy....DIS.*

*Furthermore, I am leaving out certain video game stocks including TTWO, ZNGA, and several Korean video game centered stocks based on their significantly smaller size in terms of market cap and market share as well as relevant Chinese companies because apparently nobody wants anything to do with Chinese stocks (I don't blame you).* ***This makes the following analysis wide open to counterpoints so if you have wildly differing opinions, feel free to*** ***~~shove them up your ass, find the nearest cliff, and fuck yourself~~*** ***comment below.***

https://preview.redd.it/9bj0o24o3ej81.jpg?width=1004&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344e4419dcaff7bed15ce2edd896e2cf5f7d0aab

Note the substantial discount that NTDOY trades at related to all multiples aside from P/B (which is quite close). RBLX's multiples are excluded from the means shown above because they're ridiculous and would result in excessive skew for the means. We'll now apply a blended multiples valuation to calculate a PT.

# VALUATION

Let's use EV/Rev, EV/EBITDA, P/B, and P/E as the key metrics for our multiples valuation. We'll average the comps based multiples (excluding RBLX) and 5-year historical averages for NTDOY for a blended approach. This actually results in a lower PT compared to the PT resulting from relying solely on NTDOY's historical averages.

&#x200B;

|VALUATION METHOD|Blended Price Target|Applied Weighting|
|:-|:-|:-|
|EV/Rev (3.8x avg)|$86|*25%*|
|EV/EBITDA (13.7x avg)|$103|*25%*|
|P/B (3.5x avg)|$87|*25%*|
|P/E (21.6x avg)|$96|*25%*|
|**FINAL PRICE TARGET**|**$93**|*100%*|

# Multiples based Price Target: $93

This PT provides a potential 48% upside when accounting for the expected 2.3% forward dividend yield. Note that this is strictly a 1-year PT since the valuation will surely change substantially over time as Nintendo opens new theme parks and continues to capitalize on its IP expansion strategy. **That said, this is a very long-term hold for me as I firmly believe that Nintendo has yet to tap into its full potential which will likely take many years.**

^(Whereas the development of Metroid Prime 4 will apparently take decades...)

# RISKS

* **Continued Semiconductor Chip Shortage (Moderate)** \- Could result in lower than expected production of existing Nintendo Switch consoles or *temporary* delay (*note:* ***not*** *cancellations*) of major VG releases, Super Nintendo World openings, or the Nintendo Switch 2.
* **Execution Risk on IP Expansion Strategy (Low)** \- Poor sales from the upcoming Super Mario Bros movie could discourage the Company from furthering its push into cinema, resulting in limited lost opportunity relating to Nintendo's long term growth.
* **Low Trading Volume / Short Selling Risk (Moderately High)** \- Average daily trading volume is relatively low, ranging from 300k to 400k shares. Stock price performance may be hindered by rebalancing of sizable funds (wtf Cathie Wood) or heavy short selling volume (fkn Melvin). Note that this risk does not preclude the opposite from occurring where low volume or short covering pushes the stock price upward.

# 

# TL;DR - $93 PT for 48% 1-Yr Gain (jk, I'm holding forever)

* Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Nintendo Switch Sports and several other popular titles expected this year are actual money printers
* Super Nintendo World theme parks + Cinema add substantial long-term growth opportunities
* In recent years, annualized dividend yields have been around 2%. Nintendo has paid variable semi-annual dividends since 1985--hold in taxable account if you want to reclaim a portion of the foreign dividend tax as a tax credit

The theme parks and resort revenue definitely took a hit due to COVID, but was slowly climbing back.

January 24th marked the lows of the recent selloff. SPY is higher by about 7% since then, with the VIX down more than 40%.

### In the News

Macro news is still front and center, with inflation, Fed moves, and Russia/Ukraine headlines causing day to day sentiment shifts. Amidst that backdrop have been some fairly eye-popping moves following earnings. Meta/Facebook and Amazon were two of the largest mega-cap earnings moves in recent memory. As stated a few weeks ago, earnings during a high implied vol environment can have unique characteristics. From Jan 23rd:

*Options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day’s potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30. There’s also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the “shoot first, ask questions later” phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example. Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves.*

Meta’s move was an example like Netflix, with a massive move lower following disappointing news. But on the flipside, Amazon blew out its results and saw a massive move higher. The options market wasn’t even close to correctly pricing either possibility, and there was a lot of short gamma in the options market to help supercharge those moves. SNAP also saw a massive move higher, albeit in a much smaller market cap situation than AMZN.

sbs69l_DIS,DIS,Picking between DIS and MO,"Disclaimer upfront: I'm a novice at best, but I'm always trying to learn.  I've been slowly adding to small positions in each of these companies over the past 2 years and currently own \~5k in each.  I just finished a decent-sized side job and have 5k more that I'll be putting into one or both of them.   I intend both of these to be long-term holds for me (barring anything crazy happening of course).  I've been adding to each position equally $ wise each month.  I believe in both businesses, they both have a great track record, and on a long-term horizon, I believe them to both be a good value.  That all said - DIS dividend is still on hold while MO hasn't missed a div increase in 50+ years and has been a very strong performer for me.  I'm starting to think I should be doubling down on MO compared with DIS.  Then again - when DIS finally does announce they're starting dividend payments back up my guess is there will probably be a decent bump in stock price to go along with it.  I guess I'm just looking for the advice of people who think about these things a lot more than I do - What % of this 5k would you recommend going towards each company?",2022-01-24,2,17

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **There aren’t many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isn’t any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, you’ll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. I’ll likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since it’s the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season, generating [back to back 30 baggers](https://imgur.com/a/v5NLArJ) just last week.

&nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since it’s inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesn’t indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning we’ve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so you’ve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they’re buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn’t go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

Although I’m sitting this one out, I hope you all end up having an awesome week of earnings! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **There aren’t many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isn’t any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, you’ll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. I’ll likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since it’s the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season, generating [back to back 30 baggers](https://imgur.com/a/v5NLArJ) just last week.

&nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since it’s inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesn’t indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning we’ve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so you’ve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they’re buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn’t go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 0.7% vs the 1.0% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing less than a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$446** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was lower on the week from around 18 to close Friday near 16. That is below its historical average and index/etf expected moves for the next week are tight as a result.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.1%**
* IWM **1.9%**
* DIA **1%**

### In the News

Robinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we’ve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.

Skew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:

Be careful for the IV Crush, please trade with caution! Anyway the two big names I’m looking out for is $PLTR and $COIN. 


Palantir has seen its stock fall from $45 to $19 this year, after a disappointing Q4 Results. Although Palantir’s quarterly revenues came in stronger than expected, it posted a quarterly loss. Palantir’s revenue guidance for the full year 2021 was also lower than expected. Do you expect $PLTR to beat Wall Street estimates and surge after their Q1 earnings reports? The safest strategy for me, might be to play Iron Condor. 


Coinbase, the disruptive tech company. $COIN has trended lower since it went public on April 14, falling from levels of about $328 per share on listing day to about $281 per share. Some analyst  believe $COIN is very reliant on Bitcoin, 
which has also declined by almost 15% since Coinbase went public. I believe $COIN will have a very good Q1 Report, but I also do believe the cryptocurrency trading platform competition is building up. Coinbase are known for their expensive fees which account for over 80% of its revenues, with many other crypto competitors are offering lower fees. I wonder if we will see a uptrend from $COIN this week. 

This Week's Earnings Includes :

-Walt Disney
-Alibaba
-Palantir
-Coinbase
-Airbnb
-DoorDash
-Virgin Galactic
-Roblox
-Unity Software
-Lemonade
-EA
-Wendy’s
-Wynn Resorts

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$418** as a *bearish consensus* and **$427** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Luminar** LAZR / [Expected Move: **10%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LAZR) / Recent moves: none

**Aurora Cannabis** ACB / [Expected Move: **10%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ACB) / Recent moves: -13%, +15%, -29%

These expected moves can help with strike selection, as well as a gut check on any positions going into the event (for instance if you have an OTM call way beyond the expected move). Stocks tend to stay within their expected moves around 65-70% of the time, but often those surprise moves beyond expected can be big ones, obviously. But when long options, and not getting a move beyond the expected move you are faced with an overnight vol collapse. Conversely, when short options via credit spreads, you're essentially rooting for the stock to no move beyond the expected move.

n3g966_GM,GM,"HOFV - NFTs, Sports Betting and the Disneyland of American Football","Hello r/pennystocks, last time I did a DD post on HOFV I got called a bag holder.  A month later, this stock has hit its $3 bottom and its uptrend is just getting started

https://imgur.com/a/qqRN0WL

If you’re not familiar with HOFV here is quick overview:

* The “Disney” of the NFL Hall of Fame

* The CEO of HOFV, Michael Crawford, worked at Disney for 13 years

* They’ve completed Phase I of their resort at the official Pro Football Hall of Fame location, which includes a stadium and 5 additional fields for youth sports (https://www.hofvillage.com/p/getinvolved/phase-1)

* Phase 2 underway to include a waterpark, a hotel, retail promenade and several more facilities (https://www.hofvillage.com/p/getinvolved/phase-2)

The beauty of HOFV is that there are multiple plays going on here.  For the short term, the most attractive of these is the NFTs they are developing with their partner Dolphin Entertainment, which lead to their initial pump from $2 to $8 a few months ago.

https://imgur.com/a/oBQJeTs

Now that the NFTs are getting closer to release, we have been seeing a steady rise towards that price target again.  NFTs are still an unfamiliar space for many, but we have seen multiple examples, TKAT being one of them, that took it from being a penny stock to a $50+ stock in a matter of days that is now settled at around $30

https://imgur.com/a/GHoxMdK

There is an obvious demand for NFTs as people still want their collectibles, but in digital format.  HOFV with their partner Dolphin Entertainment are working, and will be releasing soon, NFTs focused on Hall of Fame football players, including new inductees such as Peyton Manning.  Will NFTs do to HOFV what they did for TKAT?  Who knows, but I’m glad I’m on this rocket for the potential of liftoff.  If you want to learn more, here’s the CEO of HOFV discussing the potential of NFTs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDe0QrHT5DQ

---

HOFV is much more than NFTs though.  The next play which I’d categorize as short to mid-term is sports betting.  HOFV is located in Ohio where sports betting is currently illegal, but may be made legal as soon as this week

https://www.gamingtoday.com/news/ohio-sports-betting-bill-expected-next-week/

The CEO has talked multiple times about sports betting and potential partnerships for both physical and online sports betting.  DraftKings partnership?  Penn National Gaming?  Who knows?  There’s a lot of potential for them in this space, as the CEO has talked about here on Benzinga:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvvYr4TZZzQ&t=3962s

HOFV has also launched their fantasy league, called [Hall of Fantasy League](https://thehofl.com/) where you can bet a stake in a team and be part of a community drive fantasy team.  This is a unique approach to fantasy sports and diverges from the traditional, 1 person has 1 team way of fantasy sports.  Instead here, you stake a team and a GM controls the roster based on feedback from the community.  This year will be their first season and it’s just another reason for HOFV’s latest growth.

---

Finally there is the long term play.  The Hall of Fame Resort itself.  Michael Crawford, a former Disney executive, continues to strive to turn this into “Disney” of American Football.  Phase 2 is well underway as mentioned earlier in this post.  If you’re looking for a company to compare the physical location to as far as a business strategy, look at Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (MSGS).  For the long term, HOFV has the potential to reach MSGS levels in a few years.

No matter the type of investor you are, HOFV has a little bit of everything for everyone.  Please do your own DD.  I am not a financial advisor, I just really like the HOFV stock.

TLDR - **NFTs, Sports Betting and American Football Resort, on the uptrend for a few weeks now, so much potential.  May not be a penny stock after this week**",2021-05-02,18,23

“Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations,” Chapek said in a [conference call with analysts](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/snvice4i) later, noting it stood at 26.5 million subscribers in the same-quarter a year ago. He also noted spikes in usage for ESPN+ (up 83% to 12.1 million) and Hulu (up 30% to 35.4 million).

Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.

lhhsnt_DIS,DIS,Please help me understand Dis 26th Feb-200$ call options,"Hi everyone,

Newbie here who has never traded a stock option before (just stocks). I was looking at Disney call options since I have a good feeling about their earnings report. The current price is at 189.30 and I realized that the 26th Feb call option with a strike price of 200$ has a very high volume and open interest. 

Can someone help me understand why this call option is traded so much. If disney moves in the right direction, it needs to gain ~5% in two weeks for this call to have any implicit value. And post earnings, the volatility will go down. So what are the chances anyone can make money out of this? Why are people buying this then?

ler2k3_GM,GM,Walt Disney Company (DIS) Valuation," **Walt Disney Company (DIS):**

**History:** The history of the Walt Disney Company is rich in tradition and wonder. Founded by Walt Disney in 1923, the Disney brand was able to create the most beloved cartoon characters of its time. And as the characters came to life on black and white screens, the company grew bigger and bigger. Walt Disney became the source of entertainment for children in the 20th century and even made an entry into the amusement park industry with great success. The Walt Disney Company also made several strategic acquisitions before the 21st century, giving them even more room to grow their entertainment products and design higher-quality projects. **The Walt Disney Company has conquered the hearts of many families for several decades with, again, a great success.** 

 **Recent Story:** Today, the Walt Disney Company faces some financial difficulties. The company still has overwhelming success in the entertainment industry, but due to COVID and the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, a global entertainment company, the Walt Disney Company has taken on an overwhelming amount of debt ($ 62 billion). Although this debt persists, the Walt Disney Company has proven to be quite versatile in increasing its presence in the online streaming business. They have made it imperative to focus on Consumer Direct products and expand their portfolio of services, all while the COVID continues to rage. In the short term, it has proven to be quite effective for their earnings, but will this sort of growth persist?

&#x200B;

First, this is my first post in this sub, but not my first prediction post on DIS. I have been predicting DIS rise since 4 months ago, including various posts in various subs before ER, and another one yesterday right before investor event --- which are all right on spot (see my post history). My last post was removed by WSB for no obvious reason, so I decide to give it a try here. Feel free to reverse me if you wish though.

Second, the investor day yesterday is an excellent one:  much more contents to DIS +; >10M subscriber increase in just 2 months; targets >200M for DIS + subscriber & >300M total by 2024; and subscription price increase. As DIS hits its own target, its streaming business will be far larger than NFLX now. So the market cap should be NFLX + Park + unique DIS brand, I would say 400-500B at least, or 250-300.

But stock price won't get there over a week (unless WSB meme it up). I first posted my DIS prediction during the summer, yet stock price action has been very uninteresting despite the imminent growth picture. This reminds me of AMZN cloud that pushes it from 500-1500 in two years, and TSLA during 2019. So long DIS+ keeps on its growth trajectory by adding >10M subsciber per quarter, then they are on course to their 2024 target --> stock price will easily rise to >200 during early 2021.

Finally, park pent-off demand will appear during 2021, as Covid curve being controlled by vaccine and better treatment. If this demand does not conflict with DIS + growth, then DIS has a good chance to trade above 250 or even 300.

&#x200B;

My core position in DIS: holding 2022 leaps since summer. Will hold til 2022 or if DIS breaks 420 next year.

My suggested position: 2022 or 2023 leaps (I have been constantly suggesting this during my previous DIS predictions, which tripled since summer). Say 2023 Jan 200 call, I think they have a good chance to triple next year. And don't bet on weeklies.

Potential risk: Macro uncertainty is always there for options. Also, if DIS+ subscriber increase is slower than 10M per quarter, stock may take a hit for that particular quarter (but vice versa if they can add 20M per quarter stock will moon even harder).",2020-12-11,26,21

Disney pumped big Monday  $124 into Tuesday $130 this week.  Overall I think Disney still likely has some upside in its future. We can see that today Disney came all the way back down to 124 and filled the gap from earlier this week. It also touched the 21 and 55 EMA (yellow and green) lines which acted as support.  I am buying 1 call at the moment just to get a position started.  Depending on how things go I may add to this. 1D momentum oscillator's also in a bullish posture https://www.tradingview.com/x/jaSRyHg0/

I opened this disney play about 4 weeks ago at the 100 and 200 1D EMA's.  today Disney hit a hiigh of 147, but is selling down with the rest of the market.  I am going to hold as long as Disney stays over 136.  If that breaks I will look to sell",2020-11-09,1,0

""We lower our FY4Q20 revenue estimate by 26% to $14.6B, and we double our projected EPS loss to $0.69 based on the continuing negative COVID-19 impacts on DIS's revenue, profitability and asset mix, including: 1) a shift of sports rights costs from 3Q to 4Q, when more games were played and aired by ESPN; (2) higher costs at Broadcasting: (3) no (or low) attendance at DIS Theme Parks; (4) continued box office closures; and (5) higher DTC losses. As a result, we also lower our FY20 DIS revenue estimate to $65.285B (down 7% y/y and 1% below our previous estimate), and Adjusted EPS estimate to $1.52 (down 74% y/y and 13% below our prior estimate). We maintain our HOLD rating.""

""We now estimate FY4Q20 revenue of $14.64B (down 26% y/y and 4% below our previous estimate), and an Adj EPS Loss of $0.69 (down from positive $1.07 in FY4Q19 , and double our prior EPS loss estimate of $0.34).""

**""1. Media Networks.** We make no changes to our revenue estimate for this segment of $6.53B (approximately flat y/y). However, we raise costs and lower our EBITA estimate to $1.29B (down 28% y/y and 21% below our previous estimate) to reflect much higher sports rights expenses in the quarter as the NBA, MLB, NFL and MLS all returned to play in the quarter. Despite this, there was ratings weakness in the quarter. For the Broadcasting segment, we estimate revenue of $2.2B (down 3% y/y), and EBITA of $176mm (down 53% y/y and 24% below our previous estimate). For the Cable Networks segment, we estimate revenue of $4.33B (up 2% y/y), and EBITA $930mm (down 26% y/y and 23% below our previous estimate).

**2. Parks, Experiences, Products.** We maintain our revenue estimate of $2.66B (down 60% y/y), but we lower our estimate for EBITA to a loss of $1.225B (below 3Q19 EBITA of $1.4B and 12% below our previous estimate) as we add costs to maintain the parks that are open and cleaned on a continuous basis. We expect this segment's results to be driven by theme park closures globally, as well as lower merchandise licensing revenue.

**3. Studio Entertainment.** We estimate revenue of $2.085B (down 37% y/y and 6% below our previous estimate), and EBITA of $563mm (down 48% y/y and 15% above our previous estimate). Our EBITA estimate is impacted by lower than previously estimated box office results, more than offset by lower marketing costs in the quarter. We expect to see the negative impact of limited box office on the home video segment for at least the next few quarters.

**4. Direct-to-Consumer & International.** We lower our revenue estimate to $4.765B (up 39% y/y and 10% below our previous estimate), and we increase our projected EBITA Loss to $1.1B (down 49% and 72% worse than our prior estimate). Our new EBITA Loss estimate reflects comments made by management on DIS's 3Q20 earnings call.""",2020-09-24,1,1

Kanye has recently signed a clothing deal with Gap which has brought life back to the stock.

ESTC saw an increase in option activity this week after reporting earnings. The stock has had a 20% rise in the last 3 weeks. Looks like some of the flow could be some protection buying, locking in profits, as well as some bullish flow with the $125 strike expecting the stock to continue it’s run. The stock is currently trading at $110. The flow was tough to read, but interesting to take note of with an uptick in volume here.

**AMBA – Ambarella Inc**

Somewhat of a low-key ticker getting some attention recently is AMBA (Ambarella). Pretty one-sided call flow coming through sweeping a range of strikes out the money. Most in a pretty short-term time frame (September 18). Looks like AMBA is set to report earnings this week and these look to be an earnings play.

**IQ – iQIYI Inc.**

I’ve heard IQ is like the Netflix/Youtube combination in China, not exactly sure. Looks like the September expiration had some solid flow roll through skewed to the bullish side. There was also bullish activity happening two weeks ago, the stock consolidated in a tight range for those 2 weeks and just shot up over 10% this week. Looks like most of this recent bullish flow came through AFTER the stock shot up and they are trying to build a momentum position.

**SHAK – Shake Shack Inc.**

Some bearish activity in Shake Shack last week. The stock is close to it’s pre-covid high, but still down about 40% from ATH back in the end of 2019. Some bearish activity rolled through this week, with a heavy put-buying in October 16 PUT contracts. 2,700 contracts were opened for a $1.6m position. I don’t typically like to follow bearish activity because stonks usually go up, but thought this was noteworthy. Earnings aren’t until November, so this could be potentially a second wave/shutdown play as we get into the fall months.

**DIS – Walt Disney Company**

DIS saw some OTM call sweeps being bought up last week. Here’s the intraday sentiment outlook as the daily doesn’t do it justice. Most of these calls were bought OTM with a few being pretty far OTM. In my opinion DIS will struggle with revenues in our post-covid world, but I’ve learned from experience to not FK with the mouse. Most of these plays were 3-9 months out with April 2021 expiration. This is more of a long-term timeframe expecting the stock to break through pre-covid all-time-highs.

I’ve heard IQ is like the Netflix/Youtube combination in China, not exactly sure. Looks like the September expiration had some solid flow roll through skewed to the bullish side. There was also bullish activity happening two weeks ago, the stock consolidated in a tight range for those 2 weeks and just shot up over 10% this week. Looks like most of this recent bullish flow came through AFTER the stock shot up and they are trying to build a momentum position.

**SHAK – Shake Shack Inc.**

Some bearish activity in Shake Shack last week. The stock is close to it’s pre-covid high, but still down about 40% from ATH back in the end of 2019. Some bearish activity rolled through this week, with a heavy put-buying in October 16 PUT contracts. 2,700 contracts were opened for a $1.6m position. I don’t typically like to follow bearish activity because stonks usually go up, but thought this was noteworthy. Earnings aren’t until November, so this could be potentially a second wave/shutdown play as we get into the fall months.

**DIS – Walt Disney Company**

DIS saw some OTM call sweeps being bought up last week. Here’s the intraday sentiment outlook as the daily doesn’t do it justice. Most of these calls were bought OTM with a few being pretty far OTM. In my opinion DIS will struggle with revenues in our post-covid world, but I’ve learned from experience to not FK with the mouse. Most of these plays were 3-9 months out with April 2021 expiration. This is more of a long-term timeframe expecting the stock to break through pre-covid all-time-highs.

DIS +10% on Earnings
 
ADP Number a MAJOR MISS
 
Another New High for NASDAQ
 
 
Today’s market got off to a positive start even though the ADP payroll number, expected to be +1 million jobs came in at a meager +167,000.  This was before the good ISM numbers came in well above both expectations and last months number.  By the end of the day the DJIA was +373.05 (1.39%), NASDAQ +57.24 (.52%), S&P 500 +21.26 (.64%), the Russell the big winner +29.02 (1.91%), and the DJ Transports +128.75 (1.28%).  Market internals were a sold 2:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ and NYSE volume was better at 3:1 up.  Bond markets were slightly lower with the long end actually gaining a bit and steepening the yield curve.  The U.S. Dollar index continues to fall and I will be working on an advisory for the Weekly Insights letter for ways to play the weak dollar using ETFs.

BITCOIN: closed $11,850 +480. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a “running correction” pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $11980 today. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $13.84 + .64 today.

SECTORS: There was plenty of earnings news around with the big name, DIS reporting and after a decline from 117 to 113.50 in last night’s trading it reversed higher and finished higher last night and followed today to hit $130.31, finished the day $127.61 +10.32 (8.8%).  Also reporting, SQ with a beat finished the day $146.20 +9.37 (6.9%).  CTL beat and was $10.29 +.45 (4.57%), ROKU with a beat, but soft guidance $162.10 -3.32, SONO, with a loss but a revenue beat $15.40 -2.10, WDC with a miss on revenues and poor guidance $38.56 -5.89 (13.25$), and FSLY with a beat top and bottom lines but $93.20 -15.80 (14.5%).  Also, in the news, Teladoc (TDOC) and Livongo Health (LVGO) announced a merger that evidently no one likes as both stocks were sharply lower.  TDOC $202.01 -47.41 (19%) and LVGO $128.06 -16.47 (11.4%).
FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -2.20, BGS +.84, FLO -.08, CPB -.71, CAG -.48, MDLZ -.43, KHC -.30, CALM -.90, JJSF +2.02, SAFM -1.66, HRL -.75, SJM -2.00, PPC -.35, KR -.36 and PBJ $33.60 -.17 (.51%).
 
 
BIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB + .09, ABBV -1.03, REGN -23.91, ISRG +9.39, GILD -1.73, MYL +.63, TEVA +.71 (6.02%), VRTX -2.48, BHC +.51, INCY -2.33, ICPT +.46, LABU +1.14, and IBB $137.45 -.23 (.17%).

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.
 
 
FINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.41, JPM +1.60, BAC +.46, MS +.49, C +.87, PNC +1.27, AIG +.40, TRV +1.98, AXP +1.91, V +3.70, and XLF $24.34 +.34 (1.42%).
 
 
OIL, $42.19 + .49. Oil was lower in last night’s trading before we rallied in the morning on a bigger than expected drawdown of supplies. We have tried several times to break to the upside and traded as high as $43.52 today before running into supply and turned it back.  The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $37.43 +.39 (1.05%).
 
 
GOLD $2049.30 +28.30. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,070.30.  I have only the NEM August 65 / 70 spread on in the Gold market. The spread was put on at $1.30 and finished the day @ $3.38.
 
 
BITCOIN: closed $11,850 +480. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a “running correction” pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $11980 today. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $13.84 + .64 today.

DIS +10% on Earnings
 
ADP Number a MAJOR MISS
 
Another New High for NASDAQ
 
 
Today’s market got off to a positive start even though the ADP payroll number, expected to be +1 million jobs came in at a meager +167,000.  This was before the good ISM numbers came in well above both expectations and last months number.  By the end of the day the DJIA was +373.05 (1.39%), NASDAQ +57.24 (.52%), S&P 500 +21.26 (.64%), the Russell the big winner +29.02 (1.91%), and the DJ Transports +128.75 (1.28%).  Market internals were a sold 2:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ and NYSE volume was better at 3:1 up.  Bond markets were slightly lower with the long end actually gaining a bit and steepening the yield curve.  The U.S. Dollar index continues to fall and I will be working on an advisory for the Weekly Insights letter for ways to play the weak dollar using ETFs.

The resumption of studio production and movie release dates remain uncertain, including Mulan (now set to open in theaters on July 24).

Analysts at Needham now expect Disney’s FY20 revenues will be down 3% y/y to $68.1bn and adjusted EPS down 77% y/y to just $1.34.

The upside to the DIS story is its OTT strategy, where the company has executed quite well and will likely be a winner of the “streaming wars”. Its strategic position for this business line is supported by:

1) its ownership of 3 OTT services: ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu, which is unique and gives DIS the ability to target different market segments and cross promote and bundle with discounts;

2) Disney+ has helped DIS's global OTT adoption, and accelerated by COVID; 

3) $7/ month, $70/year and $3/month IF you subscribe to Disney+ for 3 years is well below Netflix",2020-06-26,11,38

gkdadh_WMT,WMT,"$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company","Remark Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARK) is flying in the market today, and it’s nothing new. For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.
The gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), but there’s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)

DD done by “Informed Observer”

MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK’s intrinsic value.

MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK’s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.

The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.

The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company’s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK’s auditor has not resigned and the Company’s past audits have been qualified with “going concern” risk language, so at this point the auditor’s opinion letter can’t get much worse….unless they refuse to provide an opinion…which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.

As we get closer to MARK’s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28….market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company’s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company’s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization’s credibility.

MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company’s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company’s rare and effective official statement of April 30.

It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK’s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK’s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK’s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).

The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG’s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK’s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.",2020-05-15,6,5

As far as the importance of the expected move? Price targets in context and corresponding strike selection. The expected move is a more  practical expression of implied volatility.

For example, selling puts at  or below the expected move means you'll only be at risk of assignment  if the stock drops farther than options have priced. Selling calls  versus stock at or above the expected move means you'll only be taken  out on a big move higher, above expectations. Same with credit and debit spreads, condors etc. Use the expected move to set your target in  context of the market, and therefore your strikes and you'll realize you are making a bet for or against implied vol.

It has fallen 30% from its highs however, with projected earnings per share and with uncertainty about when they will realistically be able to open and what kind of demand will be there for them when they do means this company should probably suffer another 30-50% drop from where it is.

Insider trading activity reveals a lot of selling throughout last year whenever the stock price was above $140. Former CEO Bob Iger went on a spending spree for many years, buying Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Fox, etc. They have 44 billion in debt on their books, and even when revenues were high people were unsure if this was too risky. In fact Bob Iger was forced to step back from the CEO role earlier this year largely due to the concerns that he had overspent and left the company vulnerable. This was all before CV. Now with their theme parks and cruise lines closed, and their movies unable to be played in theaters, their only source of revenue is the fledgling Disney+ service that is not estimated to turn a profit on its initial investment for 4 years. When theaters open back up, a years worth of movies from all studios will be crammed into the back half of the year, causing loss of profits due to competition. There will also be lowered demand for their parks, movies, and cruises due to less discretionary spending, and a public less willing to hang out in large crowds for fear of a second wave of virus outbreaks.

https://preview.redd.it/e1hz0c7w58s41.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=f651a20e9b9ebc43bbb3696af832f3e29fbe4688

Earnings projections keep being revised lower.  Q2 looks bad and when they announce those earnings next month they will also have to face projections for Q3 being the worst quarter in recent history. I don't believe any of these estimates for Q2 and Q3 will be met, because these projections assume Disney parks will reopen June 1st, a prospect that does not seem belieable if many US states are not projected to peak in infections until mid May. Even if they reopen as soon as they'd like, both domestic and international visitors will be historically low because who wants to go stand in lines next to visitors from every corner of the globe at a time like this? If cruise lines have become plague ships, trips to Disney parks have become epidemic excursions.

https://preview.redd.it/nfkcx3yq68s41.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a9274074596459d35421fd787043f3cc994ea94

Looking at options open interest a strange anomaly appears on the June 19 2020 put contracts at a 55 strike price. I understand the people buying these puts are YOLOers, likely from this forum. They are degenerates of the highest order...but let's consider who is selling them. Some group of individuals or institutions have put nearly a quarter billion dollars aside to secure these puts in preparation to buy Disney stock if it drops to 55 dollars a share by mid June.

Disney may well drop to that level if the earnings are as bad as some analysts are speculating. Even the projected earnings listed above would put the company at $75 per share to maintain its current (and already high) P/E ratio.

This means Disney will likely be unable to maintain $105 per share. $75 is more realistic, and even $55 is realistic if it coincides with a larger drop in the overall market. Many of you hold puts on the S&P, but I wonder if that is the best way to play this market. The S&P contains many companies across many sectors, including healthcare and technology that are not being as negatively affected by current market conditions as others. Disney on the other hand, was already under performing the S&P before the crash, is still under performing now during this rally, and is uniquely vulnerable to the virus, to extended lockdowns, and to lowered consumer spending. This is not currently reflected in it's stock price. Since it is a non-essential company in a discretionary industry is also not likely to benefit as much as other companies from JPow's printer going brrrrrr.

Good sirs and sirettes of this fine gambling establishment, I propose to you a trade. June 19, 2020 $100 strike puts. If DIS closes even in the mid 90s on June 19th, you will have lost nothing. If it closes at the likely $75 dollar mark you stand to make a 250% profit, and if it the dream scenario plays out and it drops to $55, a profit of over 500% will be yours. Every 10k you put into this trade could become 30-60 thousand dollars.

Precious tendies.

I hope you can all understand the peculiar situation that we are in. People will talk about this depression for generations. Process that. So when your dumb grandkid asks you what you did during the Covid-19 pandemic, you should not say you were a bull at the start of the bear market or at the start of the pandemic in the USA. 

Having said that, I admit I have not been trading perfectly, but I have done very, very well up until now... I have previous posts that prove that. 

I see huge issues in liquidity, massive amount of bad news (which are not priced in because they are not in the media yet).... The expansion cycle is over, the corporate bond market will bleed, the valuations are still super high. 

DONT BE FOOLED BY THE BULL TRAP, WE WILL BE TRADING WITH WIDE SWINGS, SO PICK THE EASY TRADES.

Also don’t marry your stocks, let that bitch go and join the winning 🌈🐻 gang. The long bull time will come,but not yet, not next week, not next month.

Either for moral reasons of not helping spread the virus, or that everyone cancelled their reservations, so its uneconomical to stay open. maybe both reasons.

in 1963, after the assassination of President John F Kennedy.

in 1994, Disneyland closed due to the Northridge Earthquake. For structural inspections.

in 2001, Disneyland closed on 9/11.. due to possible terrorist attacks.

now..2020, Disneyland closes for 2 WEEKS (march 15 -> march31)...corona virus. 

Universal Themepark in Orlando is also closing during the same period. Universal is owned by Comcast. $CMCSA

fh1wev_BAC,BAC,Unusual Options - T/BAC/DIS/,"Today I included the aggressive orders, T seems really aggressive since the orders have come in the last 2 days heavy on puts.

These options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order to get filled faster.

Here - [https://imgur.com/a/uW2JNFH](https://imgur.com/a/uW2JNFH)

Also all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest in multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the    aggressiveness of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of these may be hedges and some most likely not.

The T orders are very aggressive, normally T does not have so many sweeping orders especially all puts. Unsure if their is a dividend date or any news pending but that should be watched.  The NCLH was aggressive but those orders are already right and it's too late to chase. Ppl believe Bac will keep dropping.

These orders are from morning to now (2:24pm)

Don't just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry.

Also with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow all combined. Someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020

fg0pzb_DIS,DIS,Why thinking $DIS will close their US Parks is BAD DD,"So, after reading constant idiots talking about how Disney will close their parks, I need to tell you all how you are completely wrong and here is why.

&#x200B;

Disney parks that are currently closed:

Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong

Disney parks that are currently open:

Disneyland, WDW, Paris.

&#x200B;

What are the main difference between those parks? Disney ownership. Disney is NOT a majority holder in the asian parks. They recently got 100% ownership of Paris. One major thing that might change Paris is that the government might force them to close. It does not make that much money anyways. The US government will NOT force Disney to close their doors.

So what happens? If a restaurant worker gets the corona, they will close the restaurant for 2 weeks, deep clean, force workers 2 weeks off at worse, then continue. They will NOT close the whole park down. Does anyone remember the measles outbreak at Disneyland? They didnt do shit. Also, the main issue is that Disneyland and WDW has around 10+ unions. Disney workers have to live in cars because they do not make enough money. The union lawsuits with Disney voluntarily closing will be massive.

Does that mean they will not close? It is possible, but not as much as you retards are thinking. **The only way they will close is if California and Florida forces them to close.** With how much power Disney has against them, they will not take any of those actions. Disney owns Anaheim and Orlando. They can do what they want.

What about the crowd levels? I am guessing most of you dont live in California and dont have annual passes. I went yesterday, and that shit is still packed. You know why? Because 60% of attendance in Disneyland is pass holders. And do you know what pass holders love? It is when tourist attendance is down. All of the tourist attendance is being replaced by pass holder attendance. If you are really banking on Disneyland closing, you all should do some research and download the Disneyland app and watch the wait times. Radiator Springs is currently 75 minute wait and Space Mountain is  60. They ran out of Rise of the Resistance boarding passes today at 8:15am today.

Do I think you should stop buying $DIS puts? No. I think they still will go down. But people who are BETTING on Disney closing US parks are the people that should rethink their methods. I have been a cast member for 10 years and attendance is rising every year. They increase their prices to keep people away but people keep coming. Their Hotels though are at an all time low at this point, so tourists are cancelling their vacations. But for Disneyland, they make more money from annual passholders at this point.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ownership breakdown

Hong Kong - 53% HK Gov - 47% Disney

Shanghai - 57% China, 43% Disney

Tokyo - 100% Japan (Disney licensed)

&#x200B;

Edit 2: For you retards that cant read, this isnt a DD about if your calls or puts are going to print. This DD is solely on the fact that people are basing a lot of their $DIS puts on Disneyland and WDW closing. I dont care if you have DIS puts that are printing. I never said they wouldnt. I actually said it will but know you autists cants read more than a paragraph without a strike and exp date anyways.

Edit 3: Looks like a State wide guidance might close Disney! Gov announced guidance for banning gatherings over 250. Like I said in my original post, California banning gatherings was the wild card! https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/11/california-public-health-experts-mass-gatherings-should-be-postponed-or-canceled-statewide-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/

Puts on DIS,"The first two confirmed cases of beer virus are in counties 45 minutes from Disney down the main central FL corridor (I-4). This is a very densely populated and transient area of Florida and Disney World is smack in the middle of it.

This fact that cases have been found this close means that Disney is probably going to seriously consider shutting down the parks in near future. 

The parks are supercenter of international tourists and travelers that’s probably on the short list of places to shut down first.

### Summary

We believe that Disney entering the DTC market was the right move for the following reasons. They have invested huge amounts into the tech platform (BAMTech) to enable this kind of service. They have one of the strongest brand names in media and entertainment as well that they are the leading content provider on the planet. Their studio productions will be able to serve two fold as blockbuster hits and then down the road adding to their streaming service. It only makes sense for them to dominate the growing DTC media/entertainment market.

However, the DTC market is becoming saturated with strong competitors including: Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, and now the entrants of Disney+ and the recently announced AppleTV+. We see this competition as a double-edged sword in the sense that there is the potential to grab revenues and market-share with the willingness of big companies to take some of the pie (powerful companies want to enter this market because it makes sense to), but also that more elite entrants into this already cut-throat industry is no easy task. What will separate one company from the rest will be their ability to provide quality content, which Disney has positioned themselves to do.

We believe that Disney will be sensitive to outside economic pressures that might affect their cash flow. Revenues from the Media Networks segment (and largest portion of revenues) of their business has been on the decline over recent years, but has been off-set by higher revenues from Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment. Should any of their other segments come short of providing support, their cash flow will take a hit.

The introduction of Disney+ will barely make a dent in their net revenues over the next 4-5 years. Potential growth and valuation will be highly dependent on subscriber count, but with Disneys current state of the brand and franchises they have put themselves in a great position to compete with their largest competitor, Netflix. With quality content coming from each of their studios (Marvel, Pixar, StarWars, and National Geographic, to name a few) they will have a strong line-up going into this launch.

### Final Thoughts

Disney is entering a highly competitive market, but we believe they have the right tools to succeed.

**1.** Theyve already successfully tested out the tech to launch DTC services (BAMTech - 4.9B in expenditures by FY 2020).  
**2.** Their already successful content outlets will provide a great value to their service.  
**3.** Competition, such as Netflix and AppleTV+, will be spending billions on content without a proven track-record. This is a risk for them and not so much for Disney since Disney already has a great pipeline of many quality IP.  
**4.** In terms of pricing, we see many similarities between all DTC content providers and the key factor that will separate one company from the other will be in content, which we believe Disney will provide and excel at.  
**5.** Disneys stock price has already jumped over 30% from the initial announcement of Disney+, but we think this new range will serve as a benchmark and good support.  
**6.** Disney isnt expected to report blowout subscriber count on the launch of their service, but we foresee they have the possibility to do so.  


**Positive Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y (quality studio releases, leveraging of brands to park themes, etc).  
\*Disney reports fantastic initial subscriber count for Disney+.  
\*Disney reports ESPN+ growing in-line with expectations.  


**Neutral Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y.  
\*Disney reports mediocre numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+ (as they are expected and will be viewed as a neutral event).  


**Negative Outlook Model:**  
\*Market is affected by recession, Disney sensitivity to economic pressures.  
\*Growth slowing at media networks.  
\*Growth slowing at parks and resorts.  
\*Very low numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+.",2019-11-03,220,106

The deadline for the choice seems to have been delayed again, but from the limited information I got from my broker, it looks like the details of the choice are also changed.  I haven't figured out where the new offer details might be posted online.

There are three options.  I can't tell what the difference is between option 2 (DIS stock) and option 3 (DIS stock).  I also can't tell what you get if you make no selection.

In the original offer, it was clear that making no selection is equivalent to making whichever selection was less popular, meaning that once the mega shareholders (who can decide 2 days later than ordinary shareholders and with better information) have made the better choice, those who made no choice get the worse choice.  (Rather nasty compared to typical merger choice situations).

It looks now like maybe they fixed that, so making no choice is the same as choosing stock, which still might be the inferior choice, but at least making no choice wouldn't be automatically inferior.  But this merger deal is also harder to understand than any other I've been through (which is more than a few).  So I'm from from certain of any of the above.

Can anyone please give a more informed opinion on ""what is the third choice"" and ""what does making no choice do"", especially with some pointers of where to look in online documents for the information supporting such opinions?

9vgoq5_DIS,DIS,Taking a peek at Disney,"Disney evokes quite a bit of reaction from investors. About ten years ago, people were panning it because it appealed to girls and not boys and especially not teens.

Then they bought Pixar, and made Iger the coo. Then things changed especially after they bought Marvel and Lucasfilm.

The stock is somewhat stagnant in the past few years because some see the marvel and Star Wars franchise as stale and formulaic. Most investors also think the new Disney streaming service isn’t going to be a success unlike Netflix which has had a couple of years of head start.

Disney announced a great quarter yesterday. 

Their trailing 12 months of eps is 7.95, and a Wacc of 7.5 ( source: gurufocus) to 8.5 ( source: various). 

Assuming the eps doesn’t grow, a back of envelope calculation puts it at $93-106.  ( eps/wacc)

Considering that their current price is at $116, the market is pricing it as if there is little growth moving forward. I believe this company is undervalued.

Of course, this is just a initial peek at disney, just because a company is undervalued doesn’t mean it is a great buy. But this should warrant a closer look:

Questions to find out:
- what is the company worth
- what is the reasonable price to buy
- what are some of the catalyst that can unlock value

9sfy7k_DIS,DIS,$DIS - immune to market sell-off and a good time to invest,"Hello!

&#x200B;

With all this uncertainty in the market and the wild fluctuations we are seeing - I don't think right now is a bad time to invest in Disney. 

&#x200B;

Why? 

&#x200B;

1.) Check it's 3 month performance - it's been immune to this crazy ride we've seen over the last few months and has endured just fine with October's correction/borderline correction. When the market does well it'll ride to the $116-119 mark and when it all goes south it'll hit the floor of $110 at worst

2.) Not terrible dividend - not much to say on this - it's not great but you can count on them not cutting it

3.) Streaming service - it's going to be a hit and will A) capture an untapped market in streaming for children. Netflix has tried it but too little, too late, most parents with children complain that they simply don't have enough offerings to keep their child entertained exclusively, Disney will be able to do that. B) They will have majority ownership of Hulu and can pump family offerings to their Disney service, Adult offerings to Hulu 

4.) Diversification - they are going to have income streams from many different avenues (ESPN - Streaming - Disney Parks - Box office - Toys - Cruising) 

5.) Last but not least, a mote - No one can become the next Disney. The brand is simply too strong with too many diversified products that cannot be duplicated  - they will be here for the long-term

&#x200B;

I'm biased because I am long on Disney and it's my 2nd largest holding, but I do believe in this turbulent market they are a safe buy and you can use it to hedge your portfolio from the loses we are seeing. The million dollar question is going to be how they do in the next recession (not arguing when it's going to happen, but just that it will happen eventually) Disney didn't do so hot in 08-09 but I hope this time they are diversified enough to protect themselves from slumping consumer optimism. The question will be will consumers continue to pay streaming subscriptions or will they cancel them to shrink the budget.

Basically the deal will enable Disney to provide a direct to consumer service with a disgusting amount of exclusive content that they know how to monetize in ways that only Disney can. They can now offer new blockbuster movies exclusively through their service and I'm wondering if even movie theaters will have to subscribe if they want to put it on their big screens. That means that Disney can now use their best assets(movies that attract audiences of all ages and backgrounds) to increase subscriber growth and it also puts them in complete control of digital advertising(basically FANG's bread and butter) on their platform which i'm sure will be in very high demand from companies with a lot of money to spend. When you add all of that up with an already successful parks and resorts business, I just don't see how they can screw this up. There is nothing really stopping them from carving out a center in the digital space and perhaps joining FANG in those high price valuations. what am i missing here? I know that they are traditionally not a tech stock and that could be a challenge for them as they enter the space, but if they acquire fox, hulu will fall into their lap, and that is not a bad start.

I’ve traded DIS before successfully, but I’ve held for the past 2 years, and I don’t understand why they are still getting beat up by Wall st. (ESPN has obviously been an issue). 

What are your thoughts? The position is small (less than 2k), but if I’m looking to take some profit from this account in 6-12 months, do I sell or hold?",2018-02-28,2,4
80wobf_NFLX,NFLX,$NFLX V. $DIS,"$NFLX V. $DIS is a common comparison. Looking deeper into these companies it’s hard to justify $NFLX valuation of 126B compared to $DIS valuation of 157B. 

I understand $NFLX has growth potential but so does $DIS, along with a greater array of assets. $DIS has better content, a streaming service, the top sports broadcasting network, a news network, a top movie studio and all of the Disney parks. With the high profile fox buy, $DIS acquired a majority holding in Hulu. Netflix has over 3 times more active users compared to Hulu, meaning there is more room for Hulu to grow than Netflix. $DIS now has the ability to optimize Hulu and stream their original content on the streaming platform, which should lead to greater future growth.

With all of this said $DIS stock has remained stagnant or decreased, while $NFLX has increased greatly. 

Can someone explain this to me or justify $NFLX valuation?

> **Starwood** — The hotel chain has signed off on an improved takeover bid from Marriott, worth $13.6 billion in cash and stock. The new deal comes after China's Anbang topped Marriott's original deal with Starwood with its own offer last week. Separately, Starwood signed a deal to operate hotels in Cuba, becoming the first U.S. hotel company to do so since the 1959 revolution.

Separately, IHS reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share for its first quarter, 5 cents above estimates, while revenue also topped forecasts.

3htw7e_GE,GE,I cant choose between GE and DIS,"Hey guys, I am still pretty new to the stock market world. I currently own Netflix, Starbucks, MRGE..

I have about $2,000 to put into a stock and I can't choose between DIS and GE.

DIS is great and everybody raves about it on here. I like the company and believe they will be around for a very long time. I love  what they are doing in the movie world and also now they are expanding their park with 14 acres of land for their Starwars land. The only thing holding me back is all this ESPN talk. If ESPN truly is 50% of Disney's income and if it keeps going down that seems like it would bring DIS down a lot. 

GE has been around since the late 1800's and they have income coming in from a lot of products. GE also has a much higher dividend yield which is a bonus but not that important to me. The problem I have with GE is that from what I can see from looking at their chart in the past year they have dropped in price and in 5 years they have gone up around 11 points. Whereas Disney has gone up around 90 points. If this trend continues then Disney would be a better investment. 

I want to keep long term at least a few years. Dividends are a bonus but not required.

What do you guys think ",2015-08-21,9,31

3hre0h_DIS,DIS,DIS | Brief Analysis on its Future Prospects,"I have seen a troubling thing in r/investing lately where DIS is discussed in a way that leads new investors to believe there is almost no risk with Disney.  Just a few of my opinions on DIS trajectory.  I have no shares in DIS but I think it is an absolutely great company.  With that said,



The major headwind for Disney is of course the risks of significant revenue/profit decrease as its media portion, specifically ABC and ESPN, stand to lose a lot with the shift to streaming platforms rather than cable.



1.  DIS has significant earnings risk with the current transition from bundled cable TV to streaming platforms.  Disney currently makes roughly ~30% of its profits from ESPN/Media business.  This is part of Disney I believe will not be able to keep its current level of profitability.  Disney makes a significant sum from ESPN as it practically has a monopoly on sports broadcasting in the US.   Disney is able to extract a lot of money from cable companies as almost all cable subscribers watch some type of sport, so not paying Disney's fee would make the cable companies lose a lot of subscribers.



2.  Disney should be able to supplement some of this income loss with income from streaming.  I doubt this will be even close to the amount Disney currently commands from cable companies.  Streaming provides a much more fragmented customer base in my opinion, as Disney was able to get paid even for the cable subscribers who didn't watch sports, as it came included.  



Most people invest in Disney because it is a world renown brand, known for it theme parks, films and ecosystem of related content.  While this part of the business is still incredibly important for Disney, most new investors don't realize that Disney has a lot of exposure to the Media industry I mentioned above.  Parks and recreation revenue is growing at a solid pace, but earnings in Disney are in jeopardy as the trend of cable cutters continues.



With that stated, I believe Disney is still a fantastic company.  My personal opinion is that Disney is going to have a rough couple months and years ahead of it.  The signal for me to buy will be when Disney stabilizes it's Media portion of revenue and get a foundation where investors can be comfortable knowing what ESPN streaming revenue will look like.  A major thing I like about Disney is it's management.  Warren Buffet has always had the view of buying undervalued companies, but also companies that have a moat and that have terrific management.  Disney has both of those.  Its management is world class and has been able to consistently grow and turn Disney into a conglomerate.  I have the utmost faith in management to steer Disney through rough patches.  



If you are a long term investor and already bought stock, you should hold, and not worry yourself about this price dip.  If you are like me and do not own stock, I would wait until Media revenue stabilizes.",2015-08-20,44,21

Thinking about taking my gains, selling it, and using the cash to buy Disney (DIS) which is down about 9% today. With my cash from CMG, I could buy 6 shares of Disney at $110 a share, and have some change left over for future buys.
