1kygqpz_DNA,DNA,"Once a $23B Darling, Now a Penny Stock — What’s Next for Ginkgo Bioworks?","Hey everyone, any $DNA investors here? If you’ve been following Ginkgo Bioworks, you probably remember the short-seller report that shook the company back in 2021. If not, here’s a quick recap of what happened and some updates.

In 2021, Ginkgo Bioworks went public via SPAC, raising $1.6B and attracting major institutional investors. 

However, in October 2021, Scorpion Capital released a [report](https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/DNA1.pdf) labeling Ginkgo a ""colossal scam"", alleging that most of its revenue came from related-party transactions and that many of its partnerships were overstated or misleading (they even mentioned some former employees’ testimonies, lol).

https://preview.redd.it/0yvh20z8ar3f1.png?width=2119&format=png&auto=webp&s=17115577c97b1028b981ae9d92be77f2274fcda2

When this news came out, Ginkgo’s stock fell 12%, and the DOJ launched an investigation.

A month later, shareholders filed a lawsuit, accusing Ginkgo of inflating its revenue and hiding key risks. 

As you might know, Ginkgo has already agreed to settle, [paying up to $17.75M to investors](https://11thestate.com/cases/ginkgo-bioworks-investor-settlement). And, the good news is that even though the deadline has passed, they’re accepting late claims.

Despite this settlement, Ginkgo's stock has continued its downward spiral, having lost over 97% of its peak value. Once worth nearly $30B, the company’s market cap has now dropped to around $825M.

Anyways, do you think Ginkgo can turn things around? And for those who held $DNA stock back then, how much did you lose?",2025-05-29,3,2

1i16z88_DNA,DNA,This company is interesting for the DNA based synthetic lethality treatment,"Aprea Therapeutics ($APRE) has taken a new approach to the forefront of cancer research, developing innovative therapies that exploit synthetic lethality to target cancer cells more precisely.

Their lead product candidate, ATRN-119, is a macrocyclic ATR inhibitor currently in clinical trials, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. The company also has multiple other products in their pipeline ready that are on their way to endure the wrath of clinical trials.

Recent Developments:

* Product advancement: Aprea has initiated a **Phase 1 trial** for ATRN-119, focusing on optimizing dosing regimens to improve patient outcomes. The company has adopted a twice-daily dosing schedule in the ABOYA-119 study, a strategic move to maximize therapeutic benefits.
* Financial Performance: In the third quarter of 2024, Aprea reported a net loss of $3.78 million, a slight increase from the previous quarter. Despite this, the company continues to invest in its pipeline, with $26.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, providing a cash runway for at least twelve months.

Latest Stock Performance:

As of premarket today, $APRE is trading at $3.42. The stock has shown volatility all throughout 2024 with a 52-week range between $2.73 and $6.83, indicating potential for growth.

Aprea's commitment to advancing cancer care through synthetic lethality positions it as a promising player in the oncology sector.

**What is Ginkgo Bioworks?**  
Ginkgo Bioworks is a company that aims to bring together the best of traditional plant breeding and modern biotechnology to create new varieties of plants with unique traits. Their most well-known product is ginkgo biloba, which is used as a supplement and a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and medicines. The company also creates other varieties of ginkgo trees and plants, such as ginkgo trees used to extract ginkgo flavonoids for use as supplements and medicines, and ginkgo plants used to create transgenic crops that produce ginkgo flavonoids for use as supplements and medicines. Transgenic crops produce crops that have been altered or modified using biotechnology, such as the use of genetic engineering  


**Why am I bullish?**  
Biotechnology is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Ginkgo Bioworks is a leader in the field and is one of the few companies that can actually manufacture complex biological compounds. This opens up a range of opportunities for the company, including the ability to create better drugs, better vaccines, and better animal feed. This has the potential to change the world for the better, but only if more people invest in the company.  


This company is incredibly forward-thinking & I am bullish on their future!

w1x09g_DNA,DNA,Mars Candy Company sued: Products contain dangerous DNA-altering chemical unsafe for human consumption.,"Mars Inc., the maker of Skittles, is facing a lawsuit in California over its use of titanium dioxide. The ingredient is known to be toxic, and the company promised in 2016 to stop using it but has defied this mandate and continue to contaminate their candies with dangerous chemicals that are unsafe for human consumption.

Titanium dioxide helps give colors a brighter appearance and is commonly used in mineral sunscreen.

Skittles is facing legal action over its use of a toxic chemical found in artificial coloring.

In a lawsuit filed Thursday in the Northern District of California, plaintiff Jenile Thames claims that Skittles-maker Mars Inc. is deceiving customers and putting their health at risk over its continued use of titanium dioxide for its candy's trademark hues.

udtyqm_DNA,DNA,"Why I’m long on long read DNA sequencing ($PACB, LON:$ONT)","I work in the biotech field and want to lay out why the 2022 biotech sell-off has created an unparalleled opportunity to buy cheaply into technology leaders in a growing field. Specifically, I want to talk about two companies involved in DNA sequencing: the US-listed Pacific Biosciences ($PACB) and the UK-listed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (LON:$ONT). These are household names for people working in biotech but not widely known outside of the field. I will refer to them as PacBio and ONT in the main text below.

**TL;DR:** PacBio and ONT are significantly undervalued leaders in long read DNA sequencing. Together they hold a duopoly in the long read sequencing market, with sizable technology-based moats that even the sequencing Goliath Illumina ($ILMN) with 80% market share has never been able to overcome. In the last 6 months, PacBio has lost 80% of its value and ONT has lost 45% of its value, providing excellent entry points. Bucking the stock price decline, in 2021, revenues grew 65% for PacBio and 94% for ONT as these companies scale up. Together PacBio and ONT own less than a 10% share of the DNA sequencing market, which is currently worth $5.8B. But both their market share as well as the total addressable market are likely to grow rapidly over the next ten years. Going long on PacBio and ONT therefore has a high probability of yielding a 10X return on investment.

# What is DNA sequencing?

For those who went to school before the Human Genome Project started in 1990 and those who forgot their high school biology, DNA sequencing is the process of reading out the nucleic acid sequence of a molecule of DNA. You know that stuff inside all of our cells which encodes our genetic blueprint. Importantly, this DNA is rich in valuable information. Some of the most important types of information we can extract from DNA sequence are:

* genetic mutations that contribute to disease like cancer and other traits
* genetic relationships to other sequences (i.e., who’s the father, or which kind of virus is this?)

It’s useful to remember that roughly [half of common diseases](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.1684https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.1684), and [most rare diseases,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6279436/) are heritable. For example, the risk of cystic fibrosis and breast cancer is well understood to be passed down from parents to their children. In cancer patients, different types of tumors also have different types of characteristic DNA mutations that can be [screened and diagnosed with DNA sequencing](https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-019-0220-8). As we've probably all read in the last few years, DNA sequencing has also been crucial for tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV2 and its variants. The bottom line here is that DNA sequencing provides vital information for improving public health. Information that governments, insurance providers and hospitals are willing to pay good money for. For those outside of the world of biology, I cannot understate how fast biotechnology and precision medicine are developing and how fundamental DNA sequencing is for that.

# What is the total addressable DNA sequencing market?

The DNA sequencing market had a size of [$5.8B in 2021](https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/events-and-presentations). Together with the development of precision healthcare and genetic surveillance of pathogens, this market is expected to grow at a fast clip. Though I don’t put much stock into exact predictions, some reports put the DNA sequencing market compound annual growth rate at [\>10% from 2020 to 2027](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dna-sequencing-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DNA%20sequencing%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%2011.21%20billion%20by%202027). The key thesis here is that not too far in the future, it will become routine healthcare policy to sequence and securely store the DNA of most individuals in developed countries. On top of that, I and others expect that sending tumor biopsy samples for sequencing and surveilling wastewater and other environments by sequencing will become routine, greatly expanding the sequencing market. Because DNA sequencing is a fundamental step in lots of modern biotech labs, one way to view DNA sequencing companies is as a pick-and-shovel play on the biotech sector. PacBio estimates a [$40B+ total addressable market for DNA sequencing](https://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/static-files/9ee0d712-6974-4c44-83e9-5af75541add3) and I think that’s realistic considering today’s trends.

# What’s the competitive landscape in DNA sequencing?

DNA sequencing is not a crowded field, with only a handful of companies playing a significant role. One reason for this is that, similarly to the semiconductor industry, the sequencing industry has a high barrier to entry due to technological complexity. Illumina ($ILMN) remains the 600 pound gorilla in the DNA sequencing space with a market cap of 50B and [2021 revenues of $4.5B](https://investor.illumina.com/news/press-release-details/2022/Illumina-Reports-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20consolidated%20results,%243%2C239%20million%20in%20fiscal%202020). This translates roughly to a market share of 80% based on the estimated size of the 2021 market. With revenues of [$130M for PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/) and [$177M for ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0), these companies are the Davids to Illumina’s Goliath. Today, PacBio commands a market cap of only $1.5B and ONT is in a similar but more highly valued ballpark of $3.5B. Despite the fact that PacBio has been around since 2004 and ONT since 2005, they have not yet had a significant impact on Illumina’s dominance.

There are a few other companies worth mentioning to get the full picture, though I consider them less important for this thesis. In China, MGI is a large sequencing provider that reverse engineered Illumina’s technology and remains banned from the US market and has not penetrated the European market. One of the biggest biotech instrument producers Thermofisher ($TMO) makes the IonTorrent DNA sequencer, but it’s not competitive on price or data quality so is rarely used. There are also two new US companies (Singular Genomics $OMIC and the private Elements Biosciences) that will be launching sequencing instruments similar to Illumina’s in the next year or so. For those interested in more details, Keith Robinson is a scientist with a [great blog](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/) on these and other sequencing technologies.

# Why do we need long reads from PACB and ONT?

When comparing sequencing technologies, the three main quality metrics we care about are sequence length (measured in bases), sequence accuracy and the cost per sequenced base. The longer, the more accurate, and the cheaper a sequence is, the better. I should state here that fundamentally, Illumina, PacBio and ONT use completely distinct sequencing technologies, each with some individual advantages. What makes PacBio and ONT unique compared to all the other sequencing companies is their *long reads*. All other technologies are based on *short reads*. As someone who has worked a lot with sequencing data, I can tell you that here size matters. Without getting too technical, DNA sequences from Illumina and the other sequencing companies are usually 50-500 bases in length while PacBio gives lengths around 10,000 bases and ONT comes packing 10,000-30,000 bases (sometimes up to several million bases).

But why do we care about the sequence length, you ask? Well imagine the DNA sequences are pieces of a puzzle. The difference in getting answers from long read sequencing data and short read sequencing data is like the difference between putting together a 10 piece puzzle and a 100 piece puzzle. Not only that, the short read puzzle is usually missing 10% of its pieces. The reasons for this are technical and related to long stretches of repetitive sequence that make it hard to get the whole picture with short reads. There are notable exceptions where long reads are not needed, including liquid biopsy where we are sequencing short fragments of cancer DNA often less than 200 bases in length. But what matters is that for most applications, when using Illumina data, there’s a moderate amount (perhaps [roughly 25%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929722000659)) of genetic variation that remains hidden. Some of this hidden variation can cause disease. For example, Evan Eichler, a well-known scientist at the University of Washington, emphasized in a recent article that 34% of all disease-causing variation is made up of variants that are [larger than a single base change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681822/), which are more difficult to detect with short reads. We can conclude that long reads offer critical advantages over short reads in clinical and other applications.

# How cost-competitive are long reads?

The extra length of ONT and PacBio does come at a cost. The key cost metric is the price of a human genome (typically at 30x coverage, which means you sequence each base 30 times on average to make sure you don’t miss anything). Cost estimates can vary widely but sequencing expert [Albert Villela](https://twitter.com/AlbertVilella) has put together [a public tabular comparison of different providers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMMfhyLK0-q8XkIo3YxlWaZA5vVMuhU1kg41g4xLkXc/edit?hl=en_GB&hl=en_GB#gid=1569422585), from which I extracted some ballpark ranges.

|*Sequencing provider*|*Cost per human genome*|
|:-|:-|
|Illumina/MGI|$1,000-$6,000|
|ONT|$2,000-$6,000|
|PacBio|$5,000-$40,000|

Although I have to stress that cost estimates vary a lot, clearly Illumina has a lead on cost. However, if we are making clinical decisions affecting people’s health, arguably we healthcare providers may pay a premium to make sure they get the most complete possible information. On top of this, the cost of ONT and PacBio have come down considerably in the last few years and their pace of innovation here has outstripped Illumina. ONT actually reported in their 2021 annual results that they can already generate [a $345 human genome](https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf) and are developing a system to go as low as $235, which would be groundbreaking if this translates to prices for users on the ground.

I like to think of Illumina as similar to Intel: a long time market monopolist with juicy margins ([Illumina gross margin 69% for the last four years](https://ycharts.com/companies/ILMN/gross_profit_margin), nice) that has lost its innovative edge and kept iterating on the same short read sequencing technology. ONT has already come dangerously close in cost to Illumina, and has a real chance of becoming cheaper than Illumina in future.

# Long read accuracy - still the Achilles heel?

We need to now talk about sequence accuracy. What is this? Just like us humans, all sequencing methods make mistakes. These take the form of incorrect bases in the DNA sequence, like typos in a text. For many applications a few errors don’t matter, but when we care about detecting very specific genetic mutations related to disease, we want to avoid even a small number of errors. In the past, Illumina and others have downplayed the threat from long read sequencing by citing its lower sequence accuracy. And until recently it was uncommon to use PacBio or ONT data alone because you needed additional Illumina data to correct the mistakes in the long reads. In the last few years, this has changed as PacBio introduced high-fidelity HiFi reads and [ONT introduced its latest Kit 14 chemistry and duplex sequencing](https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/investors/reports/ONT%20FY21%20Results%20Presentation%20FINAL%2022.3.22.pdf). Illumina no longer has a monopoly on accurate high-throughput reads as the table below shows and [a recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full) nicely lays out.

&#x200B;

|*Sequencing provider*|*Sequencing accuracy*|
|:-|:-|
|Illumina/MGI|99.9%|
|ONT|95%-99.9%|
|PacBio|98%-99.9%|

All these error rates seem low, but remember when you sequence a human genome with 6.4 billion bases, a 99.9% error rate means 6.4 million errors. Even a 0.01% improvement is therefore a big deal. There is some fineprint to the table above and its based on manufacturer numbers and my own experience with the data and reading of the literature, but overall the three platforms are converging on [relatively similar error rates](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466057v2.full]), undermining Illumina’s previous advantage. As a testament to this, short reads are no longer routinely used to supplement long reads in many published scientific studies. Interestingly, there is also a lot of interest from companies like Google to apply machine learning for improving sequencing accuracy. One study by Google and PacBio was able to [reduce errors by 42%](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.31.458403v1.full). These advances suggest to me that long reads can continue to make gains in accuracy and become the gold standard.

# Beyond DNA sequence - detecting epigenetic modifiers

Talking of machine learning, there is another neat feature of PacBio and ONT that I haven’t touched on: machine learning based epigenetic analysis. Bear with me. You may be aware that there is another layer on top of DNA sequence that can affect our genes, this is epigenetics. In practice it means there the DNA molecules get chemically modified, for example through the addition of a methyl group. When you slap a methyl group or some other modification on the DNA it can help turn genes on or off, making it important for some diseases and traits. Ok, biology lesson is over and I can get to the point. The data generated by PacBio and ONT actually allows [detection of DNA modifications like methylation](https://twitter.com/DRBFX/status/1517189018768883713). You get this information for free, together with the DNA sequence. All you need is the right machine learning algorithm and you can read off the epigenetics together with the genetics. Previously, the main way to study methylation was with a method called bisulfite sequencing that uses Illumina short reads and requires special sample preparation. It’s easier and just as, or more, accurate to do it with just PacBio or ONT.

As an investor, epigenetics is particularly exciting because unlike genetics it changes for each person over time. A person‘s DNA only needs to be sequenced once, but we may want to track changes in methylation in different parts of the body over time once we understand the implications for health and aging. I hope that ka-ching sound is ringing for you too. Epigentics, like liquid biopsy for cancer and pathogen surveillance, means repeated revenue over time. Right now, there isn’t a huge market for epigenetic analysis and compared to the DNA sequence this is mostly a ‘nice to have’ but not key feature. But as we understand epigenetics better and demand picks up, this feature could fuel further growth for PacBio and ONT.

# How ONT stands out

One final advantage specific to ONT is its speed (measured as bases sequenced per hour) and the portability and flexibility of its instruments. ONT sequencing gives results in real-time and is generally faster than all the other technologies. A [recent study by Stanford scientists and Google](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112090) showed that ONT can diagnose a patient by sequencing their genome in less than 8 hours. All other methods would take over a day to get the same results. Not all sequencing is time-critical, but in a clinical setting the speed of ONT gives it an edge. Incredibly, the ONT sequencing machines range in size from the dimension of a smartphone (MinIon) to a mini fridge (PromethION), while PacBio machines are fridge-sized and Illumina instrument sizes range from mini fridge to fridge. Finally, one recent ONT development that really blows my mind is their MinION Mk1D​, which combines [a MinION sequencer with an Apple iPad Pro](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion-mk1d) so you can sequence on the go! This isn’t out yet and may never be a big seller, but I think it underlines how portable and exciting the ONT technology is.

Although this point is more subtle, I also want to mention the extraordinary Read Until capability of ONT. This allows sequencing to stop when a target sequence (e.g. a specific disease-related mutation) is found and to reject non-target sequences before they get fully sequenced. If we consider the problem of finding a needle in a haystack, with PacBio and Illumina, you sequence every straw of hay and then look for the needle, whereas ONT can immediately discard straws until it finds the needle in real time, saving time and money.

These unique advantages of ONT are the reason that I,  [together with other scientists in a twitter poll](https://twitter.com/TJesse62/status/1509927475077394438), think that ONT sequencing will ultimately prevail over PacBio thanks to its longer reads, greater portability and lower cost.

# Financial fundamentals and valuation

Despite impressive 2021 yearly revenue growth of [65% for PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results-3/#:~:text=Fiscal%20year%202021%20results,with%20%2434.3%20million%20in%202020) and [94% for ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/preliminary-results-year-ended-31-december-2021-guidance-update-0), both companies still have negative earnings per share, losing $181M and $213M in 2021 respectively. Profitability may still be years away, as the leadership of both companies advises. Still, as shown below these are high margin businesses and can become profitable with scale.

|*Sequencing provider*|*Gross profit margins (2021)*|
|:-|:-|
|Illumina|69%|
|ONT|55%|
|PacBio|45%|

Some good news is that in 2021 both companies secured additional cash to fuel their growth. PacBio raised money (via convertible senior notes) from Softbank and reported cash and equivalents of $1B in the last quarter and ONT raised money through an IPO and reported $0.8B.

Now a word on valuation. Valuing unprofitable biotech companies based on financials is tough. With a price-to-sales ratio (2021 revenues divided by today’s market cap) of 12 for PacBio and 20 for ONT, the long read companies are comparable to Illumina that comes in at 12 but more expensive than a mature biotech company like Thermofisher at 5. Importantly though, these multiples are nothing crazy like the >50 price-to-sales ratios of biotech companies like Twist Biosciences ($TWST), BioNano ($BNGO) and even PacBio that we saw last year.  Today PacBio is worth less than the $8/share that Illumina offered in its foiled [acquisition attempt in 2018](https://www.pacb.com/press_releases/illumina-to-acquire-pacific-biosciences-for-approximately-1-2-billion-broadening-access-to-long-read-sequencing-and-accelerating-scientific-discovery/) and ONT is worth much less than the [$5.4/share IPO price](https://www.reuters.com/business/oxford-nanopore-eyes-47-billion-market-value-london-debut-2021-09-30/).

These are unprofitable biotech companies in the early stages of growth. It’s likely that this factor alone is the main reason these companies have been sold off (or sold short) as fears of inflation and recession swirl. For long-term investors, this presents a considerable opportunity.

# Company leadership

I don’t have many particular thoughts on the ONT and PacBio leadership, but my overall impression based on company performance, interviews and Glassdoor reports is relatively positive.

ONT has been led by its co-founder Gordon Sanghera, Ph.D. since 2005. The consistency and the scientific experience of the leadership here is a benefit for me. I think Dr Sanghera has substantial skin in the game and will execute on the long term vision for the company. He also holds anti-takeover shares to help ensure ONT can fulfill its potential rather than be gobbled up by a company like Illumina or Thermofisher.

PacBio’s CEO Christian Henry has an MBA background and was a long-time Illumina executive before taking the job at PacBio in 2020. He brought along a number of other Illumina employees to pick up key roles at PacBio. I think Mr Henry has made some aggressive moves, like acquiring short read sequencing company Omniome and sample preparation firm Circulomics. I’m particularly hoping that the Illumina experience of the new PacBio leadership will help them to get their technology out there and drive sales, which is what Illumina excels at.

# Risks

Any savvy investor will realize that investing in unprofitable biotech companies is considerably more risky than a global market ETF. For PacBio and ONT specifically, there are several risks that could lead to a decline in the stock price.

The main long-term risk is competition. Illumina is aiming to provide their own [synthetic long read sequencing technology](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/long-read-sequencing.html). While this has been touted by some stock analysts, I share the [skepticism of other scientists about Illumina’s technology](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2022/01/illumina-teases-two-glittering-enigmas.html), which relies on stitching together short reads. A more realistic threat may be that Illumina drops their short read prices since they can no longer compete on sequence accuracy or length. This could take some sales from long read companies, but for many applications the benefits of true long reads are essential. PacBio and ONT are also direct competitors and it’s likely that one of them will emerge as a winner sooner or later. I’m hedging against this by holding both. My personal assessment is that currently PacBio has a more 'production-level' product and better customer service but ONT has the superior technology.

A short-term risk is that macro headwinds further depress prices of growth stocks in 2022. A potential hedge against this is to spread out investments over this year. Although I may well be wrong, I personally think we are close to the bottom on biotech stocks based on reasonable valuation multiples and continued growth in the face of supply chain issues and other headwinds. 

Finally, both companies have high institutional ownership. ARK Genomics is the biggest PacBio shareholder with 10% ownership and the IP Group owns 14% of ONT. I don’t see a major long-term risk in this, but ARK and IP Group could eventually decide to dump their stock. Some might also see the high institutional ownership in both companies as a vote of confidence. For instance, Oracle bought a $190M stake in ONT last year and Tencent was also an early investor. All this is good to know, but overall the ownership of PacBio and ONT doesn’t impact my investment decisions in either direction.

# Conclusion

PacBio and ONT have unique industry-leading technology and are poised for rapid growth in the expanding market of DNA sequencing. With a total addressable market estimated at $40B and combined 2021 revenues of $300M, PacBio and ONT have lots of room to aggressively grow their market share against incumbent Illumina. Long reads are becoming longer, cheaper, and more accurate and provide fundamentally more useful information than Illumina’s  short reads that currently dominate the market. My long-term thesis is that long read sequencing technology won’t entirely displace short reads, but will increase its market share tenfold or more in the long term. The 2022 biotech sell-off has provided an attractive entry point to initiate a long position. And that’s why I’m going long on long reads.

*Disclaimer: I’ve allocated 8% of my portfolio to ONT and 5% to PacBio. I aim to hold over 10 years, rebalancing if changes in technology or valuations justify it. Do your own DD and let me know your thoughts.*",2022-04-28,148,81

At this time, I would classify the ticker as being in an “orange zone” after a 30% drop from the peak. For those that are new to some of my posts I usually showcase stocks that currently are or have been trending on social media and give them zones based on volatility. Right now DWAC is in trading in a range that is a red flag for me, personally.

&#x200B;

**Red Zone** = High volatility, poor risk/reward.

**Orange Zone** = Medium-high volatility, better risk/reward entry point.

**Green Zone** = Lower volatility, risk/reward most likely in my favor.

Here’s what I have for DWAC.

&#x200B;

For my personal risk tolerance, DWAC \*might\* have a favorable entry point somewhere in the green zone and $60 range. Anywhere above this zone and I feel my preservation of capital will be at risk. Time will tell where it ends up on this one.

# Now for this week’s watchlist

A few stocks caught my attention last week. Some are simply over-sold and high IV while others have earnings coming up. I’ll go through the method to the madness below. Keep in mind these options prices will all change Monday at market open, but at least I can gauge what my return will be on each play.

&#x200B;

**dLocal (DLO)**

https://preview.redd.it/9k7wa4lqlhv71.png?width=2444&format=png&auto=webp&s=27aa6377e9179302f3ef2383245469961b626e02

dLocal was on my “buy the dip” watchlist from several weeks ago. I entered a half position then, and now I’ll have an opportunity to average down into a full position or collect premium and lower my cost basis (CB) of my current position. I’ll be looking for a bounce, even the dead-cat kind, after hitting pretty low numbers on the RSI. I see additional support at $45 and my break-even on the CSP will be below that.

Current Stock Price: $47.50, IV: 77%

Earnings: \*Estimated week of Nov 18

Sell-to-open option strike/expiration: $45 strike PUT, 19 Nov, 2021

Return: Collect $2.85 or $285 in premium per contract. Return of 6.3% in 4 weeks, 82% annualized.

Break-even: Should the stock drop, my break-even share price is $43.15, which would be my eventual cost basis.

&#x200B;

**Robinhood Markets (HOOD)**

https://preview.redd.it/n09t3g7rlhv71.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=16d91b3f6a3107d5ae5f601e54f8fd4ca2750c1f

Since the HOOD IPO the stock fell sharply to the low 40’s and has remained there ever since. The support formed at $40 is actually incredible. Robinhood holds a large amount of crypto and with the crypto boom that we’ve seen over the last couple weeks Robinhood’s balance sheet has possibly been one to benefit. Earnings are coming up this week on Oct 26 (Tuesday after market close).

HOOD has highly-anticipated crypto wallets coming soon, a large user-base, and opportunity to expand to new markets.

Current Stock Price: $39.59, IV: 75%

Earnings: 2 days away

Sell-to-open option strike/expiration: $39 strike PUT, 12 Nov, 2021

Return: Collect $3.50 or $350 in premium per contract. Return of 9% in 3 weeks, 156% annualized.

Break-even: Break-even share price is $35.50, which would be my cost basis if I am assigned the shares.

&#x200B;

**Duolingo (DUOL)**

https://preview.redd.it/6zqshczrlhv71.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc213c714853cfbe59e6198989ad6238af6f9c

DUOL dipped two weeks ago and offered a good entry opportunity. I will be looking to play this as an earnings run-up, which means I will be hoping the stock has a good showing going into earnings. I will be selling before the earnings event.

Current Stock Price: $178.26, IV: 73%

Earnings: Nov 10

Sell-to-open option strike/expiration: $170 strike PUT, 19 Nov, 2021

Return: Collect $10.50 or $1,050 in premium per contract. Return of 6.2% in 4 weeks, or 80% annualized.

Break-even: Break-even share price is $159.50, which would be my cost basis if I am assigned the shares.

&#x200B;

**Riskified (RSKD)**

https://preview.redd.it/r64685hslhv71.png?width=2450&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd0c4378ee18b6be72b2f7e08e62d79badf37f90

RSKD is another recent IPO with a share-pricing date back in August. The stock saw a strong performance in September, but has since taken a tumble to below it’s IPO price. In my opinion RSKD has a good business model and I am willing to open a starter position using a cash-secured-put.

Current Stock Price: $18.74, IV: 87%, RSI: 40

Earnings: Early December

Sell-to-open option strike/expiration: $17.50 strike PUT, 19 Nov, 2021

Return: Collect $1.00 or $100 in premium per contract. Return of 5.7% in 4 weeks, or 74% annualized.

Break-even: Break-even share price is $16.50. RSKD would need to drop an additional 12% for this position to get assigned.

&#x200B;

**Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA)**

https://preview.redd.it/da42ky0tlhv71.png?width=2456&format=png&auto=webp&s=b093e204b328af3f621078cd5405dc912ba8cfe0

This merger (with SPAC ticker SRNG) has been highly volatile and is the most risky play on today’s watchlist. IV is extremely high due to the volatility and DNA is down 10% since last week. Notable holders of the stock are Cathie’s ARK ETFs.

Personally I feel this is still in a moderate-risk “orange zone”, but if we get a continued dip down to the 50 EMA (orange line), I will look more meaningfully for an entry.

Current Stock Price: $13.14, IV: 100%

Earnings: Unknown

Sell-to-open option strike/expiration: $12 strike PUT, 19 Nov, 2021

Return: Collect $1.20 or $120 in premium per contract. Return of 10% in 4 weeks, or 130% annualized.

Break-even: Break-even share price is $10.80, which would be my cost basis if I am assigned the shares.",2021-10-25,110,34

For the past decade genetics has been undergoing a veritable revolution, with rapid advances resulting most recently and spectacularly in the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19.  I think that in the next few years the stocks for genetics corporations will consistently outperform the market; in the past month on Robinhood alone I made over 30% investing almost entirely in genetics stocks.  On the whole, over the next decade and probably more, genetic and biological technology has a lot more room for relatively rapid advancement than weed companies (its just crop after all) and Tesla that get a lot of interest on Reddit.

I didn’t look at the mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BionTech, because mRNA vaccines have side effects associated with the carrier lipids they require to dissolve into your cells and also they require a robust cold chain, and also because I don’t see why an mRNA vaccine would automatically have any functional advantage over a DNA vaccine; they’re both hacking the central dogma of molecular biology in order to generate antigens, DNA vaccines are just one step higher in the flow of information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I. Inovio vs AZN/ChAdOx animal-model results comparison**

First, I’ll discuss the papers published in May on animal models from Inovio and AZN/ChAdOx, mainly focusing on the mouse work since that’s the model system overlap between the two papers. Of course by the time you read this, AZN clinical trials will have dropped, but this is still a useful exercise because (1) it allows comparison to Inovio (2) it allows comparison to Altimmune and Vaxart, as both of these are also adenovirus-vectored vaccines.

[Inovio paper on INO-4800 in mice/guinea pigs, published May 20th](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16505-0.pdf)

[ChAdOx paper on their vaccine candidate in mice and monkeys, published May 13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205088v1.full.pdf)

A. *Some basics on the difference between the INO and AZN approaches:*

AZN/ChAdOx: this effort uses a replication-deficient, recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) containing CV19 sequence to get CV19 virus DNA into your cells, where it can be read out into proteins that provide the antigens the immune system recognizes. The ChAd adenovirus vector itself is produced in cell culture, using cells that express the missing component of the ChAd so the CV19-recombinant and replication-deficient virus can reproduce itself.

Inovio: Inovio uses a DNA plasmid that gets into your cells via electroporation, using a [proprietary device the have been developing for a while](https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010137). Once it gets into your cells it does much the same thing as ChAdOx: expresses copies of the CV19 spike protein that can then be chopped up and presented on the surface of the cell, to be recognized by your immune system.

There are some advantages to Inovio’s approach: it’s easier to make and purify high quantities of DNA plasmids compared to growing and purifying replication-deficient virus. Inovio’s vaccine is room-temperature stable, ChAdOx tolerates room temperature but is better stored refrigerated or frozen and then kept cold once thawed. Inovio’s also doesn’t invoke any anti-adenovirus immunity (more on that later) so it can be injected many times with no ill effect, and the electroporating injection device is supposedly [pretty much painless](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/13/science/vaccine-coronavirus-inovio.html).

A downside to both is you have to wait a week or more to develop the immunity, unlike say a subunit-based approach like NVAX’s.

B. *Neutralizing antibody titers in BALB/c-strain lab mice:*

(“The virus neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum which still inhibited virus replication” according to the ChAdOx study, I believe this is the general convention)

[Inovio Fig.4a](https://i.imgur.com/qsGnttD.png), ~92 (using a lab-modified CV19 pseudovirus), compare to [ChAdOx Fig. 1b (red)](https://i.imgur.com/YU5YM1S.png) of ~40. 

*INO > AZN, but not by a lot*

*However, for Inovio, if we look at some other mice strains, and wild-type CV19 strains, and also guinea pigs which were used because they are considered a model system for human skin (important for Inovio’s novel electroporation injection method), we see higher to much higher neutralizing antibody titers.*

[Inovio p3](https://i.imgur.com/YQGXf52.png).  Read the text, it’s just a para. It says using live CV19 strains on the same BALB/c mice, instead of 92, Inovio found neutralizing titers of 97 and 128 respectively for the wild-type CV19 viral strains. Using another lab mice lineage called C57BL/6 and wild-type virus, they observed neutralizing antibody titers of 340, and for guinea pigs, they found a neutralizing AB titer of 573.5 using pseudovirus, and >320 for wild-type virus. 

[ChAdOx](https://i.imgur.com/P1Jjz3L.png) also immunized an additional mouse strain, achieving neutralizing antibodies of ~80.

It should be noted that Inovio immunized mice twice and guinea pigs were immunized 3 times. 

ChAdOx mice were only immunized once. But there is a good reason for this. ChAd stands for Chimpanzee adenovirus- it uses 
 in addition to the logistic difficulties of producing large amounts of adenoviral-vectored vaccine. the ChAdOx/AZN vaccine can induce anti-vector immunity- as discussed in the intro [here](https://jvi.asm.org/content/86/20/11031), seroconversion (immunity) against the vaccine adenovirus vector (carrier virus) can occur after a single injection. This may cause side effects, and/or it may reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. This is why ChAdOx tried to get away with only using a single injection. There is no such problem with Inovio’s approach.

C. *T-Cell responses, INO vs AZN:*

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells (“CTL”; CD8+) and T helper (“Th1”; CD4+) cell counts via ELIspot analysis of interferon-gamma:

>[ELIspot assay for IFN-gamma](https://www.rndsystems.com/products/human-ifn-gamma-elispot-kit_el285#:~:text=This%20ELISpot%20assay%20employs%20a,binds%20secreted%20human%20IFN%2Dgamma.) 

This assay allows counting of cells secreting IFN-γ. 

>“IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops.” [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_gamma) 

With this in mind, and as the ELIspot assay is preceded by an activation step where extracted immune cells are exposed to antigen peptides, the ELIspot assay is a measure of activated T-cells.

Inovio p6: “Day 7 post-INO-4800 administration, we measured T cell responses of 205 and 552 SFU per 106 splenocytes against SARS-CoV-2 for the 2.5 and 10 µg doses, respectively (Fig. 8a). Higher magnitude responses of 852 and 2193 SFU per 106 splenocytes against SARS-CoV-2 were observed on Day 10 post-INO-4800 administration.”

ChAdOx [Fig. 1c (red)](https://i.imgur.com/YU5YM1S.png) had ~2500 SFU, so pretty similar.

However, when looking at cytotoxic T cells, which are particularly important for virus resistance and immune memory, it seems in mice, the Oxford vaccine was significantly better: 

Inovio p7 left: “The T cell compartment [was found] to contain 0.04% CD4+ and 0.32% CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Supplementary Fig. 3).”

ChAdOx saw  cytotoxic T-cells relative abundance at 1% in BALB/c mouse, a three-fold advantage for ChAdOx in this system, and 1.5% for CD1 mice. CD4 T-helper cells were at 0.4%, a ten-fold advantage for ChAdOx.

I’m not quite sure if this difference is due to a difference in preparation of the samples, but the methods seemed similar to me.

D. *AZN macaque monkey results*

Finally, rhesus macaques. The ChAdOx neutralizing antibody titers for monkeys were only around 20 compared to 100-500 for Inovio mouse and guinea pig results, and IFN-gamma T-cell counts only around 50 SFU, as opposed to thousands for Inovio and ChAdOx mouse results.  [Fig 2 from ChAdOx vaccine for rhesus monkeys](https://i.imgur.com/vLZxHgh.png). These results are not great. I think I’ve heard they may have given the monkeys a mistakenly low dose, or maybe it was the human clinical trials. Whatever. Anyway, the intramuscular injection of ChAdOx induces lung and serological immunity, it does not prevent infection in the upper respiratory tract, and still allows asymptomatic illness and transmission. All depends on human clinical trial results.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**II. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines that target the mucosa: Altimmune and Vaxart**

(Side note: you may be interested in [this comparison](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/08/better-coronavirus-stock-altimmune-vs-vaxart.aspx) between the two companies)

With respect to Altimmune, there were two studies that came out last week, week of 7/12. One, a [preprint study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205088v1.full.pdf) from a non-Altimmune research group that came out Friday 7/17, and two, [a study from earlier in the week that was an Altimmune collaboration](https://www.uab.edu/news/research/item/11426-altimmune-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-tested-at-uab-shows-positive-preclinical-results), which used animal models to generate preclinical data on Altimmune’s intranasal vaccine candidate, AdCovid.

AdCovid is another Adenovirus-vectored vaccine like ChAdOx. However, unlike ChAdOx, it does not get injected into your arm, it is basically an nasal inhaler. It is this that appears to offer some key advantages. The tl;dr for intranasal adenovirus-vectored vaccine seems to be that it actually allows for sterilizing immunity in the upper respiratory tract, rendering the immunized completely immune and unable to get infected or transmit the disease asymptomatically.

Since we don’t have any published data for Altimmune’s AdCovid, I’ll be looking at the preprint study from an independent group. They first did a study where they did an intramuscular injection of a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine, and then measured much the same things as the Inovio and ChAdOx studies did ([methods text](https://i.imgur.com/lPHxeDR.png), [figure 1 caption](https://i.imgur.com/T7aDSU3.png), [figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/RAO3pez.png)). 

Just to contextualize let’s look at the some numbers here. First, neutralizing antibody numbers, figure 1E. They gave the numbers in a slightly different format, but if I understand correctly, this version of the ChAdOx vaccine yielded neutralizing ABs of 316 on one injection and ~500 with a booster. For T-cell responses, it doesn’t look like this study did an ELIspot analysis, but looking at Fig 1G, we can see the CD8+ (cytotoxic, antiviral) T-cell percentage was around 0.8%, so roughly around what the ChAdOx vaccine produced. 

I’m not going to go into the details of the rest of the 7/17 paper, since there’s nothing to compare it too. I’ll just quote the headlines:

1. “**Intramuscular immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung.**” They did a challenge study with intramuscular injection and found that like the ChAdOx study, this approach prevented disease in the lower respiratory system.
2. “**A single intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2.**” This is the big result, and the result the ChAdOx study was unable to achieve in macaque monkeys.
3. “**A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S conferred superior immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose.** Given that the serum neutralizing antibody responses was comparable, we hypothesize the greater protection observed after intranasal delivery was because of the mucosal immune responses generated.”
4. On page 15 they discuss some limitations including possible problems with anti-vector immunity, that will bear watching in future studies. However, given that they were able to achieve immunity with only a single treatment, even if humans will seroconvert against the vector, once is enough.

**So in summary, an Altimmune-style vaccine was able to achieve better immunity overall compared to ChAdOx-style, and more complete immunity, because Altimmune-style were able to get the upper respiratory mucosal cells involved in immunity. **

To me, this seems huge. If it holds true that immunization site matters a lot as far as what parts of the body develop immunity, then the best vaccines will be ones that immunize the upper respiratory mucosa. This means Altimmune’s AdCovid, whatever vaccine the preprint study is developing, and possibly Vaxart as well. 

Vaxart is interesting because they combine Inovio’s room-temperature stability with AltImmune’s mucosal targeting, as they are a pill form of another adenovirus-vectored vaccine. Because your oral mucosal lining communicates with nasal mucusal, this ostensibly should be similar to AltImmune’s nasal spray. (I guess the unoccupied niche would be an eyedrop-based recombinant adenovirus vaccine? They say CV19 can infect via the eyes so…) 

Vaxart completed a Phase II oral Flu vaccine study [earlier this year](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30584-5), with results that beat the standard live-attenuated Fluzone vaccine (not 100%, but apparently no flu vaccine is). Novavax comes to mind; I’m not sure they’ve published their results, but [here](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-nanoflu-achieves-all-primary-endpoints-phase-3-clinical) is a press release about Novavax’s promising Phase 3 results.

Vaxart was chosen for [Warp Speed funding for a nonhuman primate challenge study on June 26](https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxarts-covid-19-vaccine-selected-us-governments-operation-warp), and [expects to begin a Phase I trial this summer or sometime in Q3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/20/2036357/0/en/Vaxart-Announces-Selection-of-its-Oral-COVID-19-Vaccine-Lead-Candidate.html). 

Altimmune is [planning to start a Phase I clinical trial in Q4](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_F5AcRYosZ4J:https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2020/07/13/altimmune-making-headway-with-covid-19-programs.html+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). 

So these promising candidates look like they may at best be longer-term plays. **However, if ChAdOx is confirmed to work well in humans, these adenovirus-vectored vaccines should also get a boost.**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#tl;dr:

Inovio has significantly better neutralizing antibody results in mice compared to ChAdOx, decent T-cell counts as measured by IFN-gamma comparable to ChAdOx results, and ok T-cell counts when measured by flow cytometry, with cytotoxic T cells 1/3 of that of ChAdOx. However, with ChAdOx’s very poor macaque T-cell results, it remains to be seen (at the time of writing) whether the adenovirus-vectored and intramuscularly injected ChAdOx approach will translate with people.

Inovio has the advantages of being shelf-stable and easy to manufacture, and isn’t very far behind ChAdOx in terms of timelines. Also, there is no concern with anti-vector immunity for Inovio; it remains to be seen whether this is a concern for ChAdOx. Since we haven’t seen otherwise, there is the chance that Inovio will be better in primates than ChAdOx. It’s also possible they’re the same or worse. Some people think Inovio’s vagueness in their press release a couple weeks ago means they didn’t have great results, although I don’t really believe that and I just think they didn’t have time yet for the timepoints to all be reached and analysis done; and also they seem to prefer to publish, rather than press release, their results, unlike Moderna.

Altimmune and Vaxart may be even better plays, but have longer time horizons, with Phase I not likely to start until Q3 or Q4 2020, *but* they may benefit in the nearer term if adenovirus-vectored vaccines are shown to be effective.

Positions currently, probably will change soon:

ftobn0_DNA,DNA,DNA Sequencing and You (Or Your Parents),"Illumina currently holds a vice grip on clinical DNA sequencing. They have competitors in the field, notably Ion Torrent and Pacific Biosciences. The major factor separating Illumina from its competition is its low error rate in calling inserted nucleotides. This low error rate is especially important in calling DNA variants which are prognostic, for instance, in cancer. In germline variant calling, as opposed to somatic (cancer) variant calling, you have many observations of a single nucleotide from which to base your evidence. In cancer, you're limited by both tumor purity (how much of the DNA you're sequencing is cancer) as well as base quality. Given Illumina suffers the least from base quality issues, it is well-poised (and is already in use) for clinical applications.

Currently the uses for Illumina technology are relatively isolated. If you walk into a big name cancer institute like Sloan Kettering or DFCI, your DNA is getting sequenced before you get to the front desk. At a less specialized or less advanced hospital this might not be the case.

So how will Illumina expand its market? It could target these smaller institutions, which is reasonable. The other thing it could do is demonstrate that its technology can be used for the early detection of cancer. This is important because if you detect cancer early, your prognosis is better. If, for instance, Illumina developed technology that could detect cancer from a patient's blood, then every American is going to wind up getting this test once every year or so. That's a big fucking market.

Well guess what? Illumina's spinoff company Grail Inc just published the first convincing evidence that they are able to do this. 

What's even better? Grail is using bisulfite sequencing for their technology which is even more hampered by error rates in sequencing. This leaves one option for the platform that these millions of diagnostic tests are going to be run on.

Illumina.

New Products for 2019

First Quarter (Q1) 2019 - NEO plans to release an already developed oxygenated water, in one of the hottest drink sectors with a nationally known bottler/copacker.  More details to follow.

DNA Energy & Coffee

DNA Energy, which was launched in 2007, was in the marketplace until 2014.  During that period, it generated substantial revenue, won multiple awards and had sales in several states among many major retailers.  Under Mr. Rubin’s leadership, guidance and direction, DNA Brands fully intends to revive DNA Energy Drinks, focusing primarily in select and niche markets, also tweaking the formula, geared towards Organic reformulations.   To begin with,  Mr. Rubin plans to do this by leveraging many high profile relationships and partners he has nurtured over the years. 

Planned launch of products in the United Kingdom

“Through our partnership and shareholders of SRP Equipe Ltd., plans are well underway to launch NEO Superwater, and subsequently the company’s full line of products during 2019,” stated Rubin.  SRP Equipe Ltd., consist of a group of retired and current professional soccer players, based in the United Kingdom, led by Lateef Elford-Alliyu, who have far reaching and long standing relationships across the UK, EU and Africa.
