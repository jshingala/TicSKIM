1bns31f_DUK,DUK,Duke Energy DUK,"Duke Energy (DUK) is a solid dividend payor. 4.3% yield. Annually increasing dividend. Underlying business is a large, regulated utility. It's not going 

For people needing to withdraw a steady amount of their portfolio, say 3-4%, DUK seems like a no-brainer. I've been investing in it for 20 years and have seen steady dividend growth and share prive appreciation. 

Anyone have any comment on this stock? ",2024-03-25,4,6

NEE seems like a great company and spends alot ond R&D. 

I personally use DUK and they are the dominant player in the Midwest. They are pretty solid to work with too.",2024-01-22,8,8
184upz8_DUK,DUK,Looking at Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) & Duke Energy,"What's your target ROCE when considering your long-term holdings? I've held DUK for over 12 years, but at a now-sub-5% ROCE, by that measure, it's not doing it for me anymore. Only 2.45% share appreciation over the past five years. Starting to sour on utilities in general, which makes me want to strengthen my positions in energy sector dividend raisers. My average position's ROCE is ~12%. DUK's 4.52% yield is keeping me loyal, though. For now.",2023-11-27,0,2

zkrnbc_DUK,DUK,Key levels of DUK,"Yesterdayâ€™s market was going crazy without any sign of it, and DUK also got a little bit of power to go beyond the key levels.

Talking about the key levels, I am currently holding DUK and I found one daily basis support at 96.56 because I see 4 lows at around that line (the blue circle), even though it was broken two times in recent two months, I think it should still be effective because prices stayed around there for several days while trying to breakout. 

I found another key level at 101.81 which is daily basis key level 1. It might not be as strong as the previous support, because I see only 2 lows and 1 high (the red circle) that the price gets successfully supported or resisted. 

Daily basis key level 2 is found at 105.80, because four green circles show that the price has a hard time either going beyond or below too much of the line. 

For now, the price has gone above the line yesterday, but so far, I cannot be sure the key level 1 has been broken, might need to wait for today to see if there will be a callback, maybe the CPI data will give me an idea about to hold or to sell.

Just a rookieâ€™s idea, looking for any comments about the key levels.",2022-12-13,1,0

I am wondering if Tesla Solar Roof can become popular to the point it will hurt the revenue of companies like Nextera and Duke. If anyone things this has a high probability of happening, when do you think it would be time to jump out of this energy providers companies' boat?

j2b5ge_DUK,DUK,NextEra Energy approach Duke Energy to takeover,"I was looking to add NEE to my portfolio after the stock split later in October. I feel like long term, they are a solid company that has increased their dividends for the past 5 years and has a good presence in the power generation sector.
I was wondering what everyoneâ€™s thoughts were on this stock for dividends even with acquisitions? Would this create a situation where they would need to decrease their dividends due to new debt? Still a good long term hold? Thanks!

I currently donâ€™t own any shares of NEE or DUK.

4usvbv_DUK,DUK,Duke Energy (DUK) has been my highest performer at 12% and I have seen nothing but gloomy outlooks the whole time I've owned it.,"I put $30k in Duke about 2 months ago, (same day as a post on SA called [Now is not the time to buy utility stocks](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3978060-now-time-buy-utility-stocks)) at $76.58 And so far it's my best performer, up around 12%. My reasoning at the time was that it payed a good dividend, and there was nothing apparently fishy about the business, and it had taken a recent dip in price. This is also the largest stake I've taken in anything so far.

All I've seen on SA the whole time is people bashing it either for being too expensive, or being too boring. If I've learned anything at all, It's that you can't judge much of anything from Seeking Alpha. At least maybe not about established utilities.

Anyways, it dropped 1.5% today and I'm debating whether it's a good idea to throw some more money at it tomorrow morning.",2016-07-27,1,9

15ot8x_DUK,DUK,Duke Energy Options Question,"Clearly I'm missing something.  I'm looking at Duke Energy Corp (DUK).  The stock is currently trading at $63.01, but a $20 call option with a January 2013 expiration has a bid price of $1.00 (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=DUK+Options).  Does that mean that I can buy the contract for $100 and have the option to buy the shares at $20 in a month?  If the stock stays flat, or even slides a bit, I could make a huge profit.  What am I missing?
