I‚Äôm looking for a VPS that‚Äôs:

* Beginner-friendly ‚Äì I know how to use MT4 and TeamViewer but don‚Äôt have advanced server experience.
* Reliable ‚Äì I need it to run MT4 24/7 without connection issues.
* Entry-level ‚Äì Nothing overly complex or expensive, just a solid, stable option for hosting MT4.

What are the best platforms?

1ijh0dl_F,F,Can anyone help with MT5 EA moving SL of open positions please?,"Evening all,

I've tried everything I can find in the code base to try and modify the SL of open positions opened by my EA and nothing seems to work.

The EA prints all the debugging info and recognises when price has reached the threshold for change and even shows the correct price that the new SL should be at, but doesn't actually change the SL in the strategy tester or live.

The EA is a simple range breakout strategy that uses Mark Douglas logic from trading in the zone to open three positions at once, Trade A, B and C. Where trade B and C moved to breakeven when Trade A hits take profit.

Thank you in advance.

So why not just buy XLC directly? Because in my view, **the sector as a whole is overvalued**, mainly due to **META and GOOGL** inflating the valuations. This is just my personal strategy, of course.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American‚Äôs trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA‚Äôs holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%‚Äîits worst drop since 2008. Flagship¬†*EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while¬†*Dragon Age: The Veilguard*¬†missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren‚Äôt biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips‚Äîthe tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren‚Äôt sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:¬†¬†Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn‚Äôt hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC‚Äîkeen on keeping prices high‚Äîmight be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump‚Äôs blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn‚Äôt escape Trump‚Äôs crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel ‚Äúhundreds of billions‚Äù into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? ‚ÄúMake it in America or pay the price.‚Äù While allies bristled, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American‚Äôs trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA‚Äôs holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%‚Äîits worst drop since 2008. Flagship¬†*EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while¬†*Dragon Age: The Veilguard*¬†missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren‚Äôt biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips‚Äîthe tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren‚Äôt sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:¬†¬†Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn‚Äôt hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC‚Äîkeen on keeping prices high‚Äîmight be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump‚Äôs blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn‚Äôt escape Trump‚Äôs crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel ‚Äúhundreds of billions‚Äù into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? ‚ÄúMake it in America or pay the price.‚Äù While allies bristled, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.

SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips‚Äîthe tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren‚Äôt sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:¬†¬†Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn‚Äôt hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC‚Äîkeen on keeping prices high‚Äîmight be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump‚Äôs blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn‚Äôt escape Trump‚Äôs crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel ‚Äúhundreds of billions‚Äù into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? ‚ÄúMake it in America or pay the price.‚Äù While allies bristled, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:¬†¬†Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn‚Äôt hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC‚Äîkeen on keeping prices high‚Äîmight be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump‚Äôs blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn‚Äôt escape Trump‚Äôs crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel ‚Äúhundreds of billions‚Äù into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? ‚ÄúMake it in America or pay the price.‚Äù While allies bristled, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.

* Fueling the rally were President Trump‚Äôs comments at Davos, where he called for lower interest rates and cheaper oil, spurring midday momentum. Nvidia ended the day flat after supplier SK Hynix flagged weak chip demand, weighing on the sector. Wall Street stayed optimistic, with the S&P leading the charge into the new year.

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American‚Äôs trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA‚Äôs holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%‚Äîits worst drop since 2008. Flagship¬†*EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while¬†*Dragon Age: The Veilguard*¬†missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren‚Äôt biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips‚Äîthe tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren‚Äôt sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

1f5r7ci_EA,EA,EA portifolio ,"I am considering running backtests on the best 150-200
EA's from MQL5 market, and buy the best 5-7 performing
EA's.
By best performance i mean lowest DD, and consistent
4-6% a month.
So the thought is: Have a portifolio for of let's say 6 of the
most consistent EA's. Spread 400K usd out equally on the
6 bots, so 66.667 USD in each bot.
Have a stop loss of 40% on each bot, so those of them,
that runs martingale/grid doesn't ruin 1/6 of the portifolio
if it blows.
Let's say that the average monthly return is 5% for the ea
portifolio. The first month it will pay around 20.000 usd.
If one of the EA's in the portifolio is very unfortunate one
month, and hit the SL of 40%, that would only mean the
entire portifolio is hit with 40% of 1/6 = 6,67%. When the
portifolio is averaging 5% a month, it will only take a
month and a week recover after a SL is hit.
I think, if I find the best EA's on MQL5 market, that
averages 5%, normally they would only hit a 40% DD = SL
every 3-7 years.
With compounding interest, and diversification by
investing in 6 bots, i can't see why this would not be a
good investment in the long run.

1e8e2bi_EA,EA,Ea trading strategy advise,"Kind colleagues, I have an automated EA system which works well and i dont need to watch market as it‚Äôs set by conditions and is open to losses aslong as it‚Äôs profitable in the long run.

but found some hmmm‚Äôs‚Ä¶. the strategy is just to follow an 10sma on a chosen timeframe set with automated sl and tp ratio of my choosing, once a trade hits tp a new order opens at the tp of the previous trade

but the issue is once a trade hits tp, sometimes trend continues which is good and the newly opened trade profits nicely; but quiet often it seems; due to previous trade moving so far and hitting tp, the new order usually retraces back to sma which whipes out my positive risk ratio fully and sometime by more, E.g 1:3 / 1:6 successful

strategy follows sma10 EA so it often enters a new trade at the top / exhausted part of a trend, it opens 1 buy or sell each time 

The EA follows trend bias untill price flips back below the sma10 which indicated a bearish trend bias and begins then opening sell orders.

To attempt to solve the exhausted trade openings Iv even tried 1:1 to keep distance not to far away but due to the nature of 1:1‚Äôs it usually results in overall loss or breakevens over course of multiple automated newly opened single trades 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, I like my entry and strategy and how a new order is opened right after the previous one with its own risk management in place, but once a trade wins it‚Äôs a bit challenging as I know it may incure a good few losses untill price gets back below the tight sma10 to indicate a new trend bias‚Ä¶ 

strategy can lose like 3-10 times in a row if a previously successful move happens (previous trade) and moves extremely far from sma (buys in the uptrend yet, price retracing to the sma stops out multiple single opened buy orders until bias flip E.g) 

Iv tried using larger risk ratios to make up for the losses but it didn‚Äôt work; losses seem to out weight previous positive risk ratio even though price is trending above sma, tried smaller risk ratios to keep distance not to far after each success to try avoid exhausted price and both arnt very consistent 

I make sure my wins are larger then losses. But the multiple (sma10 trending pullback losses ) takes away the good ratio It seems.

When it‚Äôs a successful day this strategy takes in a very very high win rate and profit rate. 

Iv tired trading different market conditions too‚Ä¶
Trending markets = excellent and also terrible reversals 
Consolidation markets = excellent and also terrible reversals lol 

1st trade is fine as I‚Äôll take a couple loss untill ea finds the right trades on its own and captures a decent profit offsetting the startup loss, the problem is the newly opened ones after tp is hit, I‚Äôm tryna figure out 

also wanna keep the same method of opening one after another completes.

Apology if this is longly typed out lol ,

Thank you for reading this far üôá 


What kinda simple programmable (brand new trade orders; after the previous successful trade) could work to limit the loses when price is above sma trend but ina Retrace back to the sma, (as price hits tp a new trade opens to capture extended profits) 

been pondering for so long, tried having a reverse trade at end of the first trades successful hitting of its tp but when I tried that, the price always continued! So that‚Äôs how I got here where after a successful trade happens, a new order opens in same direction based on trending condition sma10 but now it‚Äôs reversing most times! Feels like once I change it it does oppersit lol 

Any ideas for automated trades one after another? Iv seen ppl do them before successfully and like this method of trading but wasn‚Äôt sure how they kept consistency üôèüôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ",2024-07-21,3,9

No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year‚Äôs earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company‚Äôs main expense (advertising).

This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.

Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).

Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one.

That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap.

But on the MT5 demo charts, it shows the same trend as the TradingView charts. 

My question is, for the backtesting, will it show the same as what the live charts is showing? And when doing some forward testing for the demo account, I need to adjust the settings on the indicator so it will show the same as what the live charts is showing? I should also adjust the settings on the TradingView to match what the MT4/MT5 trend showing on the charts?

1b2knaw_EA,EA,"EA to lay off 5% of workforce, or about 670 employees","Electronic Arts
 announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games.

EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.

The company‚Äôs announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. 

On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent‚Äôs Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is ‚Äústreamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.‚Äù

The cuts will support EA‚Äôs ‚Äústrategic priorities and growth initiatives,‚Äù according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be ‚Äúsubstantially complete‚Äù by the end of December.

‚ÄúWe are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,‚Äù Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. ‚ÄúWe are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.‚Äù

Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its ‚Äúbiggest opportunities ‚Äî including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.‚Äù 

During the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.

18hiu60_EA,EA,Electronic Arts (EA) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

The gaming industry has been gaining notoriety in the news lately, with the MSFT-ATVI acquisition and the hype around NVDA boosting the stock prices for the gaming industry as well. EA, in particular, investors have been overly bullish on them. I believe that the current EA model of acquiring studios to acquire their IPs is ill-fitted for the gaming industry considering the success stories of other game developers e.g. Riot, Valve, etc all relied on having a champion cash cow. EA's problems go beyond just their business model, their largest cash cow the FIFA series has recently ended its partnership with the FIFA organization and spun off into EA Sports FC, the success of EA Sports FC is uncertain now that the main body overseeing football no longer backs the FIFA series.

&#x200B;

# REVENUE:

There has been a paradigm shift in how EA will approach its business model, EA wants to make players more interconnected. ‚Äúhaving more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio‚Äù - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. So, going forward their focus will be on making their large titles feel more interconnected rather than buying new and smaller titles. 

EA has split revenue into 3 tranches,   
‚ÄúFull Game Download‚Äù, ‚ÄúPackaged Goods‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLive Services and Others‚Äù  
‚ÄúFull Game Download‚Äù refers to virtual downloads of the game released by EA.  
‚ÄúPackaged Goods‚Äù refers to hard copies of the game that EA sells to a third party.  
‚ÄúLive Services and Others‚Äù refers to DLC.

***FULL GAME DOWNLOAD***

When forecasting Games Released, I'm uncertain to what extent EA will execute their new paradigm shift so to avoid making incorrect assumptions I assumed that the number of titles EA released would be in line with historic averages.

When forecasting Revenue/Game, given that management‚Äôs guidance was to focus on older and bigger IPs to create a community. I assume that sales of new games grew at historical averages before tapering down to grow in line with inflation.

***PACKAGED GOODS AND LIVE SERVICES***

When forecasting Live Services and Others, I opted to use a nominal Y/Y to reflect the uncertainty in this arm of revenue. As Live Services and Others are only driven by a few popular and older titles e.g. Apex Legends, FIFA, etc. I assume that Live Services grows in line with historic averages as EA figures out how best to grow their community before there is a slight ramp-up in growth and then tapering down to grow in line with inflation until perpetuity.

# COST:

***R&D AND COST OF GOODS SOLD***

When forecasting R&D and COGS, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends and took the historical averages.

***MARKETING***

When forecasting Marketing, ‚ÄúOperating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases.‚Äù - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. I assume that Marketing will increase to an elevated level to support more marketing for older flagship IPs and remain elevated till perpetuity.

***G&A***

When forecasting G&A, given that EA has stated their desire to build out communities rather than developing more and more different kinds of games, I assume that G&A remains constant till perpetuity.

***OTHERS***

When forecasting Others,  I opted to follow historic trends and assumed that it would continue till perpetuity.

# WACC:

***COST OF EQUITY***  
US bond rating of AA+

Market Value of Debt = 1917M

WACC = 8.91%

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value EA at $110.76 per share. I believe that EA is overpriced and their IPs are not as valuable as Investors make them out to be, especially after considering the fact that there is high uncertainty revolving around their most successful IP, FIFA. The uncertainty of how successful their main IPs like Apex Legends, Starwars, and Battlefield can be after the shift in business model leads me to believe that the stock is overvalued.

163nf7b_EA,EA,Is it possible creating a bot/EA that recognise patterns?,"
Let me explain more. First of all, let me precise that I have no experience whatsoever with coding, so in case what I plan to do would be easy to code, I might try to learn and to do so, otherwise I would probably hire someone to do it for me. So please in your answer specify if it would also be easy to code rather than just if it would be possible or not. To make it short, I trade the forex market, gold and also indices. My trading is based on price patterns and market structure, and I trade on small time frames (2m, 5m, 15m). I have hundreds and hundreds of screenshots of the trades I took, if not more than a thousand, and I keep adding more of them day by day.

Electronic Arts is cutting 6% of its workforce, equal to about 800 jobs, and reducing office space, the video game company said Wednesday.

‚ÄúAs we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,‚Äù CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a note to employees. Layoffs are ‚Äúthe most difficult part, and we are working through the process with the utmost care and respect,‚Äù he wrote.

The company expects to take impairment charges ranging from $170 to $200 million, according to a filing with the SEC. EA expects the actions associated with the restructuring plan will be ‚Äúsubstantially complete‚Äù by the end of September.

Wilson said EA would provide severance and health care to affected employees, noting that layoffs had begun earlier in the quarter.

EA had just under 13,000 employees, according to a quarterly filing in March 2022. In January, the company missed estimates on quarterly revenue and provided a bookings forecast that was weaker than expected.

Chief Financial Officer Christopher Suh said on the earnings call that EA will be ‚Äúvery deliberate,‚Äù with a particular focus on the ‚Äúpace of hiring.‚Äù

A company spokesperson declined to comment further on Wednesday‚Äôs announcement or to provide an exact number of job cuts.

EA joins a long list of tech companies that are in downsizing mode. The economic downturn and market reversal led to mass layoffs in 2022 and a more rapid pace of cuts this year. Over 155,000 tech industry workers at more than 500 companies have lost their jobs in 2023, according to data from Layoffs.fyi.",2023-03-29,813,109

The first time I saw a youtube clip from a VTuber, I couldn‚Äôt believe it and I thought that I was watching a historic revolution unfold in front of my eyes. I thought that might be the beginning of something closer to a[ Ready Player One](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/) world. Then, when I saw the tech behind[ CodeMiko](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMiko/videos) and others like[ Xanadu](https://youtu.be/wSx472esQps), I immediately started to study how I could get into that market and invest in what I thought could be a big part of the future: Motion Capture (MoCap) in general, animation software, facial/gesture recognition.

Meta has been burning billions on the Metaverse and they really think this is the play for the long term. If that ever happens to take off, MoCap tech is a market that could benefit in an absurd way from that whole new universe (no pun intended). Zuckerberg might be a lot of things, but I don‚Äôt think the guy is stupid. I believe he wouldn‚Äôt be investing as much as he is on that play if he didn‚Äôt have a very strong reason to believe that it will pay off dividends. Remember: this is the same company that saw the opportunity with Oculus back in 2014, in the same 1-2 year span when the Google Glass was flopping hard and a lot of people were still claiming the VR market was a gimmick that would take several decades to take off.

**Introduction:** 

[Movella Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MVLA)](https://www.movella.com/) is a company that ‚Äúcaptures, digitizes, and analyzes movement‚Äù, as they put it.

They are a leading full-stack provider of sensors, software, and analytics that enable the digitization of movement and have achieved a strong presence in existing growth markets of entertainment, health & sports, and automation & mobility. They have partnered with leading global brands such as Electronic Arts, EPIC Games, NBC Universal, Netflix, Daimler, Siemens, and over 500 sports organizations. *Longstanding* customers include Electronic Arts, NBC Universal, Daimler, and Siemens.

Relevant to my ‚Äúpreface‚Äù section, they are extremely well-positioned to leverage substantial opportunities as a provider of critical technology for emerging markets like the Metaverse, next-generation gaming, and live streaming applications.

From my research, it appears that everyone\*\* seems to compliment Movella‚Äôs products for the same reason: they are extremely easy to setup, very low hassle, low maintenance, low footprint, and they just work. Apparently, the reason for a lot of this praise (at least in relation to their Xsens tech, which gets a lot of real estate on their website and social media) is that they use a different technology compared to other companies, focusing on inertial technology instead of sensors. This means you don‚Äôt need an elaborate capture rig or to book time in a studio, saving tons of money and hassle.

Basically, their sensors, software, and wearables can be used in a LOT of ways. I see this as a ‚Äúnot putting all your eggs in one basket‚Äù type of situation, where the company has clearly diversified their efforts into several different industries and has shown that their products can be applied in a large number of very different ways, from pure entertainment in the Metaverse, to underwater robots, and even potentially[ helping to reduce sports injuries](https://www.movella.com/resources/cases/performance-improvement-sport-insight).

**Potential Risks**

I think most of the obvious risks here are related to AR/VR tech going wrong in one way or another. The two most likely cases that I could see happening are the followng:

* 1 ‚Äî This kind of tech getting a bit too involved with government authoritarianism (e.g., social credit score systems using facial/gesture recognition) and the global population recoiling against its use for a long time, with potential for regulators cracking down on it
* 2 ‚Äî The Metaverse being such an immense flop that the AR/VR industry becomes heavily tagged as nothing more than gimmick by the wider public, drying up interest and investment in that market

**About these, my thoughts are:**

As for number 1, I think this is a legitimate concern. However, even then, companies in this market would still continue to service clients in the movie and gaming industry for the most part. 

So, even if the ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù potential would end up stiffled for a while, I think it would still be ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù for the most part. But it‚Äôs hard to predict with these kinds of things.

And, as for number 2, the Google Glass has already flopped. It was a big thing, everyone was talking about it. And then it flopped SO HARD that it ended up basically killing the AR wearable industry for a few years and raising massive concerns over privacy from the public and from regulators at the time. This time around, I believe the technology is going to be way harder to stop and stiffle. I really think the cat is out of the box with this one (just like with AI, but that‚Äôs a different conversation).

I mean, just go to youtube and type in ‚ÄúGawr Gura‚Äù. Then look at the huge success from Half Life: Alyx. I think VR is coming to stay, and even if the Metaverse turns into the biggest flop of our generation, gaming VR and other adjacent uses will still likely be flourishing.

Aside from that, the side of Movella‚Äôs business that relies more on the movie industry looks decently safe to me. Movies will likely be relying more and more on CGI (e.g., new James Cameron Avatar), and that usually requires a lot of mocap work and other kinds of movement digitization tech.

**Recent Highlights**

* [Listed on NASDAQ less than a MONTH ago](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/13/2606462/0/en/Movella-Announces-Trading-of-Common-Stock-on-Nasdaq-Global-Market.html)

Yes, this is still pretty fresh. They have recently entered into a business combination deal with Pathfinder Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: PFDR), a special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC).

Taking this one from[ Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/movella-global-leader-digitization-movement-120000992.html):

‚ÄúThe combined entity, to be known as Movella Holdings, Inc., will have a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $537 million. The capital raised from the transaction will be primarily invested to further scale and grow the business, which will continue to be led by Movella President and CEO Ben Lee when the transaction is completed.‚Äù

Movella has been backed since inception by Kleiner Perkins and also counts GIC and Columbia Threadneedle as core investors. Existing shareholders of Movella (including Kleiner Perkins, GIC and Columbia Threadneedle) have rolled 100% of their ownership into the combined company.

The transaction is supported by $75 million of committed financing from affiliates of Francisco Partners (‚ÄúFP‚Äù), a leading technology focused private investment firm with over $45 billion of cumulative committed capital.

**Final Thoughts**

I‚Äôve been bullish on mocap, 3D capture, and facial/gesture recognition tech ever since I first learned what VTubers were. It just seemed like an industry that could get very large in the future with more VR advancements. Then, Ready Player One happened, and recently Meta announced their enormous investments on the Metaverse. All of these things have only been signaling more and more the immense potential of this industry.

Movella is a company that is taking advantage of this growing market, and has long standing customers like Electronic Arts, NBC Universal, Daimler, and Siemens. They are a leader in the motion capture market, and they are making big plays in several different industries, but they are definitely doing especially well in the entertainment and mocap world.

Obviously, this is **NOT** financial advice and you should always do your own due diligence. But my sentiment regarding the industry is positive, and I do think this is an interesting company that should not be overlooked by anyone looking to invest in the VR/Metaverse world, or just looking for interesting tech with potential in several different areas.

I know that a lot of you are seasonned / highly technically-skilled devs and algo traders, and as such am not too sure whether the context around my question will be relevant, still, I wonder what you think about the substance of it?  


# CONTEXT

I have started to play around with EAs on MT5. It looked like an easy, low/no-code, way into algo trading. After doing a bit of research and using demo accounts, I have been using the popular (? is it really?) Dark Venus EA, which strategy is based on Bollinger bands.

It seemed pretty simplistic / almost dumb to only use Bollinger bands as trading signals and I wasn't expecting much but I have to say that after spending a bit of time setting up the bot and backtesting it, the results looked promising.

I know that people have a tendancy to run backtests on data-sample size and settings that are too ""fitted"" but I ran those backtests for every year since 2013 (I am not sure that I have the correct data past that point) and on several currency pairs.  


# BACKTEST RESULTS

Here are is the backtest results for 2022 until Dec. 23 (EURUSD M1 starting with 1000 USD deposit):

[EURUSD M1 2022 Backtest \(Graph\)](https://preview.redd.it/ht8t0yqwvn8a1.png?width=1905&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf0f9de7b21d3fae8cf73b9b4a9c4199ad32b0e)

And here are the returns and drawdowns of the same EA config every year from 2013 on both EURUSD M1 and GBPUSD M1:

The results seemed promising and with only 1 or 2 years of ""acceptable"" negative returns the risk/reward seemed like something that I could live with and I wanted to start forward testing.

Some of you will surely point out that it looks like I have a Martingale grid management on and I do. The martingale multiplier is set at 1 though, hence not triggering an actual martingale-type behaviour in trending market conditions.  


# FORWARD TESTING WITH LIVE BROKERS ACCOUNT

So I have been running the EA since late November, and here are the results a month in:

[Forward Testing EURUSD Dec. 2022 M1 \(Graph\)](https://preview.redd.it/3g74fbs9yn8a1.png?width=1658&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a7a5363e2636c02027cc66df3307e42600231ba)

[Forward Testing EURUSD Dec. 2022 M1 \(Data\)](https://preview.redd.it/usiqbjbdyn8a1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10e223d76a31c0fb70246a32cbb7347e2d90cb2)

Just for the sake of complete transparency, I was doing a bit of manual trading at the beginning, which explains the ""larger"" move around beginning of December.

I am quite impressed with the results so far but I can't shake the feeling that I am missing something. That it cannot be ""THAT"" simple. How does this stupid strategy of buy on lower bollinger band / sell at higher band be profitable?  


# THE CRUX OF MY QUESTION

The only thing that makes sense is that the money management that I built thanks to the (quite extensive) parameters that are available with the Dark Venus EA are doing all the heavy lifting there. I can only assume that an EA using ""smarter"" / more refined trading signals but a strong money management would probably be doing even better.

What do you guys think? Is money management the most important part of any algotrading strategy? Have you had experiences / have you been running ""simple"" strategies that were performing well only thanks to the money mangement built into the strategy?

Are my assumptions correct? or am I missing sometinh stupid and am about to lose $1000?

I am very interested in your feedback. Thanks to anybody that takes the time to read this and want to share their two cents.

Have a great and very profitable week ahead!!",2022-12-28,40,54

Long story short I have been trading for about 2 years and have a strategy that I have developed that has been providing an avg of roughly 30R per week and is very mechanical (little to no subjectivity)

I'm not able to trade london due to my timezone so I'm interested in building an EA to trade it for me, and was wondering if you'd recommend that I learn quantconnect and python or better to learn MQL4/5?

Nature of strategy is:

1. Avg of 3 trades per day across 3 pairs and 2 sessions (London and NY)
2. Avg winner holding time of 45 minutes
3. Uses multiple timeframe analysis
4. It's more ""SMC"" (hate that term)
5. Execution is on the 1M timeframe, sometimes 15S
6. I hold full volume to TP, no partials, but move sl to BE

&#x200B;

If anyone has any insight in the best way to approach, would be appreciated!

* ATVI: $1,481m (*down $585m or 28.3%*)
   * Bookings were down primarily due to Activision (-*$438m or -49.2%)* along with Blizzard *(-$209m or 43.3%)*
   * Decrease is primarily due to Call of Duty & World of Warcraft
* EA: $1,751m (*up $261m or 17.5%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $80m or 42.8%; due to FIFA '22 and some of that has to do with y/y release timing but overall FIFA is still a strong & solid franchise for EA*)
   * Live Services (*up $181m or 13.9%; primarily due to a couple of acquisitions that EA made*)
* TTWO: $846m (*up $61m or 7.8%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $95m or 39.1%; they released WWE 2K '22 & Tiny Tina*)
   * Recurrent Consumer Spending *(down $34m or 6.3%, TTWO mentioned ""the consumer has  seen a wide array of long-awaited, high-quality  new releases in the market* "" *so this probably meant Elden Ring*)
* General Takeaways:
   * ATVI is struggling due to lower engagement with Call of Duty, Warzone, and World of Warcraft
   * EA & TTWO were able to grow bookings due to new game releases compared to PY, but live services engagement was low likely due to competition from Elden Ring

   * Net Bookings could be higher at 9% - 12% growth if it wasn't for FX headwinds (*3pp*) & stopping sales to Russia (*1pp*)
   * The growth is due to lapping acquisitions from the prior year (*Playdemic & Glu*), live services growth especially for Mobile (*Apex Legends Mobile launch, FIFA Mobile growth, and Lord of the Rings launch*), and some major IP that we'll have to wait for more details on
* TTWO: $3,750m - $3,850m (*up $342m - $442m or 10.0% - 13%*)
   * Largest contributors expected to be NBA 2K, GTA Online, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Online, Tiny Tina‚Äôs Wonderlands, Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Suns, and PGA Tour 2K23
   * This does not include Zynga and TTWO will share updated guidance at the next earnings call

si1psq_EA,EA,EA Earnings - Need Assistance with Trade Structure,"I'm a bit new to options and I need help with the best way to structure my trade to best profit from the upcoming earnings announcement. A bit late in the day - but I still think there's some value so long as the trades are placed before the end of trading today. 

&#x200B;

Here's my prediction: 

EA will miss on revenue mostly due to poor sales of Battlefield 2042 during the holiday season. There's already some rumors circulating that sales were poor and that there were quite a few requests for refunds. This article covers the bulk of what I'm saying but take it with a heaping mound of salt - just like most gaming related news: [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/01/ea-disappointed-battlefield-2042-free](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/01/ea-disappointed-battlefield-2042-free)  .  I think the setup will be similar to what happened to EA's stock price after Q4 2019 earnings came out.  However, there is a wildcard that gaming companies are being bought out left and right - so a buyout announcement would totally destroy this trade. (Just my lay opinion)

So I suppose puts would be the way to go. But they are of course super pricey due to general high IV of the turbulent market and because earnings are today. Is this the time to use spreads? Sell some OTM puts and then buy ITM puts? Complicating things further is that EA is already down about 2% today so puts are even more expensive. 

Also - how far away should my expirations be when playing an earnings announcement? Should they just be for this week? I have no idea about the long term prospects of this company so I don't have any care to be long or short after tomorrow. 

I'd welcome any opinions on trade structure or my prediction.",2022-02-01,4,5
sdhqtg_EA,EA,Is anyone else very bearish on EA?,"EA saw a huge runup on the 18th going along with Activision being purchased by Microsoft. I do not think EA has a chance of being purchased by them as Activision had a few very strong things going for them:

1/4th of the PE of EA

Troubles of CEO and workplace sexual assaults that would be fixed if a company bought them out

Getting talent (also likely fixed by being bought out)

However, EA has been struggling hard and failing to deliver on content. From what I can see, FIFA and Apex Legends are their two biggest titles. Apex is competing against Warzone which has been very well received and its new season has made it very popular. 

Recently, EA announced that parts of Battlefield 2042 will become free to play because the game is quite literally dying. Battlefield only has a 5k(!) average for the past 24 hours on steam. Unless they have a huge unexpected revenue stream to make up for Battlefield's terrible launch I cannot see them hitting their estimates and having good guidance. They also, from what I know, do not have any strong content in the pipeline to make up for their current drought. 

Macroeconomic conditions are also not very favorable but I think that is for another discussion.

&#x200B;

**Q3 '21 Bookings vs the prior quarter:**

* ATVI: $1,880m (*down $41m or 2.1%*)
   * Bookings were down primarily due to Activision console & PC (-*$152m or -24.2%; I believe this is due to churn to Apex Legends due to their lack of a solution for anti-cheating while ATVI believes it was due to last year's tough comps*) mostly offset by Blizzard (*$60m or 13.9%; they released Diablo*) and King (*$17m or 2.7%; Candy Crush & advertising*)
* EA: $1,851m (*up $515m or 38.5%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $414m or 146.8%; they released FIFA '22*)
   * Live Services (*up $101m or 9.6%; which I believe is primarily Apex Legends benefitting from WarZone churn*)
* TTWO: $985m (*up $273m or 38.4%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*up $85m or 38.4%; they released NBA 2K '22*)
   * Recurrent Consumer Spending *(up $189m or 38.4%, benefitted from GTA Los Santos Turner update & NBA 2K engagement*)
* General Takeaways:
   * Excluding new game releases, TTWO & EA were able to sequentially increase bookings from the prior quarter while ATVI did not.
   * ATVI is losing engagement for WarZone while EA & TTWO are doing well.

&#x200B;

**Full Year Bookings Outlook vs prior guidance:**

* ATVI: $8,650m (*unchanged*)
   * I believe there is some downside risk given World of Warcraft & Call of Duty may see continued gamer churn to New World, Apex, Legends, and Battlefield 2042.
* EA: $7,625m (*up $225m or 3.0%*)
   * That $225m was for Live Services only, which likely reflects Apex Legends taking share from WarZone.
   * I noticed they didn't change their expectations for Full Game Downloads including Battlefield 2042, which I'm bullish on given community engagement
* TTWO: $3,300m - $3,400m (*up $100m or 3.0%*)
   * Looks like NBA 2K & GTA engagement has been better-than-expected despite tough comps from last year's lockdowns & this year's reopening economy
* General Takeaways:
   * I don't trust ATVI's guidance for bad reasons (*CoD & WoW churn*)
   * I don't trust EA's guidance for good reasons (*the CEO mentioned BF 2042 early access event was the largest they ever had & feel very good about player demand, yet didn't bump Full Download guidance*)
   * TTWO is doing just fine

&#x200B;

**Latest Price Targets after updating my forecasts:**

* ATVI: $59
   * 10x multiple on FY EBITDA of $4,022m
   * That $4,022m is aligned with management's guidance, but giving a lower multiple due to near-team guidance miss from WoW & CoD churn, delaying OverWatch 2 & Diablo, and a penalty for poor management with workplace issues
   * If I bumped that multiple to 25x, my price target would be $137. But, I don't see the market giving that multiple anytime soon until the pipeline is back on track & there is more confidence in management.
   * Very undervalued for long-term investors that are patient for a turnaround if I bumped the multiple back up.
* EA: $167
   * 25x multiple on FY EBITDA of $1,915m
   * Upside from Battlefield 2042 and is my #1 conviction for the short-term
* TTWO: $225
   * 35x multiple of FY EBITDA of $728m
   * Higher multiple since it's the largest metaverse company on earth that the stock market isn't fully appreciating, GTA 6 upside in a few years, & could be an attractive acquisition target for big tech that want a top player in gaming & metaverse with a digestible market cap (*only $21 billion*)

qc2ltl_EA,EA,Long Electronic Arts ($EA),"**Long Electronic Arts ($EA)**

Electronic Arts develops and sells video games. IP includes games such as Battlefield, The Sims, and FIFA.

A substantial portion of EA‚Äôs revenue is generated from *Ultimate Team* in EA‚Äôs sports games. Based on last FY, *Ultimate Team* brings in $1.62b or 29% of EA‚Äôs total revenue. In *Ultimate Team* gamers can collect digital player cards and build their own personalised team. Buying digital loot boxes with real money is a way to speed up that process.

On June 18th, EA [introduced](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-21/news/pitch-notes-fifa21-preview-packs) *Preview Packs* to *Ultimate Team*. These new type of loot boxes lets the player see what‚Äôs inside the loot box before buying. My thesis is that these new loot boxes are underappreciated by EA‚Äôs investors. The general idea here is that opening one of those loot boxes is like playing the casino, and EA is drawing more players into the casino by now handing out a free first round of loot boxes every day. To see why this works, just imagine what would happen with Philip Morris if it was able to hand every single human a couple of free cigarette puffs every single day!

The introduction of *Preview Packs* is seen by [some](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-18-ea-adds-ultimate-team-loot-boxes-that-let-you-see-all-items-before-you-buy-in-most-significant-shakeup-of-fifa-series-in-years) as EA‚Äôs response to the increasing pressure from governments about the link between loot boxes and (underage) gambling. My firm opinion is that *Preview Packs* will generate more, and not less, revenue for EA.

The beauty of all of this is that the additional revenue from *Preview Packs* translates almost fully into bottom-line profit. Distributing one additional DIGITAL loot box comes with almost zero additional costs for EA. Revenue = profit. *Preview Packs* will thus lead to a significant boost in EBIT. To put it all in perspective, EA‚Äôs last FY revenue was $5.63b of which $1.62b *Ultimate Team* revenue, and EBIT is $1.05b. Let‚Äôs conservatively assume that *Preview Packs* leads to a 10% boost in *Ultimate Team* revenue. That‚Äôs $162m. Add that to EBIT and EBIT grows by 15.5%. That‚Äôs some nice operating leverage.

About timing. *Preview Packs* were temporarily available during the EURO2020 tournament for \~6 wks following June 18th. In earnings call 1Q2021 (qtr ending June 30rd), EA indicated that preview packs were successful and that they‚Äôve seen increased engagement and higher rate of conversion. *Preview Packs* were then made available on a permanent basis with the launch of FIFA22 on October 1st. Because of *Preview Packs*, I expect *Ultimate Team* revenue will break records and market expectations. I expect to remain long for at least 3 months, waiting for 3Q2021 earnings (qtr ending December 31st) that should demonstrate the profitability of *Preview Packs* to EA‚Äôs investors.

Note that my investment is purely based on a puzzle piece that I think the market is missing. I have no view on the remainder of EA‚Äôs business but am nevertheless exposed to this. I am just betting on the market missing the *Preview Packs* puzzle piece. Thus, I might lose my bet for other reasons than being wrong on my investment thesis (e.g. Battlefield2042 might flop or EA correcting from a possible overvaluation). Nevertheless, I like the bet.

# My Conclusion

>Both companies show an extensive growth, whether its financial or popularity among their fan base, but after considering all factors, **Activision Blizzard has the upper hand**.  
>  
>Even though, it may seems that EA release more games then ATVI, has a diverse library of successful games.  
>  
>moreover, after looking at both companies financials and growth indicators, it appears that ATVI's revenue growth is much stronger than EA's, and with a bigger gross profit to be considered .. my winner is definitely  **Activision Blizzard**

mmz37b_EA,EA,Help Creating EA Using TradingView Closed Source Indicators,"Hello All,

I have a few questions regarding creating an automated strategy using TradingView closed source indicators on MT4 and MT5, and I thought this would be the best place to post.

I am trying to create an automated system using my strategy and indicators that I use. I analyze using TradingView because that's where the indicators I use are, and they are only on TradingView. I use three indicators, all of which I am unable to see the source code.

I was thinking about merging the indicators to create an alert that will go directly to Telegram, like ""BUY EURUSD,"" when all three indicators line up. I have software that opens, closes, and manages my trades from MT4 using Telegram, so getting it to Telegram is the hard part. All I need to do is create one alert when all three of the indicators line up. Is this possible? Has anyone attempted this before?

I am trying to see if it's possible to create an automated system using closed source indicators. I have seen a few people do this before, but no one is getting back to my emails or messages. I also asked the developers for the source code indicators, but it was obviously a no.

I would love to discuss any thoughts or ideas because I can't be the only one wondering how to do this with TradingView's vast public indicator library.

Thanks!",2021-04-08,1,0

l4o7yw_EA,EA,"Rumour: Tencent raising funds to buy EA, Take Two","[Article](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/77498/report-tencent-raising-billions-to-buy-ea-take-two-or-others/index.html)

&#x200B;

Tencent already owns major parts of the digital entertainment market, and has stakes in other studios, including Blizzard-Activision. While EA would be a tough buy, Take-Two would be an easier target to purchase.

&#x200B;

While for the gaming market and gamers in general, this bring a loom of another generation of nickle and dime games, there's a second aspect that I feel isn't brought up: market monopoly and control. How often do governments prevent the sale of a private or traded company to a Chinese entity? To prevent the control of a resource or the disruption of free market in favor of exclusive exports to China? I remember the case of Potash Corp - about 7-10 years ago - where the Canadian government had to step in out of fear the mine would be exploited and the raw material all sent back to China with a disregard for the free market and demand.

&#x200B;

Then why are government letting software and entertainment companies being sold? Most IT and telecom hardware companies out of China are banned on network equipment and as government vendors. Digital entertainment has as much if not more reach on devices. Given - network hardware is a much greater threat as it can bring down entire communication networks, but contaminated devices are just as useless once bricked. 

&#x200B;

If TikToc was such a *great* threat, why is Call of Duty, WoW, Clash of Clans on the same list? They're all owned (in part or entirely) by Tencent. Tell me, how many PlayStation and Xbox are on US army bases world wide? And just in the ""known"" bases? Okay - you could say this is crazy thinking, which it probably is, but the question remains: why allow Chinese take over of software while preventing hardware?

&#x200B;

And, I'll be honest: I'm using the national security argument primarily to come to the defense of the gaming industry. EA sucks, their business practice have Wall Street in mind and not gamers, but EA owned by Tencent is going to suck even more from an entertainment perspective.",2021-01-25,1,9

>The NFL has announced a partnership with Take-Two Interactive brand 2K to produce multiple future video games in what will mark a return of football-themed games to the 2K brand. The deal revives a previous partnership that has been inactive since 2004 and promises non-simulation football game experiences that will begin launching in 2021.

TTWO end of day at 4:30pm will skyrocket.

Even modest gamers that aren't sports fans knows about the EA NFL deal, which took **NFL competition away and only allowed EA to make NFL games with brands** (otherwise you had to make up your own teams like the Washington WSB lolcalls, vs. the Deported Chicago Bearingtons)

NBA however, did not let EA grab the exclusive license, and as a result **EA's NBA live lost marketshare overtime to 2k's NBA2k,and went on break for years, than coming back reformatted, flopped, and is now on absence again.**

With Madden bumbling many of the last 10 NFL games, including the 25th anniversary edition which was terrible an sold like crap, **it seems that the time of EA exclusivity has come to an end**. People will ***buy the new 2K NFL games in droves***, and unless EA spends more money and changes strategies, their Madden series will end up just like NBA live.

**This also shows that the NFL has seen the sales numbers and performance of TTWO games compared to EA,** to want to break off the deal. Not only do 2K games, especially sports games, sell well, ***but in game purchases are often much more than what you see from EA across all genres***\*\*.\*\*

Why it is interesting:

1. Resilient against pandemic effects and in line with massive long term trend of game and entertainment
2. Having strong brand and customer loyalty
3. Compatible with multi platform thus strengthen point number 2
4. High Profit Margin - High ROIC, compounder candidate

Dive little deeper:


I. Competitive advantages
Wide range of genres, including IP based on first-person shooters (Battlefield), role playing (The Sims), racing (Need for Speed), strategy (Command and Conquer), and the strongest - sport (FIFA), etc


II. Strong Balance Sheet:
1. $5,7 B cash vs $1 B total debt  
2. Growing retained earning
3. Undervalue by assets, accounting doesn‚Äôt record value of its EA brand like Plant vs Zombie, The SIms, Need for Speed, FIFA, etc - providing comfort cushion for investor


III. Profitability and Cash Flow:
1. More than 50% profit margin - more than 30% ROIC
2. $1,8 B Operating Cash Flow annually - only small portion ($0,15 B) of that number spent as capex


IV. Valuation at a glance:
EV/CFO around 18,3 (EV/EBITDA give similar number)  means to acquire the entire entity investor should wait around 19 years, not my best price to buy. Undervalued by balance sheet but need more bargain to buy if considering its earning power",2020-05-14,8,0

&#x200B;

Interestingly, Borderlands 2 and Civ 5 are still in the top 100 most active games on Steam, despite their sequels being out. I have no way of figuring out DLC sales, so I‚Äôd assume that these games also have additional sales based on that. There‚Äôs also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch‚Äôs most popular games.

&#x200B;

**Other competitors:**

Taketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we‚Äôre all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft‚Äôs CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn‚Äôt as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.

&#x200B;

**Financials:**

No long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They‚Äôve continued to repurchase their stock.

&#x200B;

**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that. IV is also fairly high right now for their options.

fk7mj1_EA,EA,Simple trend oscillator EA,"TLDR; Learn from scratch or pay to get a code to build off

I have a strategy I traded manually last semester on forex that netted me some gains. (Around 3 percent over 40 trades). Unfortunately I no longer have the tabulated results so take it as you wish.

The strategy only profited around 40 percent of the time at what was ideally a 2 to 1 risk. Problem is I can't really evaluate the efficacy for it because it took almost a couple of months to make those 40 trades on 1 min timeframes on forex pairs. Not to mention all the liberties I took exiting early.

I intend to try to make an EA out of this on MT4 so i can really test it in a truly mechanical environment and learn from the shortcomings/advantages of this strategy. But I am not proficient at coding, I only know abit of C++ and MATLAB. So I am considering either going at it myself or hiring someone to code it for me (Python -> ZMQ -> MT4).

Heres the strat: It might be stupid but I think there will be alot to learn watching it fail.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gOuUCGjfqcvEmSfbI1REEUBN-UWlUf0J/view?usp=sharing

Basically, it uses ATR for the exit sizes, Bollinger band and MA crosses for entry and direction. If it closes out of the money it will wait until the MAs cross before entering a trade again. Only one trade will be opened at one time. This is a pretty vanilla idea that can be found all over the internet tbh. But I want to see how and why it wouldn't work.

&#x200B;

* The best-selling PlayStation 4 video game title in 2016 was FIFA 17, which sold 10.03 million units. (source: VGChartz, 2017)
* EA‚Äôs *FIFA* is built on an arsenal of real-world data. Professional soccer consists of 800 teams (comprised of 18,000 players) across a variety of countries, and each is represented in-game (source: Western Digital blog) [https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/](https://datamakespossible.westerndigital.com/meet-data-master-ea-sports-fifa/)
* FIFA 19's ""Ultimate Team"" made up 28% of EA's revenue last year ... just one portion of the FIFA video game series (source:"" PCGamesN) [https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fifa-ultimate-team-revenue)
* 95% of the planet's purchasing power is outside the U.S. and soccer, for some strange reason, is popular in countries not named ""U S of A"".

Below, you will see the stock chart from last year for the week leading up to the FIFA 2019 release. While the chart doesn't show it, 52 weeks ago, the stock had gone down 1%, then climbed a little more than 5% going into the release, for a total of a 6% climb. Now, previous behavior is not indicative of future behavior, and we have FOMC coming up which will affect the markets as a whole.

**My suggested play:**

Take a small position tomorrow (Tuesday, Sept. 17). After FOMC, consider DCA'ing into your position and ride your calls into TendieTown^(TM). Offload those motherfuckers on ~~Monday~~ Thursday, Sept. 26. Ride the hype, and sell DAT NEWS!

‚ÄúWorldwide  player spending in EA‚Äôs mobile titles totaled an estimated $180 million  last quarter, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes at $53.4 million or  about 30 percent of the total, according to mobile measurement firm  Sensor Tower.‚Äù

Most of the posts on r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes today are from whales saying they are done spending, and from people saying they are leaving the game. 

So, uh, yeah. The game that is responsible for 30% of EA's revenue just lost it's leadership and has a massive player base protesting and requesting refunds because there is widespread cheating and EA has known/not addressed it. That can't be good for business.

bdiuap_EA,EA,The Case for $EA. Baby's first DD on WSB,"The case for EA


Management

Forward looking, conservative management. ¬†I know that it is all the rage to hate EA. However, they seem to have learned some hard lessons over the last year. They have driven monetization in video games and they flew too close to the sun. ¬†I think that they have learned their lessons as evidenced by the new Star Wars game having no MTX and the releasing a f2p battle royale with no pay to win. However, they still drive monetization in their sports games and while there is community unrest all revs are growing with FIFA having its best quarter ever. EA beats earnings most of the time because they use conservative estimates. ¬†This is great when they surprise launch a game that happens to be very successful. (Apex Legends 88 metacritic) In addition to conservative forecasts they delayed release of Battlefield V(81 metacritic) and launched into a much more competitive window in order to release a better game. They made a wise choice that hurt sales but protected the brand. This shows that management is looking forward past a quarter. ¬†It also helped make a bad quarter which is setting up our current entry. They are also in the middle of 2.4b buyback.

Apex


Apex Legends. Quick Numbers: 50mm players/ 92mm rev first 30. ¬†This is insane for ‚Äúnew‚Äù ip. Apex is always a top 10 twitch streamed game. ¬†It will not dethrone fortnite but we don‚Äôt need it to. The first 30 days did not have much to buy on the store and there was no battlepass, so 92mm was pretty impressive. ¬†If they can continue it will contribute 1.1b in high margin revenues. 

Remember how we talked about conservative management from EA? ¬†They did not price in this game. Here are two different quotes from their Feb 5th conference call one day after the games release: ‚Äúwe put very little revenue into this quarter for it because we just didn't know. But by the time we give guidance in May, we'll have a much better sense of what we think that will be based on the number of users coming in and then those users that are spending across the live services that we'll continue to roll out.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's just so early. We don't want to put too much into the model yet. And it's really not built -- when I gave that guidance earlier on, low single digit -- or mid to low single digits for the total business, that doesn't really anticipate a huge number for our lives service business yet.‚Äù 

The battlepass was released to a community hungry to buy it on 3/19 @ 9.99. ¬†We heard the game made 92mm in the first 30 which would bring us to ~3/7 which leaves 24 days left in the quarter for store rev and 12 days of battlepass sales. If they continue on their original 92mm pace that is 70mm+battlepass sales. ¬†I think that regular store numbers will go down but again, very little of this rev is priced in.

Margins of Apex. ¬†Being digital only and being released on origin for pc means that margins are higher than traditional games. ¬†While EA did not elaborate on the margin spread it is estimated to be around 70% console and 95% pc vs 50% for physical. A 30% margin boost off the top makes revenue numbers that much more impressive.

Apex Expansion: ‚Äúwe are looking at how to take the game to mobile and cross-play over time.‚Äù I think that crossplay will increase the player base and hopefully they can get it done. Im unsure on what Apex looks like in mobile form but it has my interest.


Anthem

What a disappointment with a silver lining. ¬†Management was conservative on mtx forecasts but not on disc sales. ¬†They estimated 5-6mm unit sales in their call but in articles Im seeing they predict 37 million by 3/31. ¬†I dont know if I‚Äôm misunderstanding something here but either way Anthem was the best selling game in February and it was only out for 6 days. I think march sales data will show a sharp decline (due soon). It got horrible reviews but it seems they might have still moved a decent amount of units. ¬†It will be interesting to see if they can fix its problems before players completely give up on it. Overall im bearish on Anthem. It is reassuring that they didn‚Äôt forecast high ‚Äúlive‚Äù sales

BFV

BFV is now the largest BF game ever according to their recent cc. ¬†They released Fire Storm which is their version of a battle royale on 3/24. BFV is like a train. It‚Äôs not flashy but it has a huge player base that chugs along and makes a profitable ip. I think it will help quelch the potential anthem miss.


New Titanfall Premium game

Titanfall and Titanfall 2 are two of the best shooters ever made. They had underwhelming sales both received critical success ¬†(high 80‚Äôs on metacritic). Apex legends take place in the same universe as Titanfall and uses a lot of the same story, assets, and gameplay. ¬†Given the popularity of Apex a lot of players were introduced to the universe. They are planning on capitalizing with a ‚Äúpremium titanfall game‚Äù in this fiscal. ¬†While I think it‚Äôs rather far off I think its going to be really big given that it will essentially look like a spin off from Apex Legends (even though its really the other way around) given Apex‚Äôs commercial success.


Star Wars Game

They release their new Star Wards game 11/15 and it is being made by respawn currently. ¬†I think that they are the perfect studio for the game and I think its going to be huge. It comes out right before the move and right after the new Disney area comes out. ¬†Star wars hype will be huge and they are taking a very conservative no micro transaction no multiplayer strategy. I think that this is exactly the model to take for this fanbase and will be able to be monetized further in the future. ¬†I think that at $60 a pop they are going to make a killing on this game and set themselves up in the future. Community sentiment for this game and respawn is super high right now and I have bought into it.


Conclusion:

I am rockhard long for $EA and think that it is going to pop. ¬†I think 130 is a conservative EOY PT. I would recommend stock and any calls that expire starting after next earnings (5/7). ¬†I myself have loaded up on 5/17, 9/20, and 1/2020 calls and will continue to do so.


TLDR Im so sure about this that you better be safe and just inverse me and buy as many puts as your margin will allow you.",2019-04-15,29,42

apd3ad_EA,EA,Apex legends = Bull EA?,"EA has recently been rightfully slaughtered for the bad sales of BFV and quite frankly Anthem is looking like a big meh. 

The surprise now being the resounding launch of Apex Legends which I believe they wholly own. The market rewarded EA by going up +17% but what next?

I personally believe that Apex will continue gaining players to justify a buy at this level. Google search trends shows that its comparable to fortnite, twitch numbers are currently above fortnite and the subreddit numbers are comparable (of course fortnite users are younger and reddit trends older). 

Some napkin math.

EA makes roughly 1 billion profit a year. Fortnite apparently made 3 billion off 200 million registered users.
Apex has 10 million registered users so far so if we say they make it to 50m that would add $750m, roughly 70% to profits. Add a bit of PE, market exuberance and the potential gains should be there.

I have a few questions for you guys

What are some ways to guestimate the player base? Correlating social data with the company announced numbers?

What will the userbase number for Apex stall at, more importantly why?

Am I wrong? Whats the bear case?

After repeated delayed release and confirmed under-performance of EA's latest releases Star Wars: Battlefront II and Battlefield V, compounded with increasing likelihood of complete lootbox bans, which accounts for $1.3 bn of EA's annual earning, will be facing complete bans similar to what it has faced in Belgium. Should the ongoing regulations pass worldwide, including proposed regulations in the US senate, EA will be facing approximately $0.8 bn losses in earnings. [2]

Other game publishers relying heavily on micro-transactions have also been impacted by the possibility of a rolling regulation or possible suspension.

9xe6qn_EA,EA,I wanted to make a statement about Electronic Arts's Stock.,"Many people have been waiting until today to buy EA stock in the dip. Its share price has fallen more than 40% since the summer. The reason today is significant is because the next iteration of Battlefield (Battlefield V), one of EA's largest IPs, released today. This game was not received well critically, and is hailed as unfinished and buggy. Recently I have been looking at video game companies as potential investments, and as a person who spent much of high school playing an Xbox 360, purchasing countless games from companies like EA, Activision and Microsoft, I realized that what happened today has become the industry standard.

To make clear what I mean, I am going to describe day one of any online playable video game here: At release avid video game players and fans of a video game franchise are excited to buy the game (your early adopters). These people do not care what the game is like on the first day as long as they get to play it. When a game releases it is frequently a struggle to play it in the first week due to server connectivity issues and availability. This happens with EVERY video game. Even companies with a good track record of releasing ""quality"" games still release unfinished games. Another release date issue is that the game may promise to add a large feature piece of content later.

In my experience playing video games I have been everything from early adopter to late majority and laggard. I am often not disappointed on a release date, but disappointed with how the developer moves the game forward after release. Some games keep you playing with new content for 2-3 years (Activision-Blizard/Bungie's Destiny for example). However, the industry standard has become ""release the game as the infrastructure on which we will build this iteration between now and the next major iteration."" As a customer of game companies, I do not see an issue with this. As a part owner, I certainly do. This would be like if Samsung released a phone without all of the software complete, promising to ""patch it later."" However, that is only a problem because the customers would be outraged. With videogames, the customers do not see this issue.

&#x200B;

In terms of buying EA stock on this major dip. Today could be the day or it could not, but it is a major games company that is going to be sticking around for a while, and its business strategy is going to proceed as it was.

&#x200B;

-First of all, Battlefield V is going nowhere. They had that controversy where they included some weird prosthetic wearing woman in the trailer (also a feature in the game). Upon backlash, an official told gamers just not buy the game. So what happens. Surprise! They don't buy the game. Preorders go down, and they delay the game till november. They also delayed the release of a Battle Royale mode until March. This puts them at a disadvantage with Black Ops 4, which already has more time ahead of it for retail. 
-Second, FIFA (and other sports titles) have lost popularity. People prefer to play fortnite than games like FIFA (again, the lack of battle royale hurts them). With these games in a slow decline, they won't have that steady support to keep then up.

I think this is a buying opportunity because most people don't look at a game's parent company when buying games. Battlefront 2 may be marred, but MTX is still king, and the best selling game right now (Call of Duty) is planning to add in MTX when server issues are fixed. EA will continue to make good games. And Battlefront 2 definitely does not alone account for 10% for EA's valuation. 

The real risk is if Belgium and Europe declare MTX a form of gambling. Other countries have taken the approach of forcing companies to reveal their drop rates when money is involved. I doubt anything beyond that would be considered seeing as Japan and South Korea heavily enforce gaming practices as is, and they haven't even banned MTX.",2017-11-20,61,44

.  
the fact of the matter is: they sold a lot of units. so many it caused their servers to overload. however the problem that was caused is not a concern for investors because it was easily remedied by adding more servers.  
.  
Nowhere in the article did they state EA lost revenue because of this, nor did they mention any lost customers, present or future. And they didn't. It was a temporary disruption in service, and since it wasn't a paid subscription model, revenue was not held up. the units were already sold. the money was already collected.    
.  
when it comes to investing, personal feelings have little to no bearing on a stocks price. just because certain people are angry at a company doesn't mean its share price will reflect it.
