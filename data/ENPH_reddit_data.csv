1d260o8_ENPH,ENPH,Bought a ton of ENPH! Would love to hear your thoughts.,"Actually 1000 shares - 119 average. 

If you don’t know Enphase(ENPH) they’re in Solar industry and does residential/small scale micro inverters, batteries and software for the solar setup. 

It’s beaten down because of the interest rates. Over the last year or more, they’ve rapidly expanded in EU. Their biggest market in US is California and it’s struggling because of NEM 3.0. NEM 3.0 makes it difficult for homeowners to break even unless they install batteries as well. Enphase offers batteries as well and has much higher margin than a typical micro inverter install. 

Why I’ve invested now:

Their guidance is higher than previous quarter earnings, important because they’ve had 4 quarters of declining revenue. Peak of 726 million in Q1 2023 and most recent being 263.3 million in Q1 2024. Their CEO thinks they’ve reached bottom and ready for the next cycle. (I’m sure every CEO is optimistic but he’s a no bull shit guy) 

While their sales in US decreases 34% in US, they’ve increased 70% in EU over the past quarter. Of course, they’re starting very low in EU and increase makes sense but I’m very optimistic. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen with interest rates/inflation in US. Last few indicators seem good and this week’s PCE is going to be super important. 

Needless to say, market is forward looking and this will jump before the action begins. 

Also, ENPH is eating SEDG (their main competitor) market share. Look at the earnings if you like to.

I’ve been watching especially ENPH for quite sometime since like when it was trading 180ish…. I still think that the company offers interesting energy related technology and it has room to grow but the stock chart doesn’t agree with me.

17km6rd_ENPH,ENPH,ENPH now at $78 after Q3 earnings call. How much lower can it go? Two weeks ago at $120 it felt like the bottom.,"I have watched this stock for years and I only recently bought my shares at $126 after seeing it tank from its ≈ $300 ATH. Now the stock is flirting with costing half of what I thought the bottom was. I do think solar energy will continue to grow but I'm uncertain now whether or not ENPH will be part of that. I don't own any of the other solar stocks like Solar Edge, I specifically am interested in ENPH. Is anyone buying? Or should I wait two weeks for the price to drop another 20% /s?",2023-10-31,132,144
17j9wsk_ENPH,ENPH,$ENPH is beginning to look very interesting--opening a small position and watching.,"Enphase has been on my watchlist for roughly six months. I began getting interested when it dropped to about $150. However, at the time, I was accumulating a position in $DG. I'm now fully invested in Dollar General. I've even sold roughly 10% of my stake because of the recent bounce; my position had gotten a little larger than I'd wanted. 

The timing was fortunate. Enphase has now dropped to new recent lows. Closing at $82.09 this past week, it's down roughly 75% from highs. However, I still think it has a ways to go. 

The correction began when the Fed raised rates. If you're not aware of $ENPH, they sell microinverters that allow customers to essentially manage all facets of their solar panel system. They also sell solar equipment, along with battery technology, EV chargers, and more. Anyway, Enphase's customers are reliant on paying over time, which is inherently linked to interest rates. Higher rates = higher repayment terms. Rising rates have destroyed demand lately. The past few quarters have seen Enphase revenues plateau, and now they're falling rapidly. Latest guidance for the next quarter is for $300-$350m, down from analyst expectations of over $500m--an absolutely catastrophic hit. 

The State of California has brought further woes upon $ENPH. They recently allowed utility companies to pay less for the solar energy, which many Enphase customers sell to power grids to make extra money. Lower solar energy prices = less return on investment for Enphase customers = lower demand for product. Adding insult to injury, Enphase, like other solar providers, overstocked inventory in anticipation of continuing demand. 

As with small- and mid-sized lenders, the historic spike in interest rates has caused a veritable black swan event for $ENPH. A series of events that have specifically decimated their industry, and $ENPH is not the only solar company paying the price. German industrial giant Siemens is seeking a government bailout, not least of which because of solar woes. 

But. Solar isn't going anywhere. In Europe, where Enphase has a foothold, solar is growing extremely fast. European government has incentivized if not outright required alternative energy sources in many instances. And Enphase is growing nicely in America as well. The market is massive, and will only continue growing over the coming years as the world moves away from fossil fuels. The economic incentives and legal requirements will only grow stronger. 

Their balance sheet is very healthy. They have far more cash than debt, and they are making far more on their cash (3-month Treasuries, etc.) than their interest expense. Their cash flows for the TTM are nearly twice their net income. It's practically certain that they'll be able to weather the storm. In fact, this black swan event may wipe out weaker competitors and only further open the door to new markets, which is what happens when a bubble pops. Solar is a legitimate industry, and Enphase is a legitimate business with legitimate cash flows. Management believes the market will stabilize and begin to recover in Q2 2024. 

I'm planning to open a position here at roughly 0.5% of my portfolio. I would not call it an investment quite yet. Nothing forces you to scrutinize a business more than taking a position in said business. I believe that sentiment is nowhere near capitulation here. I would like to see the stock cut in half again before I start buying more heavily. I think it's very possible. 

Right now they're trading at 13.85X P/FCF and 19.9X P/E. That may seem pretty damn attractive, but you also have to take into consideration that their FCF will likely crater over the coming months. Lower revenues = lower operating leverage = lower margins. TTM operating margins are 22.8%. If revenues fall to $1.5B next year, I'd peg op. margins at 15%, providing roughly $225m in operating income and $325m in FCF. 

Multiples likely won't remain as low as revenues fall if management is correct about the market recovering in Q2 2024. I'd wager that, with recovery in sight, the market will re-price growth at roughly 25X P/FCF, particularly because they will be able to lean on existing inventory to maintain cash flows. 

But that won't happen until recovery is in sight. I'd like a margin of safety. As a result, I will open my position here at 0.5% of my portfolio. I will nibble as it falls to $60, where I will start buying up to roughly 2-3% of my portfolio. I'm looking for sub-$60 to start buying heavily but would like to see how the next couple of quarters develop prior to doing so. If before then the price falls below $45-$50 during this time, I will likely buy more heavily regardless, as I see Enphase as a patently asymmetrical bet at these levels. The future is too bright for this to last. The prevailing headwinds can't last midst a larger pattern of tailwinds.  ",2023-10-29,53,94

yymj6y_OKTA,OKTA,Enphase ($ENPH) will be the best risk-reward short over the next few months,"I'm going to make this post short, because there's a lot of material out there already showcasing this phenomenon, but tl;dr is that indexes like the NASDAQ 100 have a track record of adding trendy stocks into the index around the stocks' ATH, and end up bag-holding the stock as it's valuation comes back to reality. Examples are: Atlassian, Peloton, Okta, Match, Zscaler, Lucid, etc. over the past 2 years.

That's not to say that they only choose losers, but in situations where speculative, ""story"" companies without the financials to back it up gain massive momentum, it's not surprising to see them lose most of their gains once added. It's not the indexes job to try and sift through the best company based on merit or valuation. Rather it's based on performance and market-cap which is out of their control.

All that being said, $ENPH will be added to the NASDAQ 100 on Monday 11/21 and ironically replace $OKTA. Enphase is interesting because it's an energy company valued like a speculative, growth tech stock. It's nearing its 52 wk-high and on the verge of breaking out to the upside. Unsurprisingly, it's done well this year while energy has done great. When does that narrative change? I'm not here trying to call the peak on the energy rotation, but the odds are good enough for me. The next few weeks are absolutely crucial for Enphase to retain its bullish narrative, but if it cracks it'll come down hard.

I am short $ENPH now, but am cautious of it's performance over the next couple of weeks. It could have a crazy move to the upside in the near-term off of index inclusion momentum and if that happens, I will be adding to my shorts.",2022-11-18,23,38

qv8v18_ENPH,ENPH,"$MAXN Maxeon earnings on November 17, what to expect and how its related to SPWR and ENPH","**The Companies** 

MAXN - Maxeon is a spin off from SunPower that focuses only on manufacturing solar panels.

SPWR - SunPower is a solar solution provider and installer, that is primarily focused on the service installation and operation of solar solutions. Prior to October 2020, SPWR made their own solar panels. After October 2020, MAXN makes the solar panels and is owned as a partnership of TZS, SPWR and Total.

ENPH - Enphase makes batteries, microinverters and software that is used to convert the energy generated by solar panels into usable electricity for your home.

**The Relationships**

SPWR used to manufacture their own panels, but then spun off MAXN so they can have two lines of business with different expenses and revenue streams. ENPH partners with MAXN and SPWR to integrate microinverters into solar panels: https://enphase.com/installers/acm/sunpower

MAXN is primarily sold and installed by SPWR. So if SPWR has a bad quarter, expect MAXN to hurt. And similarly, ENPH is a canary in a coal mine. When ENPH has bad news, it will take MAXN and SPWR with them.

**Historical performance**

Back in April, MAXN put out an awful Q1 and lowered year long estimates. They also coupled this by putting out an offering redeemable at $18. Overall, it was a triple beatdown that saw MAXN drop from $40 to $15. Also, during that drop, there were regular price cuts by Raymond James, a bullish analyst.

In Q3, we have a real interesting mix of sentiment. SPWR had a bad quarter with earnings despite revenue being up. This hurt the stock price by 8%. MAXN had a sympathy slide of about 15% in reaction. ENPH on the other hand blew out investor expectations and jumped 25% and is holding strong.

MAXN in Q2: https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2

Revenue was only up 5% both QoQ and YoY for Q2.

**Projections and Valuation**

MAXN has Q3 revenue projections of $220M, which is 20% higher than their Q2 revenue of $175. SPWR was targeted for $329M in revenue but only hit $323M.

If MAXN hits $220M, and closes the year at $700M in revenue, their P/S ratio would be 1.35. Both CSIQ and JKS operate at P/S ratios of 0.55. SEDG operates at a P/S of 10, but SEDG offers more products in a higher margin space.

I think unless MAXN blows it out of the water, we can expect a price slide back to $18.

**The company catalysts**

The biggest bet on MAXN is the end of the polysilicon contract that they current have which was obtained above market:
https://stockspinoffinvesting.com/spin-offs/maxeon-solar-technologies-deep-dive/

The catalyst for MAXN is that the contract for their above market polysilicon supply is going to expire in 2022. Using their Q2 numbers (https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2) We can see that MAXN has an additional expense of $12M in Q2 because of above market polysilicon. This means that once the contract ends, they will immediately have $12M in savings, which is about 10% of their current revenue per quarter. Unfortunately, this $12M doesn't make them profitable, but it decreases their operating loss by almost 25%. It doesn't affect their P/S ratios, but it helps their EPS and cash flows, which could give them some runway.

Overall, I think MAXN is going to provide middling numbers and coupled with SPWR's lower results, the polysilicon offset won't be enough to pump MAXN beyond $25.",2021-11-16,12,20

lt3611_ENPH,ENPH,"ENPH: Jennifer Granhold just confirmed for energy, is solar+EV bull.","Alright, I'm back.

I don't like to repeat myself, but I think ENPH is an incredible buy range, and has been giving very easy swing plays. For further details, please see my previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpyjx7/enph\_from\_a\_10\_year\_solar\_veteran/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpyjx7/enph_from_a_10_year_solar_veteran/)

To the subject of this post: Jennifer Granhodl was **just** officially confirmed as director of Energy via ***a bipartisan vote***, and is incredibly bullish on both Solar and EV in particular. Renewables have taken a beating over the last few weeks due to the yeehawdis in Texas mistakenly blaming their deregulated grid failure on solar and wind, but it's incredibly important to note that solar production tracked by the Texas grid during the peak of Texas's nonsense more than **doubled**, while fossil fuel production collapsed.

I'm not a gambling man, and I might be an actual idiot; but I will be absolutely shocked if we don't see big news for solar in the near future, and if Enphase (one of the few highly profitable American companies with extreme market share) doesn't directly benefit. I'm not selling my ITM leaps below $300.

Recently Tesla had released **it's own converter which was primary a market controlled by SEDG and ENPH**:

[https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/](https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/)

In addition analysts have raised Teslas top price goal to be **above $1200**:

[https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697)

These two events mean that **TESLA is about to explode next week**. I suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split most likely and we will then see Tesla rise from $300 to just under $500 before the run actually ends. Although don't expect Tesla to reach $1000 again for at least another year after that.

While the gloves are hot, Diamond gloves makes it so you don't feel that you have to drop the burning TESLA cash. Do not trade them for paper gloves, for while you won't feel the heat as much the fire will burn that paper, and then you.

h7muk0_ENPH,ENPH,Enphase Energy - a sunny outlook,"Good morning,

Thanks for reading my post.  I've been in the investment industry over a little over a decade and from time to time I write research piece on single stocks and fund, as well as macro market. I'm quite new to Reddit and this is my first time posting in r/investing so looking forward to any comments and feedback you can share! 

I will start with my thoughts on renewable energy sector and one of the stocks in it which I have been following for sometime, [Enphase Energy](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENPH?p=ENPH).

**A bright renewable future**

Renewable energy has been growing at an exponential rate. Having already reached 25% of global electricity generation capacity back in 2018, renewable energy generating capacity is expected to grow further by an additional 50% through 2024 according to an analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects. Even faster growth would be possible if more favourable government policies and financial incentives can be put in place for renewable energy industry. In particular, the IEA also indicates the brightest future for solar technology as a major factor to support the growth of renewable energy, which is expected to account for 700 gigawatts (GW) of the 1,200 GW in anticipated new capacity additions through 2024.

More specific to the US, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, renewable is still expected to be America’s fastest growing source of electricity generator in 2020, according to the latest report by Solar Energy Industry Association. New solar installations in the US is expected to increase by 33% this year, as soaring demand by utilities for carbon-free power outweighs a dramatic decline in rooftop system orders for homes and businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The solar industry will install 18 gigawatts this year which would be sufficient for support more than 3 million homes’ electricity consumption.

**What does this mean for solar energy stocks?**

Admittedly It is an understatement that the stock market has seen a dramatic ride in 2020, with the bull market turning into a major bear market in record time, only for the reverse to happen in an equally shocking short time frame since the market bottomed in late March. Particularly, it is impossible to ignore that the energy sector thanks to the massive swing in oil prices caused by not only the pandemic but also the multilateral negotiation by the World’s major oil producers.

The issue that’s worth highlighting is that low oil and gas prices can be detrimental for the alternative energy sector such as solar. After all, what do price comparisons look like if the cost of oil and gas go so low that non-carbon based energy such as solar power become ever less competitive? Many of the tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy would become much less effective.

However, investing in solar stocks is typically a long term play as both consumers and investors are becoming more and more aware of the positive impact associated which ESG related energy solutions, of which solar technology would most definitely qualify. It’s worth looking at the companies that are involved in generating power from these clean energy sources. Their impressive earnings surprise history makes them worthy of addition to investors’ portfolio.

**One to watch: Enphase Energy**

[Enphase Energy](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENPH?p=ENPH) (NASDAQ:ENPH) is certainly one of alternative energy stocks that deserve investor’s attention. The company has revolutionized the solar technology through its pioneering product microinverter, which is an unique semiconductor-based system that converts the energy collected by solar panels into grid-compliant alternating current (AC) power, so that the solar-generated electricity can then be easily used for household and industrial consumption, and any surplus to be channelled on to the grid for other distribution purposes. Many electricity companies would pay for electricity power that’s injected into the grid from these sources, which in turn helps to reduce the utility bills for household and businesses who use this solar based energy solution.

Other key benefits of Enphase’s microinverter includes a simplified design to save space, and greater reliability and fire safety. In addition to microinverter, Enphase also produce other home energy solutions which can be tailor to the customer’s need whilst fully integrated on one smart platform.

Because of its high quality product and consistently strong operating margin over the past few years, shares of Enphase Energy saw a 600% raise from the start of 2019 into late summer, and after pulling back during the equity sell off earlier in March, it has gone up even higher up to reach $70 or so only a few weeks ago. Enphase is still expected to show revenue and earnings growth in over the coming years: its earnings growth is expected to be almost 40% from 2020 to 2021, on top of better than 40% sales growth from this year into next year, according to its latest quarterly release.

What also stands out for Enphase was that a number of investment banks have upgraded their outlook for Enphase despite the potential damaging impact of COVID-19 pandemic. On March 25, around the time when the US stock market reached the bottom, Barclays issued a new Overweight rating on Enphase and raised its target price to $67, whilst the stock was trading at $36 at the time. At the end of May JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating and raised its target to $67 from $54. Goldman Sachs appears to be less enthusiastic as they downgraded Enphase from Buy to Neutral, However they still raised its target to $57 from $50.

Why the bullishness? Enphase’s current dominance in microinverter is a key factor. For more than a decade later, Enphase is by far the world’s largest producer of microinverters, and a prominent player among investors focused on the renewable energy industry. Despite the technological and scale barriers, there are challenges from other companies also in the business, and new comers waiting to enter the field and play catch up as soon as one of the others demonstrates the ability to compete on the product design and pricing. In the competition for future market share, Enphase does has the advantage of size, experience, and reputation; but small companies can be nimble and flexible, whilst the larger ones have deeper pockets and will be willing to burn cash in the short term to catch up if they think large profits can be reaped in the future.

Regardless of who is left standing at the end, the resulting price cuts would ensure solar based energy solutions can be even more easily accessible to consumers and business who are becoming more and more aware of the environmental needs and benefit of using solar based energy, and more willing to contribute to the generational effort to rotate toward carbon-free energy to power a brighter and greener future.

gjc8lu_ENPH,ENPH,Solar energy will have explosive growth coming out of lockdown DD [ENPH $65 call 6/19],"Hello Autists. I predict that renewable energy, most notably solar will have an explosive growth in the next month and years. With the entire world on lockdown, we see pictures of once heavily polluted cities are now very clear and clear of smog. We have to accept that oil is becoming a commodity of the past and renewable energy will take over the future. This lockdown will be that catalyst for consumers to go green. Hydrogen powered vehicles, solar power energy, and self sustainable ways to harvest energy is becoming increasingly attractive in the media. 

==============================================================

Taken from a user on Stocktwits named WantedtoRetireEarly: 

Good comment from a solar installer: ""We've had to field more calls in the last month than I can remember in any April. We've made three sales with no contact with customers. It think the pandemic brings out the ""preper"" in people. Also, Tesla's solar tiles don't compete with anybody. They are a premium product and require special training to install. They also are integrated into the roof so maintenance and trouble-shooting is a bit more complicated. On that note Generac's inverter/battery offerings are a potential competition, but if you call them (I have numerous times) they don't have anyone who has information to give you on the technical aspects of an installation of their product line, specifically a retrofit for AC coupling of an existing PV installation. Finally, **Enphase's battery offing is whole house (up to 150 amps). SolarEdge's battery offering is only up to 25 amps per 7.6k inverter. I expect Enphase to overtake SE in the battery market when it becomes available.**""

Yesterday, an article was released **""Trump Administration Approves Largest U.S. Solar Project Ever""** 

U.S. Department of the Interior [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-approves-plan-largest-solar-project-us-history) this week the biggest solar project in the United States ever—an estimated US$1-billion solar plus battery storage project in Nevada. The project will consist of a 690-MW photovoltaic solar electric generating facility plus a battery storage facility. The project will be the world’s eighth-largest solar power facility and is expected to generate enough electricity to power 260,000 homes in the Las Vegas area and potential energy markets in Southern California, the Department of the Interior said. The Gemini project is expected to be built in two phases, with the first phase coming online in 2021 and final completion as early as 2022, the Department of the Interior said. The on-site construction workforce is expected to average 500 to 700 workers, with a peak of up to 900 workers, supporting up to an additional 1,100 jobs in the local community and injecting an estimated US$712.5 million into the economy in wages and total output during construction, the Interior said, at a time when [more than 20 million Americans](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Holds-Gains-Despite-Massive-Unemployment.html) have already lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said, commenting on the project’s approval:

“**The solar industry is resilient and a project like this one will bring jobs and private investment to the state when we need it most**. We appreciate the work that the Trump Administration has done to make this historic project a reality.”

“Gemini offers the **opportunity to showcase, at an unprecedented scale, what we believe to be one of the most promising technological advances in coupling battery storage to utility scale solar power to produce low cost renewable energy over the long term**,” [said](https://www.quinbrook.com/post/blm-doi-issue-final-record-of-decision-for-milestone-690mwgemini-solar-battery-storage-in-nevada) David Scaysbrook, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Quinbrook.

==============================================================

Technicals say that as long as the market remains bullish, we can expect ENPH to continue to rally in up to $69 target in the short term.

Barclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the firm's price target on Enphase Energy to **$80 from $76 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following the company's Q1 results**.

Europe - **doubled revenue over Q4. Tripled sales force.** Spain, Netherlands, Belgium Germany all exciting. Asia and Latin America are seeing revenue increases. Australia is seeing expansion but they expect a slow down in the region but they believe we are well positioned to do well in the long term.  


New products: Engineers have been working hard to implement remote debugging. Shelter in place did impact overall engineering and were unable to ship beta units at end of Q1. They are shipping now and expect to have revenue in Q2.  


IQ8 will be launched by Q4 and IQ8D for two panels is coming along well. Their solar panels will be **97.5% efficient.** Another big initiative: **Digital transformation**. Looking to develop a comprehensive digital platform for both homeowners and installers. When done right, it will serve as a **powerful catalyst to launch further sales. Expect to make significant progress in this area in 2020.** 

&#x200B;

ENPH has been experiencing explosive growth pre-coronavirus era going from a $2 stock in 2018 to $59.09 in March 2020 and now they rallied up to $65 just two days ago and is now sitting at $58. Their balance sheet is pretty healthy, and they're expecting to continue to increase their revenue. Their estimated EPS growth next year is 38.80% but I'm 100% sure its going to be way more. As per Finviz, their annual EPS Growth in the past years is **53.50%,** annual sales growth in the past 5 years **12.70%,** quarterly revenue growth is **105.10**, and quarterly earnings growth is **2393.20%.** ENPH was also recently added to the S&P midcap growth 400. I project this stock will skyrocket to $200 in the next 1-2 years and possibly >$300 within 5 years. Right now, I currently have 11 contracts for ENPH $65 C 6/19 since I'm playing on this currently rally, and will continue to add in increments for longer dated calls for a long term investment. SEDG and TAN are good stocks as well but I currently like ENPH for the growth.

This was my post some several months ago when ENPH had it's big ITC drop; needless to say, I bought the dip but without much capital at the time. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph\_could\_be\_your\_next\_success\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph_could_be_your_next_success_story/)

That being said, let's jump in on the DD.

This year should be a great year for energy/green stocks with the rapid shifting of tech companies towards fully electric and renewable energy sources (namely TSLA, Intel, MSFT, Google, Apple, etc - all of which use solar energy as part of their operations). Considering the growth of the solar industry in the last year as well as software-driven solar tech, the energy market is consistently finding new opportunities to increase exposure in the greater market and making meaningful partnerships. Take for example Sun Power, which is one of the largest distributors of solar panels in the U.S, Phillips which is working on a sustainable energy source for TSLA vehicles, PLUG which is making deals with Amazon, Walmart, and potentially Home Depot. In fact, the U.S in 2019 has increased this sector's employment by 250,000 jobs in just Florida alone, and an increase in 31 states. Employment rate is oftentimes  a great predictor for an industry's health and outlook. Moreover, legislation such as CA Title 24 mandate requires all homes built after 2020 to have solar PV installed, and prior to this, following Lennar, Toll Brothers, and KBH, every new property developed in the last 2 years have solar installed and software-solar tech (automated thermostats). Another thing to consider is the cutting of door-to-door sales in many solar tech companies, and focusing on consultants that build partnerships for these companies. Vehicles are also starting to move into solar tech, with TSLA being the obvious front runner, but also fully electric Jaguars, MUSTANGS, and Audi's, all of which have never produced any fully electric, or even hybrid vehicles up until the recent years. The demand for solar is high and traditional energy providers (fossil fuels and standard energy providers) are starting to lose marketshare in the energy sector. This is mainly as a result of the growing issues and litigations over high winds, faulty equipment, and fires. If you take a look at solar installations, you will see a clear trend:

&#x200B;

Starts with ITC incentives have been very favorable towards these solar companies, and with the tiered tax credit incentive system that depreciates each year, people are incentivized to get this tech sooner than later. What the ITC means (for those that don't know), it's the investment tax credit which is a 26% federal tax deduction for installing solar tech in your home. And as the full electric auto market grows, there is a substantially larger percentage of residents that will have these installed. For those buying new homes this year and forward, they will come fully furnished. 

There are lots of catalyst in this space, everything from the automotive industry, real estate industry, software tech industry, ITC, and general move towards renewable energy. Cloud based platforms will require an immense amount of energy to run these cloud servers, and MSFT/Amazon are already all over solar tech. This area is also just starting to develop rapidly. 

My picks are, from most optimistic to least:

VSLR, RUN, SPWR, ENPH, SEDG 

Also, for those that are discussing FSLR, it was a huge miss but imo analyst had no reason to lift EPS this high and guidance last quarter was far too optimistic. One big reason why I believe FSLR failed is that they are the only utility-scale distributor in the mix. That means they only work with utility companies to provide energy on large grids, however, they do not fit into the category or have partnerships with commercial or residential units. Moreover, as utility companies are beginning to lose marketshare and are losing the trust of customers (especially in CA), I can only imagine that FLSR partnerships are suffering. Anyway, I lost money on my calls which will probably be at -90% at open. I thought it would ride the energy wave, but I was wrong.

Let's get down to the numbers. Earnings Beat 0.29 Actual vs 0.25 Expected. Last year, EPS was 0.04. Their guidance was maintained and also upgraded with its expansion into other investments.

Company convert 10.7% of it's revenue into net income, which is far better than the net losses reported in the previous year. Revenue in the first 9 months is an all time high and projected grow as their financial management team is doing gods work to position them into more diverse investments to capture growth. 

The company is making efforts to expand their inventory by 50% to meet the increased demand, always good to be prepared for possibilities of shortages, and the sector as a whole is also regaining it's grip of the market. Energy sector for this year has been below the SP500 average growth, but with ENPH's customer base, they are capturing enough clientele to go positive. 

Cashflow is positive, est. 200M and reserved 38M for operating cash flow. Looks to me like this company is well positioned for more growth in the coming years as the technology and high performance electronics sector will inevitably appreciate and solar technology will definitely follow suit.

SO, why the 25% drop? Well, the main concern is the 30% ITC (investment tax credit) for solar energy projects which is expected to eat into revenue, but this rate slopes off with time. Expected to drop to 26% by 2020, 21% in 2021, and 20% in 2022. This will not interfere with customer side of things or growth as this is a company expense. 

ENPH was truly an underdog that I overlooked in the past when it was sub $10. Really wish I had gotten in early to capture to underlying growth trends, but now that it has dropped 25% in what I believe to be an overreaction, it's a good buy opporunity.

Option prices for calls are CHEAP. Jan 2020 of Jan 2021 if you're feeling good about holding far out. Personally, 17.50/20 strikes for Jan 2020 are appealing and worth the risk. The company is known to have consecutive 5% jumps on the daily.

Market is down, ENPH is cheap right now. My \^ position is still in it even after it went down to $22.

From a previous post of mine:  

Little synopsis: Enphase Energy makes microinverters for solar panels that other companies install. Their microinverters create a decentralized power source such that if a solar panel is malfunctioning, the rest of the panels will continue to produce solar energy. This is in contrast to centralized systems where if one panel is down, the whole system gets wonky.

Looking at ENPH’s financials, they are now net positive in profits and have increased in value significantly. This company is invisible to the average investor because the way this company operates is very intricate and not well known.",2019-09-20,13,11

a71yir_ENPH,ENPH,Thoughts on Enphase Energy?,"I was digging around for some small price stocks that would be a good purchase for long term, and I stumbled across enphase energy or ENPH. Not 100% sure on what exactly their technology does, but it seems like it has something to do with converting your house to be able to run on solar power. 

Looking at earnings reports, most seem to be right on the dot to where they were estimated, with a gradual rise in the past two years. 

In mid 2015 their stock seems to fall (despite them being considered the “best” in the industry at the time). from what I could find online this seems to be because most people think there is not any growth to come from enphase, and that they have kinda already capped out.

In early 2018 their stock is on the rise again, but I cant seem to figure out why.

Anyway, Im thinking about investing despite of what people are saying about them. I think there is still room for growth in the industry.

 inverters for solar equipment. Big thing that just was released that the new national building code that will be adopted by next year is putting a new regulation that all energy equipment is required to install these micro-inverters for all installation. This company being one of the biggest out there on a national scale, will see a huge revenue expansion within in the next year or so, and I just saw that there stock price is pretty low, thought I'd share to you guys.
