1dq1vio_FCX,FCX,DD FCX,"Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

**Executive Summary**
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.

**1. Growing Demand for Copper**

A. Technology Sector and AI Boom

- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.
- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.

B. Renewable Energy and Electrification

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.
- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.

**2. Strong Production Capabilities**

A. Diversified Asset Portfolio

- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.
- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.

B. Production Expansion Plans

- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.

 **3. Favorable Market Conditions**

A. Copper Price Trends

- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.

B. Supply Constraints

- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX’s commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.

**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**

A. Strong Financial Position:

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.
- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.

B. Shareholder Returns

- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.
- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.


**Conclusion**
Investing in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX’s strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.


TLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.

Added benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.

1cgavsn_FCX,FCX,FCX Watch,"Just a note on FCX from some chart study today. Obvious it's hitting all time highs. What's different are a few signs of a major technical breakout in stock price.

Start of 2022 FCX topped out at 51.99, after a heavy volume run up from $10, then retreated to about 28 over a few months. For past year+, it's been in 33 to 43 range bound, signaling long consolidation, til it started moving up in March as copper rose.

First key point: As price neared 50 a month ago, and for the 3 weeks prior to last week, we see a 3 weeks tight pattern in relatively high volume, as FCX tried to break out from that early 2022 high. Super consolidation.

Second point: last week it looks like a cup formed. Today FCX broke out with large gain on good volume. So I see a 2 year cup with handle pattern with a breakout attempt today.

After seeing many charts, this is most unusual to me: a 3 week tight pattern followed right away by a long term cup with handle pattern.

Volume for past month is higher than average over prior months.

Worth watching the next few days. 

Buy point would be $52.09 based on 2 year old high. Hard to set proper buy point based on the handle cuz 3 weeks tight throws noise into daily price ranges. So to make it simple, the time is Now 😁 52.41 at April 29 close. ",2024-04-29,5,6

[https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/](https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/)

Copper prices rose on 8th Feb as optimism around a US stimulus raised hopes of higher demand for metals and a recovery in the world’s biggest economy.

The copper price rose as much as 1.3% to $3.6745 ($8,100 a tonne) on the Comex market on Monday, with March delivery contracts back within shouting distance of multi-year highs hit early in January.

The metal has rallied nearly 90% since the depth of the pandemic in March.

Thinning inventories

The rise in copper prices is underpinned by thinning inventories that pointed to higher demand for the industrial metal.

“Inventories are still quite low on exchanges. That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,” Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)

In China, the world’s top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.

But this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.

Meanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).

In Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country’s Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).

Copper miners gain

Despite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world’s top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.

**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.

Copper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. 

Green initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate plan, and China’s target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. 

Although mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.

Take [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  

The big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.

[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)

Many thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.

**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines**

Global copper demand

As mentioned above, it’s not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.

In the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.

My main point was that FCX, the worlds biggest copper miner, completely deviated from the index and that it was going to spring back to match it. **It did, and popped 20%.**


Due to the market chaos this week the same exact set up is there again.

For reference use this

FCX peaked on 2/22 at 38.99 and is down 5% since then while copper is up 2.4%.


We are looking at a 7% swing here, and copper is looking so bullish its actually insane. We are most likely gonna hit all time highs at this rate. Every day will start red and end up green bigly. If copper has a big day this week then an even bigger pop is gauranteed.

* For whatever its worth, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/).

**I. Introduction**

* The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*

* If you’ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China’s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years. 

* I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.

**II. Coronavirus & Government Intervention**

* The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies – **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** – to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration. 

* The impact wasn’t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers – expecting lower demand – [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension. 

* Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).

**III. Industrial Demand**

* Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government’s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.

* For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil & Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets. Renewable investments have been highly profitable with [studies stating](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/05/28/just-how-good-an-investment-is-renewable-energy-new-study-reveals-all/?sh=7b9d17194d27) that renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments. [The International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/financeinvestment/Investment-Needs#:~:text=In%20its%20latest%20analysis%2C%20Global,in%20the%202016%2D2050%20period) stated the world would require an additional $27T in infrastructure spending from 2016-2050 fulfill the objects of the Paris Agreement. Annual renewable investments in 2018 would have needed to [double](https://i.imgur.com/aKqAwSh.png) to be on track to meet targets and **[Goldman Sachs believes that the capital expenditure cycle could rival the 2000s](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM).** 

* China has announced they expect [higher steel demand](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-steel-idUSL1N2K204Z) vs last year. [Economists now see US-China GDP parity in 2028 from 2033](https://i.imgur.com/OOkc7mO.png). Both the US and China are looking to upset one another and it’s hard to see demand slacking with [two world powers competing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245) to achieve faster greenification and out-GDP the other. Note that [India](https://i.imgur.com/coaL6YG.png) joined the infrastructure bandwagon last year and continued to emphasize infrastructure in their [latest budget](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/india-budget-health-care-infrastructure-and-fiscal-deficit.html). Countries have begun to launch major projects to meet their targets or as a tool to generate economic activity. [South Korea](https://www.power-technology.com/news/south-korea-plans-build-43bn-offshore-wind-farm/). [Scotland](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d4355db2-3036-4450-b2a0-611a56d944bf). [EU](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568). [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-transit-fund-1.5908346). [Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).

* Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward. [These guys will probably need more metals too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market).

* Global construction is looking at a [record growth](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2021/02/global-market-scan-2021-a-year-of-recovery-and-reacceleration-in-global-construction) for the year. Additionally, expanding the sector is a way for governments to have an immediate effect on [employment](https://i.imgur.com/JnbiYUS.png) and thus the economy. [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/infrastructure-stimulus-in-covid-pandemic-recovery-and-beyond)

* Lastly, the most recent [ISM](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202102pmi.pdf) manufacturing index has continued to point towards growth with low inventory, high backlog, and overall bullish outlook on economic activity.  [Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png) 

**IV. Financial Demand**

* The government’s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.

* Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.

* PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html) 

**V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines** 

* The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges. 

* All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government’s upcoming spending agenda. The markets – on near zero interest rates – are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).

* Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining’s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.

**VI. Conclusion**

* The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.

* Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden’s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.

lhz1ej_GD,GD,"FCX dd-Copper is in a breakout from recent highs and someone looks to be manipulating the worlds biggest copper miner(FCX)downward to scoop up shares on the cheap on the heels of the upcoming bull run, plus more DD","Ok guys, this seems like its gonna be pretty big. Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.

[Heres someone way smarter than this retard confirming my beliefs.](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/fx_technical_weekly/2021/02/10/copper-price-outlook-bullish-as-breakout-begins.html)

The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost 3.59% which for copper is pretty fucking big. 

Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.

**AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED 2.74 MILLION SHARES**

[Order book screenshot](https://ibb.co/tMKDwGD)

2.74M shares, 85 Million dollars worth.

While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at -2.5% on a day where copper was +1.5%. Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another 1.5%, and today again where copper ended up +.2% and FCX was for some reason down again at -.8%. Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.

The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up 2.8% since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down 3.2%. That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.

I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with looming inflation and a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.

Beyond that, this was also put up by yahoo today.

6zoyeo_FCX,FCX,Insider Buying at Freeport McMoRan,"Freeport McMoRan's (FCX) COO Harry Conger bought over $550,000 of stock last Thurday at $15.23 (SP currently $14.31 as I type).  Effectively doubling his holding.  

The company has benefitted fom recent rises in copper prices, so much so that the Indonesian govt began to become edgy about how much the company was making out of the Grasberg mine.  So much so that it had stopped exports in January saying it wanted greater local ownership and more royalties.  

To resolve the issue an agreement was reached at the end of August that will allow Indonesia to take a 51% stake in the mine but will pay a fair market value for it.  Not ideal but it means the government will now have an incentive to ensure the smooth operation of the mine and will result in a very useful sum of cash sum for FCX.

All this helps clean up alot of uncertainty regarding operations that should lead to a brighter future - the CFO seems to think so.

4a5q37_FCX,FCX,$FCX - What would you do?,"I know I don't have much of this, and I know it's not a lot of money (I add to my portfolio on each paycheck) but I'm not sure whether to hold or sell, so I'm looking for some opinions. I've only been dealing with stocks since January, but I've already made (IMO) a couple good trades and haven't had a loss ... yet :)

So, I bought into $FCX at $3.83 (my first trade so only 4 shares because I didn't know what I was doing at all), then I bought another 16 shares at $7.15, and finally another 10 shares at $8.95 - I just had a good feeling about this company and own some physical PMs so I liked mining companies and bought into a few and a couple ETFs.

Anyway, I now have 30 shares of $FCX at a cost basis of $8.16 (including Fidelity's fees). The closing price Friday was $9.55 - I'm up 16.95% (+$41.53).

I was just reading this article on Seeking Alpha and it got me thinking - should I hold or should I take the gains and get out - or should I buy some more shares?

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3957956-move-freeport-mcmoran?app=1&auth_param=1bc52i:1be8jqs:83aaf75e5c92920d83f85d18d3fb8c67&uprof=45&dr=1#alt1

I would appreciate any opinions on this, I know they still have a lot of debt, the price of copper is really low, etc., etc., but like I said - I just had a really good gut feeling about this company and after looking into it I bought.

So should I stay or should I go? :)

Thanks!

That coupled with their recent oil acquisition and China's increased manufacturing numbers coming in, I think there is a lot of upside here and in the non-precious metals industry.

So why is it that all I hear is how this sector is hurting and probably hasn't hit bottom? Do these disclaimers affect the junior with massive capital outlays, or do analysts really not see copper, molybdenum, etc. prices coming back?",2013-08-28,1,2
