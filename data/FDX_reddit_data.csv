# Nike's Earnings Reveal — CEO Hill's Plan to Fix the Swoosh

Nike CEO Elliott Hill has laced up and hit the ground running. Tasked with undoing years of overproduction and poor strategy, Hill is steering the world’s largest sportswear brand back toward its sporty roots—but don’t expect quick wins.

**Hitting Reset**  
  
Hill’s strategy is clear: scale back on mass-market shoes like Dunks and Air Force 1s, which have lost their cachet, and refocus on performance sports gear. That shift comes with a cost. Last quarter, revenue fell 8% to $12.35 billion, while profits dropped to $1.16 billion. Expect an even steeper decline next quarter as Nike clears excess inventory to restore some exclusivity.

The goal? Create more demand than supply—a classic Nike move that hasn’t been executed well lately.

**Mending Fences**  
  
Wholesale partners like Foot Locker and JD Sports are finally getting some love after being sidelined by Hill’s predecessor. Foot Locker is already expanding its Nike-backed Home Court sections globally, signaling a fresh start in rebuilding trust. But the hard work isn’t over. Wholesale revenue was still down 3% last quarter, reflecting the uphill climb.  
  
Nike’s international scoreboard isn’t exactly lighting up. China revenue slumped 8% to $1.71 billion, North America fell 8% to $5.18 billion, and even Converse tripped with a 17% decline. But there’s a silver lining: gross margins held at 43.6%, slightly better than expected, thanks to tighter control over markdowns.

**A Few Wins in the Playbook**  
  
Nike scored major points off the field, locking in its NFL uniform deal through 2038—cementing its partnerships with the NFL, NBA, and MLB. These wins showcase Nike’s dominance in sports, even as its market share in sneakers takes a hit from competitors like On Running and Hoka.

Nike’s stock has slipped 27% this year, but Hill’s pivot to performance and tighter inventory controls could breathe new life into the brand. For now, though, it’s a waiting game—because turning around a giant takes time.

# FedEx Divides and Conquers with $30B Freight Spinoff

FedEx is making big moves, spinning off its freight division into a standalone public company. The freight unit—valued at over $30 billion—will fly solo within 18 months, setting the stage for FedEx to double down on its core package delivery business. Investors were thrilled, sending shares up 10% in after-hours trading.

**Breaking Down the Breakup**

FedEx Freight, the heavyweight of U.S. less-than-truckload shipping, pulls in $9.4 billion annually by hauling shipments for multiple customers on shared trucks. Spinning it off doesn’t just streamline FedEx’s structure—it could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value. Analysts are buzzing that Freight's independence could mirror the stock surges seen by rivals like Old Dominion Freight Line.

CEO Raj Subramaniam is all about focus, calling the move a chance for each company to sharpen its competitive edge. And while Freight gets a clean slate, FedEx plans to use this moment to rethink its package delivery strategy, merging its Express and Ground units.

**Clouds on the Horizon**

Of course, not everything’s rosy. FedEx reported a 1% dip in revenue and an 18% profit slide for the second quarter, thanks to weaker package demand and sluggish freight activity. Oh, and it trimmed its full-year earnings outlook to $19-$20 per share, down from $20-$21. Blame the economy, the loss of a key U.S. Postal Service contract, and customers opting for cheaper, slower delivery options.

Still, investors and analysts are hopeful. The spinoff could give FedEx the focus it needs to fix its package game, while Freight gets a chance to thrive on its own. It’s a bold move, and all eyes are on FedEx to deliver.

Tomorrow’s big-ticket economic drop: the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, aka the Fed’s inflation crystal ball. It’s the last major data point of 2024 before the markets swap trading floors for holiday cheer. The spotlight is on Core PCE, which ditches food and energy volatility to focus on the stickier parts of inflation.

Last month, PCE rose 2.3% year-over-year, while Core PCE climbed 2.8%—exactly as economists called it. This time, forecasts peg overall PCE at 2.5% and Core at 2.9%. A cooler-than-expected report might mean a drama-free finish to the year, but if inflation overshoots, you’ll see Wall Street traders sweating through their eggnog.

1fts0m0_FDX,FDX,My thoughts on FDX during the port strikes,"FedEx (FDX) is likely to benefit from the recent port strike for several reasons.

1.	Diversion of Cargo: During port strikes, cargo that would typically move through seaports may be delayed or disrupted. Businesses looking for reliable alternatives will likely turn to air freight or other logistics solutions (more on alternative solutions in reason 2) to avoid the bottleneck at the ports. FedEx, being a major player in air and ground transportation, is well-positioned to absorb some of this rerouted volume.	

2.	Alternative Transport Routes: As ocean shipping faces challenges due to the strike, businesses may explore alternative methods for shipping goods, such as through trucking or rail, both of which FedEx offers through its Freight and Ground divisions. This can drive additional business to the company. 

3.	Enhanced Competitive Positioning: As some of FedEx’s competitors, such as ocean freight carriers or other logistics companies dependent on ports, may struggle to maintain normal operations, FedEx has an opportunity to strengthen its competitive position. This could lead to increased market share in logistics and supply chain solutions.

# Nike Shakes It Up — CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who’s stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe’s last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

# Nike Shakes It Up — CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who’s stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe’s last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

1fh1cfl_FDX,FDX,"Prognosis ER , freight me FDX down below , see chart","FedEx is set to report its earnings for Q3 2024 on September 19th, following the market close. The current consensus for earnings per share (EPS) is projected at $4.87, with expected revenue reaching approximately $21.93 billion. As always, market participants will be closely watching the company's guidance to better gauge future performance, as clarity here will be essential for setting expectations moving forward.

While I don't possess the ability to predict outcomes with certainty, I can offer insights based on a technical analysis of the chart.

For instance, consider the price action on December 19, 2023, a Tuesday, when FedEx stock reached a high of $285. Despite the initial upward momentum, the market found no acceptance at that price level, leading to a breakdown following the earnings report. Similarly, on March 22, 2024 (Friday), the stock surged upward, once again testing the $285-$289 range. However, as the auction process failed to establish sustained acceptance at this level, the price declined shortly afterward.

Most notably, the earnings report on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, left a significant gap on the chart. According to technical principles such as gap theory, it’s likely that the price action in upcoming sessions will aim to retest the lower levels and potentially fill the gap that was created.",2024-09-15,22,24

1dould7_FDX,FDX,FedEx shares jump after hours as massive cost-cutting measures kick in ,"FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts’ estimates in both earnings and revenue.

Here’s how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company’s earnings call.

“We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,” Carere said. “We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

“DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year ’24,” CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company’s plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company’s Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor’s eyes are also on the company’s largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment’s margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a “top priority” for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx’s contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company’s Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.

For earnings this week there really isn’t much going on except the one stock most people on here joined because of. And there are some other good plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I’m bullish on but options are very expensive.

So this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up. Secondly MKC own Franks Red Hot and I really love franks red hot so it will go up.

18p1w5j_KO,KO,FedEx Looks Like A Bargain Now,"I spent some of this year feeling like I missed out on FedEx as it climbed 41% up to what I thought was outside my margin of safety to open a position. I did have FedEx coming in on a screener at the beginning of 2023 but eliminated it in favor of another stock. 

Well, it just so happens that I am eliminating KO due to it's price not correlating with intrinsic value well this year (a huge red flag for me) and I will be replacing them with FDX going into 2024. 

When I look at FDX, I see a company with a very reliable dividend that is less than KO (therefore reducing my taxable income burden per annum), I see a company that grew earnings substantially over the TTM and isn't going to stop growing earnings during a period I expect a lot of earnings pain in the ""most favored names.""

2024 has a high likelihood in my opinion to really punish some of this risk on rally in low quality stocks with a round of very disappointing earnings. You can't have poor fundamentals perform well forever. FDX is, at least, upper medium grade financials with a substantial price drop. The price also correlates exceptionally well over time with the intrinsic value (a strong mark in their favor for me). I think any value investor has to consider FDX here with objectivity. This tends to be the essence of value investing - buying stocks that fall out of favor quickly and for misguided reasons - which is the circumstance here through my eyes.",2023-12-23,30,49

* **KB Home (KBH)** Expected Move: **5.27%**

FedEx reports after the close. Options are pricing in about a 4.4% move. Recent earnings have seen the stock move -3%, +4%, +3% and -3%. So the expected move today is on the high side of the past 4 but the stock has been remarkably consistent in moves on earnings over the past year.

The stock has been calm into the print, with realized vol (how much the stock has actually moved) over the past 30 days just 16. That compares to option vol this week of 82, and 30-day IV of 32. In general, the stock has been less volatile in real life than options have been pricing. For reference, the realized vol over the past year is about 27.

On the economic news front a slew of interest rate decisions and global CPI and PMI reports. The FOMC announces Wednesday. The market is all but certain (99%) the Fed stays put this month but the focus will be on any hawkish language in the statement. SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at about 14 IV. That IV drops the next week to 12, so options markets are trying to price a bit of volatility for this week, however, it's from a very low level of overall option prices.

IV is historically low across the board but this past Friday's expiration saw a significant amount of option premium expire. Traders will be keeping an eye on whether there was a shift in the vol regime following that expiry. It is possible that the gamma in the market into this past Friday's expiry had a dampening effect on moves. Whether traders become option buyers or remain rolling sellers is yet to be seen. Keep an eye on both 0DTE/Weekly IV as well as the VIX to get a sense of which way that bias is trending.

14eaj6s_FDX,FDX,"Expected moves this week: SPY, FedEx, Carmax and more","Stock futures are slightly lower this morning, following Friday's slight pullback. Despite Friday's selling SPY finished up 2.2% last week, continuing a strong June that has already seen SPY higher by more than 5%. It's been a pretty textbook Summer grind higher thus far, with very low IV and tight intra-week ranges. As mentioned before, a slow grind higher usually results in low IV, but at the same time, low IV helps set up the conditions for a slow grind, as long gamma in the market prevents the market from rocketing to the upside, and on sell-offs there are usually buyers waiting below. For the market to break from that trend usually takes some sort of fear or FOMO that turns options sellers into buyers, freeing the market up from long gamma and allowing larger moves. Options aren't anticipating that those conditions change anytime soon, with SPY IV just 11 for this week. The expected move for SPY for the week is around 1%.

The biggest thing happening on the economic front this week is Fed Chairman Powell's congressional testimony on Wednesday (during market hours). On the earnings front, we hear from FedEx today, and Carmax on Friday. Options are pricing about a 5% move in FedEx today.

14eaj6s_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves this week: SPY, FedEx, Carmax and more","Stock futures are slightly lower this morning, following Friday's slight pullback. Despite Friday's selling SPY finished up 2.2% last week, continuing a strong June that has already seen SPY higher by more than 5%. It's been a pretty textbook Summer grind higher thus far, with very low IV and tight intra-week ranges. As mentioned before, a slow grind higher usually results in low IV, but at the same time, low IV helps set up the conditions for a slow grind, as long gamma in the market prevents the market from rocketing to the upside, and on sell-offs there are usually buyers waiting below. For the market to break from that trend usually takes some sort of fear or FOMO that turns options sellers into buyers, freeing the market up from long gamma and allowing larger moves. Options aren't anticipating that those conditions change anytime soon, with SPY IV just 11 for this week. The expected move for SPY for the week is around 1%.

The biggest thing happening on the economic front this week is Fed Chairman Powell's congressional testimony on Wednesday (during market hours). On the earnings front, we hear from FedEx today, and Carmax on Friday. Options are pricing about a 5% move in FedEx today.

Amazon also launched free shipping software for sellers, and discounted shipping rates. Amazon has piled money into its logistics capability over the past few years, to the point it has excess capacity for its own needs and is hungry for more share which is being targeted through FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) and could be weighing on FedEx. I’d be buying Amazon on weakness here.""

11oumb5_DG,DG,"Expected moves: SPY, XLF, KRE, TLT, and Earnings from Adobe and FedEx","## Market View

**Last Week – A bad week that somehow got worse**.

The week started off weak for stocks with rising treasury yields and fears of a more aggressive Fed, and got worse on Friday with a bank failure. SPY was lower by 4.5%, a move way beyond what options were pricing. Option vol spiked with the sell-off, with the VIX closing the week near 25, up from 18.50.

**This Week – Eyes on banks, treasury yields, a CPI and the Fed reaction to turmoil.**

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, much higher than last week’s 1.6%. IV now the highest it’s been in 2023. The last time the VIX was 25 was in December of 2022. To say this is a critical week for markets on the macro front would be an understatement. Options were already looking forward to an important CPI report for signs of the Fed’s next moves, but a banking failure last week, largely a result of aggressive Fed moves, throws some chaos into the FOMC guessing game.

Friday’s equity sell-off came alongside a sharp decline in short-term treasury yields, moves that would typically have been in opposite directions over the past 6 months. But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank runs the risk of a flight to safety in short-term treasuries, as well as the potential for more bank runs. The Fed will have to weigh the risks that more rate hikes will have in this new environment, or decide that the inflation fight is more important than other banks that may also be sitting on low-interest rate portfolios. The bond market reaction this week will be one to watch, especially after this week’s CPI. A cool print could give the Fed some breathing room to chill out and maybe even pause soon. A hot print and it’s anyone’s guess what happens next.

Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.5% expected move, about $376 on the downside and $396 on the upside. $376 would match the lows going back to December 28th, 2022, and would mean new lows for 2023:

**Last Week – A bad week that somehow got worse**.

The week started off weak for stocks with rising treasury yields and fears of a more aggressive Fed, and got worse on Friday with a bank failure. SPY was lower by 4.5%, a move way beyond what options were pricing. Option vol spiked with the sell-off, with the VIX closing the week near 25, up from 18.50.

**This Week – Eyes on banks, treasury yields, a CPI and the Fed reaction to turmoil.**

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, much higher than last week’s 1.6%. IV now the highest it’s been in 2023. The last time the VIX was 25 was in December of 2022. To say this is a critical week for markets on the macro front would be an understatement. Options were already looking forward to an important CPI report for signs of the Fed’s next moves, but a banking failure last week, largely a result of aggressive Fed moves, throws some chaos into the FOMC guessing game.

Friday’s equity sell-off came alongside a sharp decline in short-term treasury yields, moves that would typically have been in opposite directions over the past 6 months. But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank runs the risk of a flight to safety in short-term treasuries, as well as the potential for more bank runs. The Fed will have to weigh the risks that more rate hikes will have in this new environment, or decide that the inflation fight is more important than other banks that may also be sitting on low-interest rate portfolios. The bond market reaction this week will be one to watch, especially after this week’s CPI. A cool print could give the Fed some breathing room to chill out and maybe even pause soon. A hot print and it’s anyone’s guess what happens next.

Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.5% expected move, about $376 on the downside and $396 on the upside. $376 would match the lows going back to December 28th, 2022, and would mean new lows for 2023:

Pretty sure they started it today after the close in a big way. Over 6 million shares have traded after the close, all in huge blocks for $159.12. Todays intraday volume was only about 4 million. I would expect to see institutional ownership continue to increase on this news. Given the current climate and fedex giving a strong dividend, I think this is a solid recession play.

xl6b4p_FDX,FDX,FDX Pre-Release Trade,"In this post, I wanted to share my trade on FDX after the firm pre-released its quarterly earnings. I talked about my thought process, what led me to sell FDX volatility the day of the pre-release, and why I thought the trade was a profitable one. I start with the context of the trade, share what I saw in the data as I was analysing this opportunity, and tell you how I structured this trade. 

# Context

It’s September 16. FDX just pre-released earnings, and the stock was down BAD.  We saw a move downwards of about 22%. As expected, implied volatility was up big as well. At the highest point, 30-day implied volatility was up nearly 10% intraday.

https://preview.redd.it/0bn9pm3cnfp91.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eaa0687bba1cff9236c4d809686cdbfbe8510b6

# What do we know?

The pre-release shouldn’t affect future volatility too much; aside from some PEAD. The pre-release should have quickly been priced in; other than earnings, nothing changed about the company, so there's no reason for longer-term volatility to change.  Volatility should probably return to previous levels. By eyeballing the graph, it looks like FDX should stay at 32% ish at most. Implied volatility (even after accounting for the upcoming earnings announcement) was pretty high.

While IV was 45, this is partly because of FDX’s upcoming earnings announcement. However, we can see that even after accounting for earnings, our Non-Event IV is elevated. NE-IV (IV adjusted for upcoming earnings) seems overpriced.

https://preview.redd.it/ccg1avvenfp91.png?width=1563&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c63ee46315424446b61d8461199e17b1d29cb01

Even though IV should keep going up because of the upcoming earnings,  we’ll make a bunch just being short gamma.

For reference, the implied earnings move was pretty high too; over the last few years, FDX's implied earnings move doesn't get much larger than 7%. Because of this, I didn’t expect vols to run up too much, especially since the markets should be pricing in a smaller move than usual now that some results have been pre-released. I didn’t know if the implied move was going to be less than 6%, but judging from historical implied moves,  it’s likely that it wouldn't be more.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/scflxazgnfp91.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=d770a035b45ad4b8d40182ef3ec5f22b0f650ca6

Aside from seeing elevated implied volatility, I recalled a research paper I read not too long ago: after an earnings event, major moves after earnings announcements cause traders to overestimate volatility. Even though the research paper wasn’t specifically about pre-releases, the logic should still apply.

All things considered, it seemed like selling vol on FDX would be a profitable trade. 

# The Trade

I started selling Sept 23 straddles at about 66 Vol. I could’ve sold the Octobers that were about 30DTE, but I figured I would have the most exposure to the mispriced volatility (the week or so after pre-release) by selling the short-dated stuff. 

Trade management wasn’t anything particularly complicated, just delta hedging so that I would stay neutral in terms of market direction. 

https://preview.redd.it/8u33rleynfp91.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a035fba456400a4d1fdd10806198659f40b4ecf

While realized volatility (RV) went up a ton in the graph, that was only because of the volatility during the pre-release. By the time I sold my straddles, the stock had calmed down. Over the next few days, I collected a ton of theta without losing too much when delta hedging. Non-event implied volatility had fallen to about 30ish by Monday, so my profit had come in - we were at my target vol. I considered holding to expiration since being short vol over earnings tends to make money, but implied volatility started to rise on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I paperhanded. 

If you were short October vol, you would’ve sold at 45-46 vol and got out at 41, winning on vega and gamma. I got out of the Sept 23 straddle at nearly the same vol that I got in - but I collected a ton of time decay. My net profit was about $375 per straddle, maybe $10,000 in margin each. Not too bad for a 5-day trade.

I've heard stories from the aircraft mechanics who work on commercial passenger and freight planes. The cost of flying and maintaining these has gone way up, good mechanics are 1 in a thousand, and the global supply chain is still FUBAR on top of that.

xfpyrn_FDX,FDX,FedEx CEO says he expects the economy to enter a ‘worldwide recession’,"FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam told CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Thursday that he believes a recession is impending for the global economy.

“I think so. But you know, these numbers, they don’t portend very well,” Subramaniam said in response to Cramer’s question of whether the economy is “going into a worldwide recession.”

The CEO’s pessimism came after FedEx missed estimates on revenue and earnings in its first quarter. The company also withdrew its full year guidance.

Shares of FedEx fell 15% in extended trading on Thursday.

“I’m very disappointed in the results that we just announced here, and you know, the headline really is the macro situation that we’re facing,” Subramaniam said in an interview on “Mad Money.”

The chief executive, who assumed the position earlier this year, said that weakening global shipment volumes drove FedEx’s disappointing results. While the company anticipated demand to increase after factories shuttered in China due to Covid opened back up, it actually fell, he said.

That said, if we look at sales for some names on their latest quarter on a q/q basis, you'd see EBAY (2.5%), HAS +15.1%, and WMT +8%. Sales have not exactly been collapsing here. If sales are okay, how can there be such a drop in package volume?

tjuvdu_FDX,FDX,Fed up with losing? Buy FedEx ($FDX)!!!,"I have recently taken a look at FDX stock now that its earnings is behind it and IV has come down a little. I am actually liking the current chart set up quite a bit. First of all, see in the chart below, it is approaching a resistance which has stood since the start of the year. Though the stock has not quite broke through the resistance yet, I do believe that it has the strength to do so based on the current set up and most recent ER. FDX is currently on a short term uptrend on high volume from a pretty good earnings. FDX missed on EPS by a little over a percent but crushed on revenue earning nearly 200 million more than what was expected by analysts. The overall sentiment for the ER can be summed up by how quickly the stock recovered after initially dumping on ER. Additionally, on the 4 hr chart, the MACD is still pointing towards further appreciation and the RSI has not yet reached the overbought portion of its range.

[4hr chart for FDX](https://preview.redd.it/208vvden2vo81.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d35507e580b482b258bf994a1529531f7c3d0ea)

Looking at the chart on a much smaller timeframe (30min), FDX is actually forming a wedge. On this timeframe, MACD also is pointing towards price appreciation and RSI is not yet overbought. the pattern resembles an inverse head an shoulders which is bullish and could breakout in the next couple days.

Once again, this is just my opinion on the stock and how I think itll move in the next couple days, there are many other ways to interpret the chart.

Thanks and good luck to all this trading week.

**In the News**

Last week, we highlighted the extreme implied vol in energy and commodity-related names. USO, the United States Oil fund, was pricing about a 9% move for the week. It essentially made that move before the week even started as oil futures spiked Sunday and USO was up 8-9% pre-market on Monday. It reversed and by the end of the week actually finished lower, by about 4% on the week. Implied volatility in the space also contracted slightly, with USO options pricing in about a 7% move this week vs the 9% last week. USO IV remains high as its 30 day implied volatility is about 187% higher than its one-year realized volatility.

Some expected moves for the upcoming week: USO: 7%, XLE 4.2%, XOM: 4.2%, CVX: 4.2%, OXY, 7.6%, BTU: 12.4%, WEAT: 9.2%.

Even though IV cam in a bit in these names last week, they continue to show up on the High IV vs historical lists, with interest rate and currency-related ETFs also showing high IV vs historical:

The shares rose in late trading. 

Adjusted earnings were $4.83 a share for the quarter ending Nov. 30, above analysts’ [estimates](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FDX:US). The latest figure was in line with what it reported a year earlier, when U.S. cities were locked down to slow the spread of Covid-19. Revenue rose 14% to $23.5 billion, driven by price gains.

resczw_FDX,FDX,"Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, IWM, BTC, ETH, TSLA, FDX .","## The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week 3.5% higher (or about $16). That was more than the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. Implied volatility fell sharply with the move higher in the market.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.3% move (about $6 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY $471 that is a range of about $465 to $477.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 18, down sharply from 30 the prior week. That means expected moves quickly went from historically high to more in line with historical averages in a few days.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **1.3%** (about $6)
* QQQ **1.8%** (about $5)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5.50)
* DIA **1.4%** (about $5)

As mentioned last week:

*“If the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.”*

Volatility did quickly contract. The SPY ended the week up $16 but most bullish long premium strategies needed that large move higher with options already pricing an $11 move.

VIX futures are now back to a fairly steep contango after a brief spell of backwardation. December VIX futures dropped from 28.50 to 20, while Jan and Feb dropped from around 28 to about 23. May dropped from 27.50 to 25.50. Volatility assumptions for the next week few weeks are now lower than assumptions for January and beyond.

With most earnings out of the way, markets will likely be focused on macro events and year end positioning for the next few weeks. With last week's quick compression in implied volatility near term options are no longer pricing the wild swings we saw the past few weeks but that could change quickly with any move lower. On the flipside, a stable market into year end might see options compress even more as options need to price in shorter holiday weeks.",2021-12-12,200,49

I held FDX for a while and then sold on Wednesday, as I have concerns about the future growth of the company.

I feel like we are beginning to see the reversal of that now that physical retail is beginning to reopen.

Faces challenges with labor and new competition from Amazon; but the entire pie of shipping/delivery is growing and will continue to grow almost indefinitely.

What are the risks of holding through the earnings? I'm bullish on the stock but last time I tried to play the earnings on FDX it cost me greatly.

m51lsn_CRWD,CRWD,"Expected moves for this week. Tesla, SPY, CRWD, NKE, FDX and more.","**Market Volatility**

Last week the major indices rallied to new highs. Options were pricing in about a 2% move last week and the SPY climbed by nearly 3%. With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:

**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**

As I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.

**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices to new highs. Tesla (TSLA) was higher on the week by nearly $100. With the stock now just below $700, Tesla (TSLA) options are pricing in an expected move of about 7% for this week, down slightly from last week. Options are pricing in a roughly 15% move for the next month (to April 16th), also slightly less than last week. In other words, following last week's rally, Tesla options are pricing in less of an expected move now than they were a week ago:

https://i.redd.it/1oxa2v3ui1n61.gif

**GameStop (GME).** After a wild week of moves, and the stock now near $270, options are pricing about a 30% move in either direction for this week, corresponding to roughly $185 on the downside and $350 to the upside:

Remember the expected move is simply what the options market is pricing and is best used as a consensus for bullish and bearish positioning in the market. Think of it like a point spread in a game. Those short premium need the under, those long premium are looking for the over. Before choosing strikes and positioning know that that is essentially what you are doing versus the crowd.

This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are inexpensive and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\_medium=Social&utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, which should run into ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.
* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever from yahoo finance. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.
* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit.

The consensus is that their earnings might take a hit once Covid is over, but is that the case though? The vaccine roll out is just 5-10% of their total volume & once travel begins, then FDX will get back parcel volumes from the passenger airlines.

I fully understand that, on a balanced scorecard, the market is unpredictable and that even the best analysis can steer you wrong. That said, I do think I made some mistakes and I'm hoping this sub can help identify them :). 

1 -  On Dec 15th (a few days before earnings) I bought 1 FDX $290 call ($11.70) set to expire on Dec 24th. The stock was trading in the mid 280s so I figured it was relatively safe bet. 

Reasoning: Fedex has seen incredible growth this year due to covid, and with e-commerce sales this holiday year doing more than the [last decade combined](https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/12/01/cyber-week-online-shopping.html#gs.oh659f) (all those packages had to get delivered somehow). That coupled with the fact that they would be one of the primary vaccine delivery companies, all signs pointed that earnings would be strong, and the market would react well. Man, was I wrong.  


2 - Fedex announced their earnings [which were stellar](https://s21.q4cdn.com/665674268/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FedEx-Q2-FY21-Earnings-Release.pdf)

* Quarterly revenue hit an all-time high (20B)
* Adjusted earnings were $4.83 when estimate s were $4.01.  


3 - Stock sank like a stone (is now $268)

Here's what I don't understand... They beat earnings by a lot, hit record sales, and things for them aren't going to slow down anytime soon as long as covid is still around. 


Even removing macro events  (stimulus talks, new strain of covid, etc.) from the situation, this doesn't make sense.  

So experts, what did I miss? What should I have done different? Or is this just another one of ""those things"" where the market had its own plans? In other words school me

ipqh6q_FDX,FDX,More FDX DD,"Fedex announced they are going to hire 70,000 new employees for this holiday season, on-top of the already new employees they’ve already added because they are so busy.

In 2019 they added 55,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $165 this christmas season)

In 2018 they added 55,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $225 this christmas season)

In 2017 they added 50,000 seasonal jobs (stock was $260 this christmas season)

They announced they were increasing their rates in January of 2020 and UPS did as well.

When covid happened they announced a temporary surcharge on fedex express and TNT international parcel and freight shipments starting April 6th. 
Surcharges are still ongoing today, with rates being increased either 4.5x or 9x on August 9th (0.10 -> 0.45 -> 0.90 and freight shipping from China to Europe or US is a $1.60 surcharge)

On August 18th they stated-

“As the impact of COVID-19 continues to generate a surge in residential deliveries, we are entering this holiday peak season with extremely high demand for capacity and are experiencing increased operating costs across our network. We anticipate residential volume to continue to surge into the new year.” 

Then they added another surcharge and fees which are effective until Nov-Dec depending on the package. For example, in 2019 peak oversize was 37.50, in 2020 its 52.50. 

They also made their peak holiday season longer, last year it started on Oct 21, this year it starts on Oct 5th. Last year also ended on Jan 5th, this year it ends on Jan 17th.

They are now working seven days a week, delivering on Sundays to meet the demand.

Walmart, target and dicks all said online sales rose 97%, 195% and 194% respectively in their latest earnings calls 

BOA raised the price target of fedex from 177 to 235 then 235 to 255 all within the last two weeks. Berenberg raised fedex to 280 a week ago

ilni54_FDX,FDX,PTON & FDX: The last remaining tickers this earnings season with positive momentum.,"**PTON** will be reporting on 9/10 after hours and all signs point towards an earnings beat. Peloton offers great long-term financing options with monthly payments comparable to a recurring gym subscription plan. In light of the largely unchanged COVID-19 situation, it seems likely that many users ditched their local gym or offerings like ClassPass for good and replaced it with premium Peloton classes in a safe and convenient at home environment. Proud new Peloton owners are all over social media. Moms can even babysit and bike at the same time. I am looking at 9/18 $95C that could be entered on a red day (maybe tomorrow) / temporary premium drop -- no, it's not too :) Positions could be flipped on 9/10 before market close. Holding through earnings might not be advised depending on the run-up and given potential supply chain issues. Deliveries are currently still taking 8 weeks on average according to Peloton phone customer support :) 

**FDX:** Fedex is one of the last major earnings plays this quarter making it “the last chance to fomo for retail investors”. There aren’t any negative news going into earnings that should stop the run-up. FDX ground is operating at max capacity and the b2b segment is slowly coming back. The outlook going into holidays should be strong as well given the announced premium surcharges for high volume shippers. I’m looking at 10/16 $250 OTM calls that could be flipped or secured with a credit spread the day of earnings.

**TLDR:** There aren't any other tickers left for semi-responsible WSB degens to dump $$$ in this earnings season. Hold PTON and FDX calls until day of earnings.

**Neutral**

First thing is an iron condor isolating the earnings, with expiration this Thurs. This is about a 1 to 1 risk reward with short strikes set at the 131 and  147 level. It's a bet that FDX does not violate its expected move. Any close between 131 and 147 is max gain, and close below 130 or above 148 means max loss. The interesting thing about this trade is it's essentially putting a band around the recent highs and lows of the stock over the past month (teeny on the chart because it's just 2 DTE). The options market has a way of doing that.

This is a tough one on breakevens. The long 140/155 call spread doesn't breakeven until 145.44 in the stock and the recent highs in the stock were only to 150. The Short 140/120 put spread isn't obvious risk/reward risking 13 to make 7, however, that breakeven puts it at about $133 in the stock with high probability. I'd look at it that way and I think it makes sense for those that would be a buyer in the stock anyway at those levels. That trade would make money even with the stock slightly lower,  and it wouldn't matter how feeble a rally was from here because it would make max gain on any close above 140.

Now could be the best time for Amazon (AMZN) to dramatically increase the size of its air fleet. That’s according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, who sees the depressed price of aircraft, coupled with the massive increase in demand for delivery services spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, as a golden opportunity for the ecommerce giant to pump cash into its Amazon Air division.

And while that would help Amazon increase its one-day shipping capabilities, it could also give it the firepower it needs to solidify its nascent third-party delivery business as a true competitor to the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS).",2020-05-27,2030,215

fllaq6_FDX,FDX,FedEx (FDX) - Solid LT growth story hampered by ST pessimism,"Hey everyone, long-time lurker here who finally found the guts to post a DD. Today I want to talk about FedEx. Full disclosure, I am and have been long the stock since it dropped after 2Q earnings and have added more since then. I view FDX as a stable business that should grow in-line with global GDP in the long-term, and the growth of e-commerce globally could provide another secular tailwind for earnings growth. 

The stock is currently down ~60% from its ATH due to high capex spend in recent years, trade war impacts, and poor overall execution following the TNT acquisition. I think the stock is currently undervalued, and I am looking to hold it for the next 3-5 years for the following reasons:

1. China is ramping back up the economy per multiple accounts (commentary from recent earnings calls/interviews as I wouldn’t rely on CCP sources), and FDX has a chance to steal market share from passenger airlines that have reduced international flight capacity due to the coronavirus. Passenger airlines also carry cargo, which creates an opportunity for FDX to fill the gap. This should help them weather the economic downturn better than what the stock price currently implies. Even if Street consensus ($10.95/sh FY21 EPS or 10.2x P/E) is cut by 30%, the company would be trading at a 14.5x multiple on next year’s earnings, which I think is cheap for a company that should at least grow in-line with the global economy.

2. FDX has averaged ~$5Bn of annual cash from ops in the past 5 years, though it spent about the same amount on upgrading its aircraft fleet and sorting facilities. The capex spend will taper off by the end of FY22 (fiscal year ending in May 2022), unlocking significant FCF. Reducing capex to $3.5B (historical level before the current investment program) could increase FCF by ~$1.5-2Bn, while decreasing it to 80% of CFO (in-line with historical % of CFO) could increase it by $1Bn. For reference, UPS spent ~35% of their CFO on capex before their latest investment cycle. As the Street is focused on next years earnings per usual, the reduction in capex spend is not currently factored into the FCF estimates.

3. Lastly, integrating TNT, upgrading the aircraft fleet/sorting facilities, and finally combining Express and Ground shipments, which the company previously refused to do could help FDX expand its EBITDA margins and grow its international revenue-base. UPS has averaged ~15% EBITDA margin the past 5 years, which FDX underperformed that by 200bps, accounting for ~$2Bn cost disadvantage. Closing that gap could increase their return on invested capital that’s already in the double-digits, and could increase FCF by a total of $4Bn when combined with the reduced capex spend. This also isn’t factored into out-year Street estimates, and my estimates are not giving the company any credit for international revenue growth, so there could be potential upside to them.

Overall, I could see the stock hitting $180/sh if the first catalyst materializes, $200-300 with the first and second one combined, and $300+ if all three of them become reality.

Glad to discuss any questions/pushbacks on the stock. I am looking to improve my investment process and become a better investor along the way, so any feedback would be much appreciated.

Best,

b2x2ik_FDX,FDX,What’s your move with FDX?,"FedEx (FDX) delivers packages and freight a a global network of customers. The company’s main business segments include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx freight, and FedEx services. FedEx Express makes up 57.4% of revenue, but only 45.2% of operating income. This segment credits itself as the largest express transportation company in the world, reaching over 220 countries and territories. FedEx Ground is responsible for 29.2% of top line, which converts to 45.7% of operating income. This segment delivers to US and Canadian businesses, and can reach 100% of continental US residents. FedEx freight earns 10.8% of revenue, and includes freight services of any length. FedEx services controls 2.6% of revenue, and includes various business services to support the company’s transportation services. The business currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 10.4x, representing a 29.12% discount to the company’s 1 year average multiple of 14.8x. The main reasons for the selloff is slower integration with the TNT Express acquisition, slowdowns in global economies, and competition from Amazon, which as explained below, is completely overblown. 

FDX acquired TNT Express, an air and delivery services company, providing FDX with exposure to a deep European and Asian network. In FY’17, FDX announced a profit improvement goal of TNT of $1.2B to $1.5B between 2017 and 2020. In the company’s 2Q’19 earnings release, management noted this goal would not be reached, but still provided positive news regarding the integration process. At the time of the 2Q’19 call, 70% of the global sales force had been integrated, and the freight products and specialty services segments are growing rapidly. One reason for failing to miss the profit improvement target is a cyber attack the company faced in 2017. The Petya attack cost FDX $300mm in earnings, but since this attack was a one-time event that was not a result of weak business, I don’t think it deserves to damage the market value of FDX. Another reason for investor worries around this integration are high integration program expenses of $1.5B through 2020, which will include $450mm in FY’19. FDX is utilizing productivity-enhancing tools (bots, analytics, AI, etc.) to reduce the number of staff positions needed between the FDX and TNT. These high integration costs will likely be the last FDX has to pay, and they might decrease depending on the amount of positions cut. Finally, the global growth slowdown is a likely reason for the lower confidence in the business, which is explained more below. 

Another reason for the extremely discounted P/E multiple is from concerns around the recent global economic slowdown. There is no denying the economic uncertainty economies around the world have been facing. Brexit has created economic uncertainty in the UK, Eurozone growth slowed from 2.5% in 2017 to under 2% in 1H’18, emerging Asian growth has slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2Q’18, world trade grew 3.5% in 2Q’18, compared with 5.3% growth in the same period a year earlier. Italy and Germany are dealing with slowing GDP, and the entire global economy has dealt with the trade tensions between the US and China. International revenue makes up ~33.4% of revenue, so does FXD deserve to trade at a lower multiple? Sure. But does this justify a nearly 30% discount? I don’t think so. The segment most exposed to international revenue is the FedEx Express segment, which is made up of 56.4% international revenue. Even with the global political slowdown, this segment’s revenue grew 5.8% in 2Q’18 compared to the same period a year earlier. This segment has also grown at a 1.4% compounded quarterly growth rate, showing there is still financial strength amid slowing demand. Investors also overlooked the other three segments, which have seen tremendous strength from a strong US economy, and make up over half of the company’s revenue. This growth was fueled from a 4.9% increase in General Rate Increases (GRI) for the Ground and Express segments, and a 5.9% GRI increase in the company's Freight segment. Overall I think the global economic slowdown justifies a declining P/E multiple, but not a decline as large as what FDX experienced. 

Another reason for the discounted multiple is competition from Amazon, who has expressed interest to enter the logistics business. AMZN announced a 50 plane expansion to its Amazon Air fleet, and a $1.5B operating hub scheduled to open in Kentucky in 2021 with capacity for 100 planes. The company already handles 26% of its shipment centers and 185 fulfillment centers, and some analysts think its recent growth plans will cut into FDX’s market share. I think it is a ridiculous claim to compare AMZN as a legitimate competitor to FDX, and does not warrant a declined multiple. FDX recently stated AMZN accounted for less than 1.3% of calendar 2018 revenue, and is not a significant threat. Additionally, FDX’s history is made up of a series of purchases and acquisitions to build one of the most intricate global networks. If anyone thinks AMZN becomes a serious competitor when why buy a few planes and open 1 operating hub, they’re simply crazy. AMZN will not be a significant competitor in the short run, and any uncertainty around this news is completely overblown. 

FDX is also implementing multiple initiatives to insure its multiple trades back to fair value. FDX announced FedEx Extra Hours, a service that delivers products after regular operating hours for next day delivery and local two day deliveries. Customers already include  AutoZone and Best Buy, with plans to expand to more retailers. The company is growing FedEx OnSite, a service that allows customers and FDX associates to pick up and drop off packages through a retail outlet. This service is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including 8,900 Walgreens stores, helping the company utilize the growing e-commerce market to attract customers. I am also confident FDX’s large market share, increasing efficiency measures, expanding operations, and strong financial history will help it retain its customer base and growing sales. 

For 3Q’18, analysts are expecting adjusted EPS of $3.14, representing a (15.6%) YoY decline. This value has been revised downward by (1.64%) in the last four weeks. Revenue is expected to come in a $17.7B, accounting for a 6.9% (nice) YoY increase. My overall consensus is that FDX’s multiple was unfairly sold off in 2018, and I would buy calls long term. For earnings after the bell on Tuesday (3/16), this is a literal bet. I think investors will focus on management guidance for the integration with TNT Express, and see how financials have been impacted from the global slowdown. Since the stock is trading at such a discount, I don’t think investors are looking for much, but weak guidance could still have severe impacts. I’m probably going with calls, or I might wait until after earnings to buy calls. Let me know what you guys are thinking. 

TDLR: I probably won’t play earnings, but will consider calls depending on the management call.

Management is really bullish long term due to globalization and e-commerce all around the globe but the company is facing some macro economic headwind and management recently cut guidance.

FDX took a \~40% hit in the correction. Up slightly off the lows but still way down relative to where it was. PE is 9. Dividend is currently 1.5% with a very low payout ratio - maybe this could have a nice dividend growth story going forward?

In summary, this seems like a very solid company trading at a huge discount. Seems like it could be a slow and steady gainer with limited downside going forward.",2019-01-21,41,39

9gqyww_FDX,FDX,FedEx (FDX) buy on weakness?,"FedEx reported earnings this afternoon after market close. The company missed on EPS by a decent margin (9%) but a slight beat on revenue

EPS est: $3.803

EPS actual: $3.46

Revenue est: $16.87B

Revenue actual: $17.05B


The EPS miss, as you can surmise, was an issue with expenses coming in higher than expected, leaving the lowest operating margin in quite some time (20.4%).

An 11% increase in wages drove the margin deterioration, an impact the CEO noted they expected: 

""As expected, the quarter's results were affected by our decision to invest in our team members following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We remain committed to increasing earnings, margins, cash flows and returns this year.""

The company estimated that hiring and wage growth reduced EPS by $0.48, covering more than the EPS miss (though they also saw a $.50 EPS boost from a lower tax rate), partly driven by the TNT cyberattack. 

While the results were mixed (the EPS miss weighs more than the revenue beat) the company actually ended up **raising** full year guidance from $17.00-$17.60 to $17.20-$17.80. The company expects strong performance in FY19 (this was Q1 19 for them) on the back of parcel delivery and strong e-commerce.

It was reported last week that FedEx expects to hire ~55,000 seasonal workers for the winter holiday, up from the 50,000 they expected to hire last year and the 50,000 they expected in 2016. 


Despite the miss, FedEx also got analyst upgrades today (and some yesterday before ER):

FDX is currently trading well below its 2 year average forward P/E, touching the bottom range of its forward P/E standard deviation Reaching it's historical average would imply a $270.36 price.

https://i.imgur.com/RpPpA7w.png

Though no one here cares about dividends, FedEx has also grown their dividend 27% over the past year, 36% annual over the past two years, and 31% annually over the past five, with the after hours price drop likely pushing the dividend yield over 1%. 

With Amazon, Wal-Mart, and other giant retailers exploding e-commerce, FedEx and other logistic companies have to shift from infrastructures built for traditional big box retail to those lead by a more tech economy. FedEx expects little to no impact from US/China tariffs (China represents just 2% of their revenues and tariffs effect little of that 2%). The company is also moving to six day workdays to meet holiday demand alongside the seasonal hiring boost. 

The option market priced in a 1.5% move after earnings, but it looks like the sell off will be almost double that. That's obviously not a good sign, but when the dust settles, FedEx could be a good buy on earnings shock and optimistic outlook. ",2018-09-18,29,24

I believe this day we could breakout the 12K resistance and ETH already went 10% up which means in my opinion that we could see an altcoin bull run again; so here my best picks for fast growth recovery coins and long potential growth/hold:

* FDX 52M: World's 1st Marketplace for Tradable Insurance Policies; tackling a trillion dollar industry. Went down around 60% during the crash. They are very close on getting to a new exchange and are now starting to work on their marketing efforts. short-term potential for 3x

* PRL 73M: Changing the way of monetizing websites with banner ads and  distributing storage. This coin was one of the rising stars before the crash but went totally down 27K to 10K. It has been already trying to break out a few times again but afterwards a quick sell off by people that were taking their losses (people that bought in at 20K btc). Safe choice and I see short-term potential for 2x

* WISH 13M: A library of smart contracts and marketplace where you can create/take without any programming skills your crypto herritage, wedding, kid savings contract etc. Went from 16K to 6.5K; a full cycle down. Short term potential to 4/5x. 

* OPT 10,5M: The first decentralized music platform, competing with Voise 35M but their team and whitepaper looks more serious. Went from 1500 to 600 now is on HitBTC and only and has fixed orders which made it difficult to break out. Now the market is picking up I believe it can break out again and then it can go really fast. 

* SNOV 41M: first decentralized lead generation platform. Went full cycle down from 2500 to 900 btc. In Q1 they will have their new marketplace launch and have already more than 18K people that downloaded their chrome extension. 

* XBL 1.2M: Decentralized gamble games on the blockchain with token burn deflationary mechanism to keep increasing the value of the coin. This coin went from 11k to 3K and is truly a high risk/ high reward coin, when it takes off then you 10x potential but in the same case it stays at this current level. 

* Wand 7.5M: Smart contract architecture enabling seamless creation and trade of any ERC20 Token or combination of them. This coin has a super low market cap still as it is only on ED but they are close to a new exchange and in March they are launching their pilot marketplace. Then this coin can go towards a 150M cap.

* MTX 23M: Collaborative Research & Development Engine decentralized platform combined with VR where the coins are used as bounty rewards. This coin is so low because it is at this moment only on ED and what many people don't know is that the circulating supply is 23M/ total supply  34M, while on CMC it still says 300M

Other coins that I own and definitely worth looking into as well but some already increased very fast but still all low caps and many room to grow: BPT, ARY, AIX, ELT, B2B, GET, BLUE, ATL)

7rlec7_FDX,FDX,"Post here your coins to buy if you missed buying on the dip (My picks: OPT, WABI, FDX, , WAND, PRL, APPC, ELTCOIN, ATL - see why)","Hope you all survived the storm with not too many losses and are ready for the new altcoin boom period.

Basically what I did to survive the storm was to sell off almost all of my 26 altcoins and change them into usdt. I was planning to buy alts back at the dip but unfortunately when I woke up most of all coins had already recovered a bit and grew by 30/50%.

I have been shopping all day to research and look for coins that did not recover yet and will make the same growth hopefully this weekend, or still need to be discovered by the average investor and will then grow fast in the future (I still have some coin to spare so would love to hear your suggestions):

* OPT 12M: The worlds first decentralized music platform; it was just breaking out before the storm and reached 0.25$ but got stopped by it and now at 0.9$ but this one has the potential to grow fast 5/6x very undervalued and unknown until now, already on cryptopia which means that it can grow quite fast to 100M.

* Wabi 130M: Normally I am not focused on coins over 100M market cap but this coin has been steadily growing and was just breaking out as well before the storm. I think this coin can break out over the weekend still that is why I stepped in now (they have a great product against counterfeiting focused on mainly food products in China).

* FDX 65M: World's 1st Marketplace for Tradable Insurance Policies. It went already a bit up today but when this project/coin hits better exchanges then it will be for sure a top 100 coin and going to 400M at least.

* Wand 8.5M: a peer to peer trading platform; very good concept. They use their coin to trade other coins and real products but using both BTC, Ethereum and Wand to keep the price stable. This coin is only on ED and when it hits other exchanges then it can grow to 300M market cap for sure.

* PRL 100M: this project I actually bought and sold 2 times already. This is such a great project; that was going really fast up but because it is so new it also went very fast down. Today actually it went again with 15% down, so the perfect moment to step in now. It went from 4.23$ to 1.60$ now and will soon make its way up to 400M probably.

* APPC 149M:  Is a decentralized app store using their tokens; their ico was completely sold out and when it came to the market the coin went up to 5$. Now the price is at 1.5$ and almost not affected by the red wave; so I believe they will soon reach at least 3.5$ again (as it just stopped dropping). 

* Eltcoin 6M: instant crypto to fiat conversion platform; this coin just was getting a bit more name in the market and went up to 0.22$ now back to 0.06/7$. It is on the minor exchanges but when it hits other exchanges I see a fast growth to the 100M.

* ATL 14M: Decentralized real estate platform (read previous posts). Went all the way up from 2.70$ now to 1.08$ they were growing really fast but because of the storm stopped will probably as well grow 5/6x hopefully in the first two months.

This time not such a descriptive post on all the details; I urge you always to do your own researching before investing.

3kyo6s_FDX,FDX,[Discussion] $FDX (Fedex) and the transportation/service sector,"So last week Krogers mentioned during there conference call that one of the big reason why they beat the expectation on this quarter was because of cheap fuel. 

Anyways Fedex is about announce their earnings report this week and I was wondering if anyone would agree on the notion that Fedex will beat expectation thanks to cheap fuel. Or is there something going with the trasportation/service sector that would spell bad earnings for Fedex. Thanks",2015-09-14,6,5

13bban_FDX,FDX,I want to invest in Amazon.com and complemant it with either Fedex or Ups. I would like to hear your opinion regarding which delivery company has better prospects and also your opinion on Amazon.com,"So this is going to be my very first stock investing.

I love amazon.com. Been shopping on it for years. Love their user interface, love the fact they sell used books in addition to new books, love their related product algorithm (which sometimes is scary in its accuracy).

I would like to hear your thoughts about:

1. Amazon.com long term prospects. I think retail overall is dying a slowly but surly death. Although I hate the whole kindle eco system (limited and setback android versions, stupid book drm bullshit) I think overall amazon have it made and is my main online shopping solution. One looming threat is the whole sales tax loop hole fanegaling they have going on and which I anticipate to be closed in a short period of time.

2. Which of the delivery companies have stronger prospects in the long run? I know very little about the nuances in that industry. 

3. How do I find which delivery service amazon.com prefers/uses more? Ups or Fedex?

Basically my thought is that the world is moving globally to more and more e-commerce solutions and no matter what business it is they will heavily rely on physical delivery companies. By investing in amazon and its preferable (for whatever reasons) delivery supplier I will achieve a synergy effect. Thoughts?",2012-11-16,20,44
