1kt8tcf_FSLR,FSLR,FSLR coming stock trend & valuation,May I know its worthiness for investing FSLR after the passing of the cut of solar tax credit in lower house of the Congress?,2025-05-23,6,8
1jag0e4_FSLR,FSLR,Convince me not to buy a large chunk of FSLR?,"American made (Trump loves)

Elon makes $ of solar tax incentives (Trump won't bite the hand that feeds him)

Extremely profitable (even if incentives are removed it is a profitable company)

Solar may not be the future with alternatives, but it is sustainable and a supremely green product, which is/was hot right now

Tanked 60% from highs, so it has the ability to be that valued

90% instituonal owned",2025-03-13,0,26
1j2reza_FSLR,FSLR,First Solar Stock - Possible Win Case Scenario?,"Hello everyone, 

I've been checking the FSLR stock recently and became interested by this stock, which somewhat appears to me as a value stock. 

First of all, it seems like all the analyst are fond of FSLR. With most of them consistently recommending the stock. Most of the owners of FSLR are institutional holders, which could potentially indicate that the stock is viewed as a good stable long-term investment.

Second, it seems like the stock is heavily undervalued. With the lowest analyst price target being 150 (compared to the current price of 130) and the average being 245,14. Simply wallstreet estimate FSLR to be undervalued around 40% to 50%. 

Then, the financials of the organization seems to be quite solid. A pretty good debt-to-equity ratio (4 billion to 8 billion = 0.5) and the company seems quite liquid with a 1 billion as current asset. Its Enteprise Value is lower than its market cap, showcasing that the company has more cash than debt; as Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents. (EV = 13.51B < Market Cap 14.58B)

Moreover, the market that they operate in, which is the thin film PV, is set to grow with a CAGR of **7.7%** between 2025 and 2030, which means that the market will grow about 45% within 5 years. With First Solar being a dominant player and holding many critical thin film PV patents, it can be expected that they will capitalize on a big market share of that growing market. The thin film PVs market is still the smallest market in PVs, but with its growth, the company can secure long term contracts with businesses, as those products tend to be associated with businesses offering a B2B like business model. Thin film PV technology is usually suited for large-scale commercial and industrial applications due to its higher efficiency in hot climates and better performance in low-light conditions compared to traditional crystalline silicon panels, which are usually catered to individual consumers like us. 

However, the journey ahead of FLSR seems to be quite elusive with the new Trump admin, that does not seem to be keen on subsidizing green energy and will continue  raising tariffs, which will hurt the business. Also, the chinese competition in solar PV seems to be quite ferocious, presenting a risk to the company. 

Personally, I am enclined to invest in the organization, but I feel a bit hesitant, especially with the current climate with the Trump administration and the current market situation.

What do you guys think of the FSLR stock? and the overall market condition?",2025-03-03,2,6
1i1zfzx_FSLR,FSLR,Thoughts on FSLR?,"Looking for opinions on FSLR (First Solar). The stock is currently trading around $190, about 35% below its all-time high of $300. PE ratio is ~16.5, which seems reasonable for the solar industry. With the recent focus on renewable energy and government incentives, do you think it’s a buy at these levels? Curious about your thoughts on long-term potential and any risks I might be overlooking.",2025-01-15,3,14
1hnhy67_FSLR,FSLR,Bull or bear for FSLR?,"I’ve looked over the numbers for First Solar (FSLR), and I’ve I feel like there’s a discrepancy between their financials and their market price. They’re almost 30% down  in the last 90 days, but have had pretty strong growth in the last year or so.

- Their gross income increased almost 1,000% in 2023, and it looks like it has remained steady this year so far.

- They own a decent portion of the US solar market (~20%) and have begun breaking into other international markets like India.

- EPS and PE stats look very strong with $4.91 and 15.83, respectively.

- With supposed Trump tariffs incoming, Chinese solar panel suppliers which are typically cheaper may struggle to compete.

This is clearly an optimistic and simplified summary of the company so what am I missing here exactly? A stock like that doesn’t drop that far for no reason. Is the the threat of Chinese competition that omnipresent? Underlying issues with their product? I’m curious what y’all think.",2024-12-27,18,29

Reasonable PE, 16 and forward of 9

10% quarterly rev growth yoy and 16% earnings growth

Strong bookings

50% of US produced panels 

Their 5th US factory is being built now. 

Lastly, P/C ratio shows buying enthusiasm and I think the sell off is mostly concern over alt energy with new administration. Leadership believes they will benefit from tariffs and are strongly positioned.

1fr7dxe_FSLR,FSLR,First Solar: My (quick) analysis,"**My Investment Thesis:**

A major player in the solar photovoltaic field, with a concentration on large-scale solar projects and a dedication to improving its thin-film solar module technology. FSLR is able to capitalize on its U.S. market presence thanks to favorable policy incentives (Inflation Reduction Act), despite facing hard competition from traditional crystalline silicon technologies. Strong financial position, with a backlog of 75.9 GW in contracts through 2030 and a solid cash position of $1.74 billion. The new R&D innovation center in Ohio and the adoption of its bifacial Series 6 Plus modules place the company in a position for future growth.

Low Price/Forward Earnings and PEG ratios, compared to its 5-year averages. Based on my Fair Price estimate, currently may be undervalued by a significant 51.86%. I believe there is a good opportunity for potential entry, or at least, to add it to your watchlist.

[Quick analysis](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcrowsx/comments/1fr793p/first_solar_my_quick_analysis/) (PNG images). [Download as PDF](https://www.patreon.com/posts/fslr-quick-three-112901170) (3 pages, 1.85MB).

*\*\*\*   \*\*\*   \*\*\**

**Fair Price:**

My Fair Price (Base Case) for **FSLR is $541.45**. The current price of $260.68 is lower by 51.86%.

* Fair-to-Current Price (%): 51.86%
* Current Price/Fair Price: 0.48

I used:

* Discount Rate: 12% *(S&P 500 Next 5-Yr Growth Estimates is 11.90%)*
* Margin of Safety: 30%
* Years: 10
* Future EPS Growth Rate: 20% *(See comments below)*
* Future Dividend and Buyback Yield: 0%
* Total Future Annual Growth Rate: 20 + 0 = 20%

Based on Yahoo Finance and Koyfin data, the next 5-year CAGR forecast is insanely 56%. Why did I take 20%:

* Constant shares outstanding dilution
* I expect an economic slowdown in the next 1-2 years
* High competition landscape

By the way, pay attention that my **forward 5-yr PEG ratio is 1.16**, which is low.

For the Base Case, the Future Expit P/E is 20. 5-year average P/E ratio is 34; I decided to just take the future EPS growth rate which is 20.

As you can see, the stock is undervalued in all cases — Base, Bull, and Bear. This is due to high future growth expectations. In justification of my assessments, I made a DCF valuation (see the Checklist below) and I got $529 which **is very close to my Base Case Fair Price estimate** ($541.45).

**❌** EPS growth YoY last 7 years: **No** *(Declines in 2018 and 2022)*

**Valuation and Advantage:**

Strong financials, good efficiency, good margins. Strong guidance for this year. Although these numbers haven't been very stable the years before. And all of their profit is going to capital expenditure (negative FCF), which is not necessarily a bad thing, but we'll have to see how much it pays off.

The recently announced China tariffs could also benefit them.

1b2a7g3_FSLR,FSLR,"First Solar jumps on strong quarter, record backlog","First Solar shares jumped Wednesday after reporting another solid quarter, with the company booked solid through 2026 and an order backlog that stretches into the end of the decade.

The stock traded as much as 9% higher on the day. It was last up about 2%.

Here’s how the company did in the fourth quarter:

Net income rose 30% year over year to $349.2 million from $268.3 million

Earnings per share of $3.25 beat an LSEG estimate of $3.13

Revenue of $1.15 billion was slightly below a consensus forecast of $1.31 billion

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said the revenue miss was more than offset by strong margins of 43.3%, compared to consensus estimates of 37.7%.

First Solar has a record order backlog of 80.1 gigawatts stretching through the end of the decade with the company completely booked through the next two years.

First Solar is one of the few companies that has weathered the sharp downturn in the solar sector. While the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) has plummeted 43% over the past 12 months, First Solar is down 6.2% over the same period.

High interest rates pummeled the highly leveraged residential solar sector, but First Solar’s focus on large, utility-scale projects has insulated the company from the macroeconomic headwinds.

“We continue to believe FSLRs extended visibility into margin levels and cash flows provides a relative safe haven for investors,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse told clients in a note. JPMorgan has a price target of $226 for the stock, implying about 56% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets on the back of First Solar’s quarterly report. Deutsche sees First Solar rising to 44% to $210 per share, while Morgan Stanley is expects upside of 69% to $245 per share.

“The company message is clear and loud - solid growth ahead, with increased capacity coming online and two new US facilities being built up,” Deutsche analyst Corinne Blanchard told clients Wednesday.

“FSLR is utility exposed, and therefore we believe isolated from the current ongoing challenges for the rest of the solar space,” Blanchard wrote. “The company also has a solid balance sheet, therefore reducing macro related headwinds.”

But there are potential headwinds on the horizon with bookings expected to slow after two bumper years. CFO Alexander Bradley told analysts on the company’s earnings call that First Solar will be “highly selective” with its contracting in 2024 as U.S. presidential and congressional elections later this year create uncertainty for the renewable sector.

Analysts are worried that Republicans might seek to weaken or repeal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act if they win unified control of government.

And CEO Mark Widmar told analysts that Chinese subsidization and dumping has led to a collapse in cell and module in key international markets such as India and Europe.

Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for First Solar to $265 from $275 prior despite the company’s strong quarter. The investment bank said solar module oversupply and potential changes to U.S. tax credits are key risks for First Solar moving forward.

The last year has been wild as they aggressively swung to profitability but questions always remained if they could sustain it.  Well not only did they beat eps this quarter but for 2024 they guided to $13-14 eps. The sp500 is currently trading at 23.27 average pe. That means a lazy price target that ignores the fact that they are going from 7.73 eps in 2023 to 13-14 in 2024 and just uses the avg pe would put a 1 year price target on FSLR of 302.51- 325.78.

19046su_FSLR,FSLR,"Two Stocks Poised to Rebound: $SING (solar energy) and $DUOT (AI); $FSLR, $RUN, $CSIQ included"," **SING Friday Close:  $1.66**

**DUOT Friday Close: $2.57 (Up 27%)**  


Solar energy and air purification provider, **SinglePoint $SING**, ended last year with a chaotic uplisting to the Cboe from the OTC with a $4 million capital raise. Two reverse splits were executed (read---now a very low public float. Within days of the capital raise at $5.00/share and uplist to a higher exchange on December 19, there was a selloff and closed on Friday at $1.66. So, 800,000 shares are issued at $5.00 (with 100,000 shares bought by the CEO). Trading volume skyrocketed and the float turned over on many trading days (1.16 million shares traded just on Friday). Who is selling?  The recent investors in the $5/share capital raise selling their stock immediately at a loss? NO-- when you consider these new investors know that SING did over $25 Million in revenue over the past twelve months and the current market cap is a fraction of $25 million. This massive trading volume has to be from short selling that is not covered. There jsut is NOT enough shares out to account for this volume--but it does account for the decline that will be reverse when the short sellers cover. Solar Industry analysts are very positive for companies in this space--$FSLR, $RUN, $CSIQ. Just an opinion--but there is a possible naked short position that cannot be sustained for long. Watch for a turn in the SING chart.  


Another stock that is just beginning to turn up after a difficult 2023 (after tax loss selling) is **Duos Technologies $DUOT**, a provider of machine vision and artificial intelligence that analyzes fast moving vehicles (ie. railroad cars etc.). There was a well-circulated TTwitter rumor that the company was going to have to raise capit, but the CEO was interviewed on FRIDAY and made it clear that there was no need for a capital raise (and the stock started to rebound) and Amtrak backlog has grown. YouTube Interview here (starts at 2 minute point) [https://youtu.be/ZMEoQt25gAM?si=sU52j8P\_H6NIOwM8](https://youtu.be/ZMEoQt25gAM?si=sU52j8P_H6NIOwM8). Good technical analysis of the DUOT chart in this short interview. A couple of DUOT Class One clients are sponsoring DUOT with the American Association of Railroads to standardize technology in the railroad industry with Duos Technologies' solution.  The Railroad Safety Act bill is in the hands of Congress with support from both sides. Duos is specifically called out as a preferred technology within the bill if passed. This real Deep Machine learning and AI platform identifies potential safety issues on moving trains up to 125 miles an hour. DUOT's  portals still take images of safety points on every railcar that goes through their portals, where seasoned railroad safety inspectors inspect them in real-time—preventing potential derailments. DUOT is expanding their customer base beyond just the rail car operators and the rail cars' owners. DUOT's Fourth Quarter filing will reflect an increase in backlog, confirming DUOT's proof of concept.  The 600% increase  in trading volume on Friday may be the beginnings of a short squeeze and new investors seeing the opportunity",2024-01-06,8,9

FSLR only had one profitable quarter in last 4 quarters

**Catalyst** \- SPWR, the largest publicly traded installer, just [pre-released earnings](https://newsroom.sunpower.com/2023-07-26-SunPower-Reports-Preliminary-Second-Quarter-2023-Results-and-Provides-Updated-Guidance) a few days ago revising new customers down from 90k-110k in 2023, to 70k-90k. 70% of customers are already accounted for in that revision, meaning that demand fell off of a fucking cliff. SPWR sources all of their batteries and panels from other manufacturers, SPWR is basically a pure installer play.

**Rationale**  \- how can you maintain a growth premium on an industry that is guiding down when, by all accounts, we are in a fucking roaring economy and arguably a new bull market. Last quarters misses were all handwaved as cyclical. Are they ? Everyone blamed bad weather in california, and californias NEM 3.0 which basically incentivizes battery useage, this kicked in sometime in the last quarter. Everyone blamed NEM 3.0 for low battery sales while people tried to get grandfathered in to NEM 2.0.

&#x200B;

**Let's see what SPWR said last earnings**

""I think if I start with your question on California and the California bias, interestingly enough, if you go back to the call we had a few months ago, we gave our guidance of 10% to 30% growth for the year, roughly midpoint of 20. I think a number of folks were, I'll say, skeptical as to whether the industry was going to grow that fast. And I think after Q1, we feel increasingly confident that we'll be within that guidance.

And we were pleased that even with the weather impact, we were above the midpoint of the guidance, closer to the high end of the guidance. And interestingly enough, I mean, I think our share of California is a strength right now. The fact that we have a six month backlog of NEM 2.0 customers, and we're still now booking NEM 3.0 customers means that we're likely to have a really terrific business this year in California. I think it's premature to call any kind of potential upside to both customers and EBITDA per customer because the first quarter isn't yet, I think, a good indicator of what the full year looks like."" - SPWR management, sounding pretty confident that the worst was behind. That is a really curious statement seeing as how they just guided down years revenues -25% one quarter later when GDP is fucking ripping. How do you justify this ?

&#x200B;

**Let's see what ENPH said last earnings**

""Yeah. I think the storage volumes are going to go -- Q2 is probably the low. They're going to grow from here on and simply because of one reason. We are going to be introducing batteries to a lot more countries. We just introduced to four countries. And we are going to be introducing the third-generation battery in Q2 this quarter. Then, we are going to be introducing the third-generation battery into multiple countries in Europe.

So NEM 3.0 is a part of the equation, but not the only thing in the equation. And eventually, the installers are going to figure out how to sell batteries in the rest of the US, despite the high interest rates. So like what I said, I think we are turning the corner on batteries. 

It's only a week, as you said, we have talked to a number of installers. All of them are optimistic that their solar plus storage business can boom. They are all -- we shared solar graphs with them. We shared the designs. We showed them three examples per utility. We showed them how a pure solar case looks. We showed them that solar now in west-facing roofs is not bad. We showed them solar plus storage is actually better than NEM 2.0. or equivalent."" - ENPH management. Basically same optimism as SPWR. We'll see.

&#x200B;

**RISKS** : ENPH does 65% of their business in the US, I have no insight on international business, it is possible their international sales exploded. SPWR only operates in the US

FSLR is industrial solar. While I think the same thesis of demand being pulled forward applies to them, the SPWR news does not apply

**Positions** \- more skewed towards ENPH than FSLR because I think the bear case for ENPH is more solid. I just picked strikes with decent liquidity, way OTM. Good luck to anyone who chooses to play

But any ways those jabroni mostly sell residential solar and that is not what this post is about

This post is about the amazing FSLR which just set a new yearly high a week ago. Robbinhood69, u might ask, was their recent earnings good ?

Well, they had expected revenues of 716 million and reported 548 million. Expected EPS .95 and reported .40

Robbinhood69, was their guidance good ? They always guide stupidly optimistic

[Here](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-2022-Guidance/default.aspx) was their 4th quarter guidance for 2021, they guided EPS of 0 to 60 cents

[Q1](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-First-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) 2022 was   -41 cents, [Q2](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was 52 cents, [Q3](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was -46 cents, [Q4](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2023/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-2023-Guidance/default.aspx) was 7 cents for a total loss of -41 cents for 2022. BUT if you look at their Q4, they are projecting a 2023 EPS of 7 to 8 DOLLARS a share. How did [Q1](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2023/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx) 2023 go? Decent, 40 cents a share profit, with them reiterating their guidance which includes 660 million to 710 mil ""Section 45x"" tax benefits. This, you probably already knew, is the inflation reduction act tax benefit, which IMO is going to be the first thing cut during debt ceiling resolution.

Wall St has been asleep at the wheel allowing FSLR to guide high while losing money pursuing a growth at all costs strategy, which works until it doesn't. What could be the catalyst to kick the teeth in on this company trading at 8x forward P/S ? IMO it is the debt ceiling negotiations. The only serious proposals I've seen from the republican side (which IMO have a bit of an upper hand here) are cutting in these 4 areas - SNAP benefits, IRS budget, student loan forgiveness, and solar tax subsidies. Out of those 4 areas IMO the most palatable one is gonna be solar, that is not gonna cost either side voters and in general solar has already been a win for Buyden since a lot of solar demand got pulled forward from the inflation reduction act. Dems are gonna have to give in somewhere and IMO it's gonna be solar.

What does that do to FSLR ? THey directly get 660 million to 710 million in tax benefits, in addition their industrial customers get 1 of 2 tax benefits outlined [here](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/federal-solar-tax-credits-businesses), namely 30% tax credit on total cost OR a per kwh subsidy of 2.75c/kWH. FSLR is gonna get fucked, and their customers are gonna get fucked, and if you are a bull holding a stock that has generally overpromised and underdelivered on the cusp of losing a massive tailwind why would you continue to hold ?

Positions Dec 150p and 130p, I will hold until Cramer gets bearish on this stock and says something like ""with congress cutting solar subsidies i don't know how you can own this stock""

The climate bill — formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act — offers rebates and tax credits to consumers for climate-focused products such as electric vehicles and solar panel roof installations, while aiming to incentivize the manufacturing of clean energy products at home .

First Solar last month announced that it would invest up $1 billion to construct a new U.S. solar panel manufacturing plant. Markets have been impressed by the sector since its passage. Goldman’s coverage of solar companies has seen a rise of 30% to 40% in shares, and First Solar is no exception. We are pleased to report that our upgrade was not too early. Lee noted that the stock is up 64% in the six months since IRA legislation was introduced, but that there are still some upsides to what has quickly became a domestic solar manufacturing champ across our coverage.

Lee also anticipates more upside in 2023, 2024, as more people revise their estimates moving forward. First Solar shares have risen nearly 55% in the past year, but could rise another 28% from Wednesday’s closing. This is based on the bank’s $172 price target. Lee upgraded Maxeon Solar Technologies’ status to buy, while downgrading Canadian Solar and Shoals Technologies Group shares.

m42rpj_FSLR,FSLR,Just found a fucking gem. First attempt at DD. FSLR,"Edit: not financial advice. full disclosure I was denied options trading. ignore the following

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

m1a908_FSLR,FSLR,"$FSLR DD - 5/21 CALL, $70 strike","Wanted to provide some DD on a company that I feel has potential, $FSLR (First Solar).

I noticed this company after I received an alert about unusual options activity:

>$FSLR 5/21/2021 $70  
Type: CALLS  
Order: 926 @ 10.94  
Premium: $1,012,806  
Underlying: $76.55  
Daily Volume: 943  
OI: 46

Someone is clearly making a big bet that this company is going to be on the rise over the coming months. This company wasn't on my radar before, so after digging and research, I placed a similar call order. There has been a significant dip over the past few and I believe this is a good buy-in point for a few reasons outlined below.

**Price target:** $88.36 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/))

**What they do:**

First Solar designs, develops, manufactures and markets a line of thin-film semiconductor photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules that convert sunlight into electricity.

**Analyst's Investment Thesis:**

>We believe that First Solar is well positioned for future growth based on its solid balance sheet and focus on cadmium telluride technology, which should provide a cost advantage relative to more commoditized technologies like polysilicon.  The company is also benefiting from an expanding opportunity set of utility-scale projects. First Solar's balance sheet is clean and it has a solid book of contracted projects heading into the next few years. First Solar could also be an attractive acquisition target for an integrated oil company looking to bolster its renewable operations. We caution, however, that FSLR shares have a history of volatility, and that any sales or earnings disappointment could result in a sharp selloff. As such, we view FSLR as appropriate only for risk-tolerant investors as part of a diversified portfolio.

Solar is a growing industry, so placing a bet on any front-runner in this space isn't a bad play.

f769dz_ENPH,ENPH,Buy VSLR/RUN/SEDG/ENPH and how they are different from FSLR - Complete DD,"First and foremost, I have followed the energy sector for quite some time so I'll give my thoughts on what I see with the aforementioned stocks and the trajectory as a whole.

This was my post some several months ago when ENPH had it's big ITC drop; needless to say, I bought the dip but without much capital at the time. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph\_could\_be\_your\_next\_success\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph_could_be_your_next_success_story/)

That being said, let's jump in on the DD.

This year should be a great year for energy/green stocks with the rapid shifting of tech companies towards fully electric and renewable energy sources (namely TSLA, Intel, MSFT, Google, Apple, etc - all of which use solar energy as part of their operations). Considering the growth of the solar industry in the last year as well as software-driven solar tech, the energy market is consistently finding new opportunities to increase exposure in the greater market and making meaningful partnerships. Take for example Sun Power, which is one of the largest distributors of solar panels in the U.S, Phillips which is working on a sustainable energy source for TSLA vehicles, PLUG which is making deals with Amazon, Walmart, and potentially Home Depot. In fact, the U.S in 2019 has increased this sector's employment by 250,000 jobs in just Florida alone, and an increase in 31 states. Employment rate is oftentimes  a great predictor for an industry's health and outlook. Moreover, legislation such as CA Title 24 mandate requires all homes built after 2020 to have solar PV installed, and prior to this, following Lennar, Toll Brothers, and KBH, every new property developed in the last 2 years have solar installed and software-solar tech (automated thermostats). Another thing to consider is the cutting of door-to-door sales in many solar tech companies, and focusing on consultants that build partnerships for these companies. Vehicles are also starting to move into solar tech, with TSLA being the obvious front runner, but also fully electric Jaguars, MUSTANGS, and Audi's, all of which have never produced any fully electric, or even hybrid vehicles up until the recent years. The demand for solar is high and traditional energy providers (fossil fuels and standard energy providers) are starting to lose marketshare in the energy sector. This is mainly as a result of the growing issues and litigations over high winds, faulty equipment, and fires. If you take a look at solar installations, you will see a clear trend:

&#x200B;

Starts with ITC incentives have been very favorable towards these solar companies, and with the tiered tax credit incentive system that depreciates each year, people are incentivized to get this tech sooner than later. What the ITC means (for those that don't know), it's the investment tax credit which is a 26% federal tax deduction for installing solar tech in your home. And as the full electric auto market grows, there is a substantially larger percentage of residents that will have these installed. For those buying new homes this year and forward, they will come fully furnished. 

There are lots of catalyst in this space, everything from the automotive industry, real estate industry, software tech industry, ITC, and general move towards renewable energy. Cloud based platforms will require an immense amount of energy to run these cloud servers, and MSFT/Amazon are already all over solar tech. This area is also just starting to develop rapidly. 

My picks are, from most optimistic to least:

VSLR, RUN, SPWR, ENPH, SEDG 

Also, for those that are discussing FSLR, it was a huge miss but imo analyst had no reason to lift EPS this high and guidance last quarter was far too optimistic. One big reason why I believe FSLR failed is that they are the only utility-scale distributor in the mix. That means they only work with utility companies to provide energy on large grids, however, they do not fit into the category or have partnerships with commercial or residential units. Moreover, as utility companies are beginning to lose marketshare and are losing the trust of customers (especially in CA), I can only imagine that FLSR partnerships are suffering. Anyway, I lost money on my calls which will probably be at -90% at open. I thought it would ride the energy wave, but I was wrong.

- apparently FSLR is exempt from the tariff so this is probably good for them

**from First Solar's 10-k**:

- ""Application of U.S. trade laws, or trade laws of other countries, may also impact, either directly or indirectly, our operating results. For example, in April 2017, a U.S.-based manufacturer of solar cells filed a petition under Sections 201 and 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 for global safeguard relief with the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “USITC”). Such petition requested, among other things, the imposition of certain tariffs on crystalline silicon solar cells imported into the United States and the establishment of a minimum price per watt on imported crystalline silicon solar modules. In September 2017, the USITC determined such products are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the relevant domestic industry. The USITC has proceeded to the remedy phase of its investigation, following which it may recommend remedies, such as tariffs, quotas, or trade adjustment assistance, to the U.S. presidential administration. In October 2017, we submitted a letter in a non-party capacity to provide the USITC with information to inform its remedy recommendation. Thin-film solar cell products, such as our CdTe technology, are expressly excluded from the petition. However, it is unknown how the resolution of the petition, the scope or form of any resulting remedial action taken by the U.S. presidential administration, or any other U.S. or global trade remedies or other trade barriers, may directly or indirectly affect U.S. or global markets for solar energy and First Solar’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.""

**regarding their operations in Malaysia**

- ""The statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the United States is 35.0%, while the tax rates in Australia, India, and Malaysia are 30.0%, 34.6%, and 24.0%, respectively. In Malaysia, we have been granted a long-term tax holiday, scheduled to expire in 2027, pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in Malaysia is exempt from income tax.""

4v34n7_FSLR,FSLR,First Solar Earnings DD (FSLR),"The only solar company in the black has Earnings August 3rd AH at 4:30PM

Here's what I have so far

**Insiders**
Close to 1,000,000 shares given in July 21 to high ranking officials. All apart of a Performance Plan that rewards Directors and officers for meeting corporate targets/goals

**Historical Past Earnings**
FSLR is the only solar company that is doing ""well"" financially wise. They have $1.8B on hand with a long term governmet loan of about $250M. They have also beat their last 5 out of their last 6 earnings

**Market Reactions**
(Quater, Met status, % pps change)

* Q4 2014 Met +2.6%
* Q1 2015 Missed -3.6%
* Q2 2015 Met     +13%
* Q3 2015 Met     +12%
* Q4 2015 Met     +4%
* Q1 2016 Met     -5%

Something to note about Q1 2016 and Q4 2015 is that the whole solar industry itself was down. As of today every solar company besides FSLR is in the red including Solar City. Ironically SUN bankruptcy rumors were highest a 3-4 days before FSLR's earnings. Every Solar stock dropped with FSLR being the least affected at 4.3%.  It also didnt help that they missed the top line by 13%.

""If I were to invest in a solar company, FSLR would be the one I would invest in.
Positives
 It is one of the very few companies in the industry that has a positive net cash position, 3.6% of net sales goes into R&D which isn't too bad, growth isn't too aggressive or slow, the rest of the positives are included in the picture
Negatives 
There has been an earnings deficit within the past 10 years and it doesn't pay a dividend. Its also not trading near the grahams enterprising stock number but is trading under the book value.""

**Governments role**
FSLR is 30% owned by the Waltons (walmart) who also has the government by the balls
Government enforced tarrifs against china solar has made it lucrative for FSLR to operate with businesses getting essentially 30% off. But this is set to drop later next year so I assume FLSR has received an influx of orders for this year.

**Red Flags**
Some things to note

* SUN has again created solar instability by filing for bankruptcy late april. Though this is hopeful.
https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-sunedisons-bankruptcy-wont-deflate-solar-boom

* Their CEO is James Hughes, former President and CEO of Enron

* The cost of solar modules have dropped. To compensate FSLR has worked hard to drop their operating costs but Im unsure if thats enough.

They also have a yieldco CAFD that pays a ~~13-15% dividend to those interested.~~ dividend growth is targeted at 13-15% 

Personally Im $3k deep

It seems like they just had a major dip because of a cut back in Revenue, but the nature of their projects create ""lumpy"" cash flow anyway, so quarter to quarter growth is not a smooth line. Plus the solar tax credit was extended. It looks like fair value would be closer to $80.

In a sector full of losers, FSLR has a healthy balance sheet, good management, and a lot of work in its pipeline.  I have made some money trading on their volatility, but I feel like it is now time for them to begin an inexorable march back up and am contemplating taking a long position.  The thoughts, questions, concerns, and rabid insults of /r/investing would now be appreciated.
