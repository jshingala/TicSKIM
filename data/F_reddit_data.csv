I don’t have a mechanical strategy and feel like im going to blow my account at some point. 

I mostly buy gold because of fondamental plus technical I avoid trading news, feels like im pretty lucky for now. 

I manage to pass my first FTMO challenge and blew it right away 
Then I passed another one and I’m on my way to get my second payout if everything holds. 

What I’m asking is how do you guys trade gold or if you’ve been in my situation too where you have no idea what you doing, how do you overcome this what rules or tips/tricks. 

I don’t have a preferred time in the day but i usually stop trading after 2/3 trades in red

1kfli35_F,F,Ford suspends 2025 guidance amid $2.5 billion tariff impact,">DETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street’s first-quarter expectations, but suspended its 2025 financial guidance amid an expected $2.5 billion impact this year from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

>The Detroit automaker said it expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025.

>Ford cited “near-term risks, especially the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption impacting production” and the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S., among other potential impacts such as retaliatory tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance.

>The tariff impact is notably less than the $4 billion to $5 billion that General Motors said it expected to incur as a result of Trump’s tariffs, as Ford imports fewer vehicles than its crosstown rival. GM said it expected to offset at least 30% of those expenses.

Looks like Ford is not providing guidance for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.

1k6rz3c_PLTR,PLTR,How You Can Trade Stocks Right Now In This F****d Up Market,"This market is hard. If you are a new trader, I encourage you to practice with paper, even if you have traded relatively well last year or so.

I'm somewhat used to any market condition. It's something that you learn only by experience, and now we have a market that is unpredictable and incredibly unforgiving.

**Why?**

Because we, as traders, rely on *technical analysis*. But when news and events are thrown in the mix, the very thing we rely on becomes *less* important, and our levels of support/resistance are going to get crushed with any news right now.

**So how the \*\*\*\* do we trade this?**

I'm going to show you an example of yesterday, a few trades I took.

First things first.

Your stock pick has to be EXCELLENT in this market. It needs a clear DAILY breakout of any support/resistance, etc - yes, even when you're daytrading only.

You **find** stock on the daily chart (big caps) and you **trade** on the 15-minute chart. Don't swing in this environment. You also MUST look at $SPY and align your trades with it.

**Now, why is the daily chart important?**

In addition to the fact that institutions mainly use the daily chart, the support/resistance levels are more reliable.

Secondly, when you find a stock that is breaking out from a daily level (let's say a stock breaks resistance), **the stock will usually close at its high** \- **IF the market (SPY) is favorable**. All stocks follow SPY to a degree and they are going to be influenced by the direction of SPY.

This market is right now only good for day trading. Quickly in and quickly out.

So, we want to find these stock candidates from the daily chart, because we can jump in on a clean pullback intraday. In this case, we can:

*A. ride the stock to new highs from the pullback, or B. get out with minimal damage if the whole market goes down.*

(btw the same works for bearish stocks)

Okay, let's look at a trade I took yesterday in this mess. These are by no means great trades, but they rather show how I'm scraping profits in this bad market.

You are going to see my stock pick $PLTR, and the market $SPY side-by-side on a 15-minute chart. But first, why $PLTR?

The answer is in the daily chart.

https://preview.redd.it/16hopvzf3swe1.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=5be3fdb007573a13a17b7f69c65a972d9f900c4c

This doesn't need a lot of commentary. It broke horizontal resistance on the daily chart, and it had room to go up. Excellent candidate.

Remember, if you have a great daily breakout, the stock will, in most cases, close at its high if the market is favorable. So, I like to wait for a pullback intraday when I see a breakout like this, and trade off that.

Before we go see how it played out intraday, I just want to say that I don't ever trade the open, or chase. It may work some of the time, but my trading journal and business say that I'm better off waiting patiently for a pullback.

Here is $PLTR and $SPY side-by-side on the 15-minute chart. I took two trades and made money on both, which I also posted live for transparency.

I always look at $SPY at the same time, and I try to align my entries and exits with it. SPY is on the right side, and PLTR is on the left.

https://preview.redd.it/8b6822825swe1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe205da0206b9efeb8888bb499375fa90f24ed20

**(click on the picture if it's too blurry)**

Extra commentary:

If you have read my other posts, you already know that I like to use the 10-ema intraday to find entries. In this market, It has become even more important because as the market (SPY) is driven by news that comes out almost daily, I can protect myself and get out of a trade very fast.

My original thesis was that if $SPY can get back up again, I will have an excellent entry and because of $PLTR's daily breakout, it's most likely going to close near its high, meaning that I would have around $4 to the high of the day.

But as the day unfolded, you can see that wasn't the case. I still profited because I had a great entry with intraday support below -- and exited in sync with $SPY.

This is a tough market and I'm already getting exhausted trading this sh\*t, hopefully you can get something out of this and protect your account with this kind of approach.

You are going to need patience in this market. If you enter too early or too late, you're done.

Until next time.

Trade well.

  
EDIT: FYI: Trading is my full-time job. I post all my trades live with entries and exits instead of fake screenshots. This post was meant to help newer traders see how a day trader approaches this market. ",2025-04-24,94,104

(Reuters) -Ford Motor has halted shipments of its SUVs, pick-up trucks and sports cars to China in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company this week halted shipments of its F-150 Raptors, Mustangs and Michigan-built Bronco SUVs as well as Kentucky-made Lincoln Navigators to China, the report said.

China's retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. import taxes have seen these vehicles face a tariff as high as 150%.

The automaker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The development comes as U.S. automakers scramble to find ways to tackle Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, which are expected to dent profits of carmakers and parts suppliers likewise.

Ford also exports U.S.-built engines and transmissions to China, which the report says will continue despite the pause on exports of assembled vehicles.

Its Lincoln Nautilus model, which is manufactured in China, is also expected to have continued shipments, despite heavy tariffs, the report added.",2025-04-18,519,94

1jqqssm_PATH,PATH,$VFC V.F. Corp.  Entering Deep Value Territory.,"
At $4.57 Billion($11.73 price per share), this has become potentially the best apparel deal on the market.

A better deal than Nike, Estee Lauder, Canada Goose, and Lululemon.


VF Corporation is a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, footwear, and accessories.  Their main brands are The North Face, Vans, Timberland, and Dickies. 

First things first:

1. Bracken Darrell and Sun Choe

Bracken Darrell, appointed as President and CEO in July 2023, brings a wealth of experience in brand transformation and innovation. He helped save Old Spice in the late 2000s.  The Tickets Are Now Diamonds!  He also saved logitech in the 2010s.  Under his leadership, VFC has undertaken significant initiatives to streamline operations and enhance brand equity. ​  The beauty about Bracken is that when he promises to do a particular thing, you may as well price it in as 100% happening.  Ever since following him in Logitech, I’ve never seen him promise something and then waffle on it.

Under his leadership, Logitech’s market cap grew over 20x(peak to trough), and the company became known for strong DTC execution.  Something VFCorp lacks.

VF desperately needs a turnaround specialist with a consumer brand focus… and that’s Bracken’s sweet spot. 

Early signs are promising: He’s already begun restructuring and slimming down VF’s cost base while bringing in fresh leadership talent like Choe.  

In June 2024, VF appointed Sun Choe as the Global Brand President of Vans.

She used to be the  CPO at Lululemon, where she was the primary piece of the puzzle within product innovation and market expansion.   Hard to imagine 2 better picks.



2. Resilience Through Market Cycles

VF Corporation has a storied history of navigating various economic cycles and cyclical fashion trends. The company's diversified brand portfolio has enabled it to adapt and thrive amidst changing consumer preferences for decades. This resilience underscores VF's ability to sustain long-term growth and it gives me the comfort to ignore macroeconomic surroundings.

3. Financial Performance since Bracken came on board: Growth in EPS, Revenue, and Margins

Since Q1 2024, VF has demonstrated notable financial improvements:​

Revenue Growth: In Q2 2025, VF reported revenue of $2.76 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations and indicating a positive trajectory, despite conservative guidance. ​

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company achieved an adjusted EPS of $0.60 in the same quarter, reflecting effective cost management and operational efficiency. ​



Gross Margin Expansion: VF's gross margin improved by 120 basis points to 52.2%, attributed to strategic inventory management and a focus on selling products at full price. ​

For 4 quarters now, VF Corp has improved EPS, Revenue, and gross margins.  The big difference is we don’t have to pay as much because markets are giving us a chance to buy it much lower:

4. Strengthening Financial Position: 

Liability Reduction

VF has proactively addressed its financial leverage:​

Debt Management: The company has been on a leverage-reduction path since June 2023.  Cutting total debt from $11.3bn to $8.8bn.


5. Strategic Initiatives and Market Positioning

Beyond leadership and financial metrics, VF's commitment to innovation and market responsiveness is evident, especially in the hiring of Sun Choe.

Portfolio Optimization: The divestiture of non-core assets, such as the sale of the Occupational Workwear business and Supreme, allows VF to concentrate on its core brands, enhancing operational focus. ​


Direct-to-Consumer Emphasis: Increasing investment in direct-to-consumer channels aligns VF with current retail trends, fostering closer customer relationships and higher margins. ​



Potential Risks: 

Market Competition: The apparel and footwear industry is highly competitive.  VFC has a decent moat, but Nike is making a successful push for a piece of the skateboard market.  It’s tough to break-in to the apparel world, but it’s not as difficult for established competing brands to steal market share from one another.

Economic Sensitivity: As a consumer discretionary company, VF's performance is influenced by macroeconomic conditions that affect consumer spending.​  I don’t allow macroecon to dictate my decisions, but it is a real risk either way.


Execution Risks? I would say this is not a risk honestly.  Bracken Darrell will do what is necessary.  He has been consistent in his messaging.  He does what he says he will do, and it works as he says it will.  This has always been the case with him, and continues to be the case here.  


You can buy $10-$11bn in profitable operating leverage for $4.5bn today.  

In 2005 you could have paid $5.5bn for $5.6bn in revenue and gotten a 5 bagger over 10 years. 
At that price it compounded at 17.5%.  

At today’s price, I would expect much closer to 30-40% over the next 5 years.",2025-04-03,16,46

Execution Risks? I would say this is not a risk honestly.  Bracken Darrell will do what is necessary.  He has been consistent in his messaging.  He does what he says he will do, and it works as he says it will.  This has always been the case with him, and continues to be the case here.  


You can buy $10-$11bn in profitable operating leverage for $4.5bn today.

Who are they gonna tariff and at what rates? Like, the very basic questions haven’t been answered yet.”","Just days out from Trump’s April 2 announcement of global tariffs, which he has hailed as “Liberation Day,” even those closest to the president — from Vice President JD Vance to his chief of staff Susie Wiles and his own Cabinet officials — have privately indicated that they’re unsure exactly what the boss will do, according to three people who have spoken with them.

While some details of the administration’s plan for what Trump has dubbed “reciprocal tariffs” on global trading partners are starting to trickle out, the president has at times upended them or floated contradictory policies that are keeping everyone — even his inner circle — guessing.

“No one knows what the f*** is going on,” said one White House ally close to Trump’s inner circle, granted anonymity to speak freely. “What are they going to tariff? Who are they gonna tariff and at what rates? Like, the very basic questions haven’t been answered yet.”

Indeed, while the White House is projecting confidence publicly, multiple administration officials, as well as top allies on the outside, are privately concerned that next week’s roll-out could be as rocky as when he imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on March 4, worsening a rout on stocks that began in mid-February. Though the S&P 500 has since regained some ground, all of its previous gains since Election Day have been erased.

Case in point: Wednesday’s decision to slap the auto industry with 25 percent tariffs. While expected in some fashion in the near future, the announcement came together so last minute that the White House wasn’t fully prepared and had to delay afternoon programming as they sought to finalize the plan, according to two people familiar with the roll-out.

The White House also didn’t brief industry stakeholders in the U.S. or abroad beforehand — though a White House official argued that if they were “smart” they would have known it was coming, since Trump himself issued a public warning.

“I think it would be a mistake to think next week all of a sudden we’re going to get a bunch of clarity,” said Tom Graff, chief investment officer at financial advisory firm Facet. “I’m sure they’re trying to reset with financial markets and build some certainty, but I don’t think the president is going to have a personality transplant.”

“I think he wants to keep his options open,” Graff added.

In a series of statements, the White House and the various Cabinet heads said the administration is working together to implement Trump’s vision. “As the movie ‘Drumline’ goes, ‘one band, one sound,’” White House senior adviser for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said in a statement.

“We are the greatest economic team and April 2nd will be a historic day for American workers,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.

“We may have sectoral tariffs on April 2, and we may not,” a White House official, granted anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations, said Monday. “No final decisions have been made yet on sectoral tariffs being tacked onto” the reciprocal tariff announcement next week.

Needless to say, the president’s shifting desires have made it difficult to plan, as Cabinet officials have indicated in private. In recent days, Lutnick told U.S. trading partners seeking clarity that he would try to give them a heads up the day before April 2, telling them that the details are too fluid at the moment to preview. Bessent has also admitted to people that the final tariff regime remains a moving target, according to a person who has spoken to him.

The divisions have caused tensions. While Navarro is a genuine tariff believer, Lutnick — who has a close relationship with Trump and enjoys influence that others in the Cabinet do not, as of yet — is widely seen as supporting whatever Trump wants to ingratiate himself with the president, a dynamic that has infuriated others in the administration.

“He goes into the Oval and tells the president whatever he wants to hear,” said the first White House ally, who called Lutnick a “f***ing nightmare” and argued he does so without consideration of the economic consequences.

Over the past few weeks, the more tariff-cautious faction in the administration has tried gently to pull Trump back from blanket, indiscriminate tariffs.

“I don’t think it’s like no one wants to tell Trump the bad, the hard news,” said one of the outside allies mentioned above. “I think people have tried to have a conversation with him, and he’s dead set on it. He’s a true believer.”

AN HOUR WITH MR. GRAHAM

by Hartman L. Butler, Jr., C.F.A.

La Jolla, California



March 6, 1976 



HB:      Mr. Graham, I do appreciate so much being able to come and visit with you this afternoon. When Bob Milne learned that Mrs. Butler and I would be in La Jolla, he suggested that I not only visit with you but also bring along my cassette tape recorder. We have much I would like to cover. First, could we start with a topical question—Government Employees Insurance Company—with GEICO being very much in the headlines. 



Graham: Yes, what happened was the team came into our office and after some negotiating, we bought half the company for $720,000. It turned out later that we were worth—the whole company—over a billion dollars in the stock market. This was a very extraordinary thing. But we were forced by the SEC to distribute the stock among our stockholders because, according to a technicality in the law, an investment fund was not allowed more than 10 percent of an insurance company. Jerry Newman and I became active in the conduct of GEICO, although we both retired a number of years ago. I am glad I am not connected with it now because of the terrific losses. 



HB:      Do you think GEICO will survive? 



Graham: Yes, I think it will survive. There is no basic reason why it won’t survive, but naturally I ask myself whether the company did expand much too fast without taking into account the possibilities of these big losses. It makes me shudder to think of the amounts of money they were able to lose in one year. Incredible! It is surprising how many of the large companies have managed to turn in losses of $50 million or $100 million in one year, in these last few years. Something unheard of in the old days. You have to be a genius to lose that much money. 



HB:      Looking back at your own life in the investment field, what are some of the key developments or key happenings, would you say? You went to Wall Street in 1914? 



Graham: Well, the first thing that happened was typical. As a special favor, I was paid $12 a week instead of $10 to begin. The next thing that happened was World War I broke out two months later and the stock exchange was closed. My salary was reduced to $10—that is one of the things more or less typical of any young man’s beginnings. The next thing that was really important to me—outside of having made a rather continuous success for 15 years—was the market crash of 1929. 



HB:      Did you see that coming at all—were you scared? 



Graham: No. All I knew was that prices were too high. I stayed away from the speculative favorites. I felt I had good investments. But I owed money, which was a mistake, and I had to sweat through the period 1929-1932. I didn’t repeat that error after that. 



HB:      Did anybody really see this coming—the crash of 1929? 



Graham: Babson did, but he started selling five years earlier. 



HB:      Then in 1932, you began to come back? 



Graham: Well, we sweated through that period. By 1937, we had restored our financial position as it was in 1929. From then on, we went along pretty smoothly. 



HB:      The 1937-1938 decline, were you better prepared for that? 



Graham: Well, that led us to make some changes in our procedures that one of our directors had suggested to us, which was sound, and we followed his advice. We gave up certain things we had been trying to do and concentrated more on others that had been more consistently successful. We went along fine. In 1948, we made our GEICO investment and from then on, we seemed to be very brilliant people. 



HB:      What happened in the only other interim bear market—1940-1941? 



Graham: Oh, that was only a typical setback period. We earned money in those years. 



HB:      You earned money after World War II broke out? 



Graham: Yes, we did. We had no real problems in running our business. That’s why I kind of lost interest. We were no longer very challenged after 1950. About 1956, I decided to quit and to come out here to California to live. I felt that I had established a way of doing business to a point where it no longer presented any basic problems to be solved. We were going along on what I thought was a satisfactory basis, and the things that presented themselves were typically repetitions of old problems which I found no special interest in solving. About six years later, we decided to liquidate Graham-Newman Corporation—to end it primarily because the succession of management had not been satisfactorily established. We felt we had nothing special to look forward to that interested us. We could have built up an enormous business had we wanted to, but we limited ourselves to a maximum of $15 million of capital—only a drop in the bucket these days. The question of whether we could earn the maximum percentage per year was what interested us. It was not the question of total sums, but annual rates of return that we were able to accomplish. 



HB:      When did you decide to write your classic text, Security Analysis? 



Graham: What happened was that in about 1925, I thought that I knew enough about Wall Street after 11 years to write a book about it. But fortunately, I had the inspiration instead to learn more on the subject before I wrote the book, so I decided I would start teaching if I could. I became a Lecturer at the Columbia School of Business for the extension courses. In 1928, we had a course in security analysis and finance—I think it was called Investments—and I had 150 students. That was the time Wall Street was really booming. The result was it took until 1934 before I actually wrote the book with Dave Dodd. He was a student of mine in the first year. Dave was then Assistant Professor at Columbia and was anxious to learn more. Naturally, he was indispensable to me in writing the book. The First Edition appeared in 1934. Actually, it came out the same time as a play of mine which was produced on Broadway and lasted only one week. 



HB:      You had a play on Broadway? 



Graham: Yes. “Baby Pompadour” or “True to the Marines.” It was produced twice under two titles. It was not successful. Fortunately, Security Analysis was much more successful. 



HB:      That was the book, wasn’t it? 



Graham: They called it the “Bible of Graham and Dodd.” Yes, well now I have lost most of the interest I had in the details of security analysis which I devoted myself to so strenuously for many years. I feel that they are relatively unimportant, which, in a sense, has put me opposed to developments in the whole profession. I think we can do it successfully with a few techniques and simple principles.



The main point is to have the right general principles and the character to stick to them. 



HB:      My own experience is that you have to be a student of industries to realize the great differences in managements. I think that this is one thing an analyst can bring to the solution. 



Graham: Well, I would not deny that. But I have a considerable amount of doubt on the question of how successful analysts can be overall when applying these selectivity approaches. The thing that I have been emphasizing in my own work for the last few years has been the group approach. To try to buy groups of stocks that meet some simple criterion for being undervalued—regardless of the industry and with very little attention to the individual company. My recent article on three simple methods applied to common stocks was published in one of your Seminar Proceedings. I am just finishing a 50-year study—the application of these simple methods to groups of stocks, actually, to all the stocks in the Moody’s Industrial Stock Group. I found the results were very good for 50 years. They certainly did twice as well as the Dow Jones. And so my enthusiasm has been transferred from the selective to the group approach. What I want is an earnings ratio twice as good as the bond interest ratio typically for most years. One can also apply a dividend criterion or an asset value criterion and get good results. My research indicates the best results come from simple earnings criterions. 



HB:      I have always thought it was too bad that we use the price/earnings ratio rather than the earnings yield measurement. It would be so much easier to realize that a stock is selling at a 2.5 percent earnings yield rather than 40 times earnings. 



Graham: Yes. The earnings yield would be more scientific and a more logical approach. 



HB:      Then with roughly a 50 percent dividend payout, you can take half of the earnings yield to estimate a substainable dividend yield. 



Graham: Yes. Basically, I want to double the interest rate in terms of earnings return. However, in most years the interest rate was less than five percent on AAA bonds. Consequently, I have set two limits. A maximum multiple of 10 even when interest rates are under five percent, and a maximum multiple of 7 times even when interest rates are above seven percent as they are now. So typically my buying point would be double the current AAA interest rate with a maximum multiplier between 10 and 7. My research has been based on that. I received in Chicago last year the Molodovsky Award. 



HB:      I understand that you have about completed this research. 



Graham: Imagine—there seems to be practically a foolproof way of getting good results out of common stock investment with a minimum of work. It seems too good to be true. But all I can tell you after 60 years of experience, it seems to stand up under any of the tests that I would make up. I would try to get other people to criticize it. 



HB:      By some coincidence as you were becoming less active as a writer, a number of professors started to work on the random walk. What do you think about this? 



Graham: Well, I am sure they are all very hardworking and serious. It’s hard for me to find a good connection between what they do and practical investment results. In fact, they say that the market is efficient in the sense that there is no particular point in getting more information than people already have. That might be true, but the idea of saying that the fact that the information is so widely spread that the resulting prices are logical prices—that is all wrong. I don’t see how you can say that the prices made in Wall Street are the right prices in any intelligent definition of what right prices would be. 



HB:      It is too bad there have not been more contributions from practicing analysts to provide some balance to the brilliant work of the academic community. 



Graham: Well, when we talk about buying stocks, as I do, I am talking very practically in terms of dollars and cents, profits and losses, mainly profits. I would say that if a stock with $50 working capital sells at $32, that would be an interesting stock. If you buy 30 companies of that sort, you’re bound to make money. You can’t lose when you do that. There are two questions about this approach. One is, am I right in saying if you buy stocks at two-thirds of the working capital value, you have a dependable indication of group undervaluation? That’s what our own business experience proved to us. The second question, are there other ways of doing this? 



HB:      Are there any other ways? 



Graham: Well, naturally, the thing that I have been talking about so much this afternoon is applying a simple criterion of the value of a security. But what everybody else is trying to do pretty much is pick out the “Xerox” companies, the “3M’s”, because of their long-term futures or to decide that next year the semiconductor industry would be a good industry. These don’t seem to be dependable ways to do it. There are certainly a lot of ways to keep busy. 



HB:      Would you have said that 30 years ago? 



Graham: Well, no, I would not have taken as negative an attitude 30 years ago. But my positive attitude would have been to say, rather, that you could have found sufficient examples of individual companies that were undervalued. 



HB:      The efficient market people have kind of muddied the waters, haven’t they, in a way?



Graham: Well, they would claim that if they are correct in their basic contentions about the efficient market, the thing for people to do is to try to study the behavior of stock prices and try to profit from these interpretations. To me, that is not a very encouraging conclusion because if I have noticed anything over these 60 years on Wall Street, it is that people do not succeed in forecasting what’s going to happen to the stock market. 



HB:      That is certainly true. 



Graham: And all you have to do is to listen to “Wall Street Week” and you can see that none of them has any particular claim to authority or opinions as to what will happen in the stock market. They, and economists, all have opinions and they are willing to express them if you ask them. But I don’t think they insist that their opinions are correct, though. 



HB:      What thoughts do you have on index funds? 



Graham: I have very definite views on that. I have a feeling that the way in which institutional funds should be managed, at least a number of them, would be to start with the index concept—the equivalent of index results, say 100 or 150 stocks out of the Standard & Poor’s 500. Then turn over to managers the privilege of making a variation, provided they would accept personal responsibility for the success of the variation that they introduced. I assume that basically the compensation ought to be measured by the results either in terms of equaling the index, say Standard & Poor’s results, or to the extent by which you improve it. Now in the group discussions of this thing, the typical money managers don’t accept the idea and the reason for non-acceptance is chiefly that they say—not that it isn’t practical—but that it isn’t sound because different investors have different requirements. They have never been able to convince me that that’s true in any significant degree—that different investors have different requirements. All investments require satisfactory results, and I think satisfactory results are pretty much the same for everybody. So I think any experience of the last 20 years, let’s say, would indicate that one could have done as well with Standard & Poor’s than with a great deal of work, intelligence, and talk. 



HB:      Mr. Graham, what advice would you have to a young man or woman coming along now who wants to be a security analyst and a Chartered Financial Analyst? 



Graham: I would tell them to study the past record of the stock market, study their own capabilities, and find out whether they can identify an approach to investment they feel would be satisfactory in their own case. And if they have done that, pursue that without any reference to what other people do or think or say. Stick to their own methods. That’s what we did with our own business.



We never followed the crowd, and I think that’s favorable for the young analyst. If he or she reads The Intelligent Investor—which I feel would be more useful than Security Analysis of the two books—and selects from what we say some approach which one thinks would be profitable, then I say that one should do this and stick to it. I had a nephew who started in Wall Street a number of years ago and came to me for some advice. I said to him, “Dick, I have some practical advice to give you which is this. You can buy closed-end investment companies at 15 percent discounts on an average. Get your friends to put “x” amount of dollars a month in these closed-end companies at discounts and you will start ahead of the game and you will make out all right.” Well, he did do that—he had no great difficulty in starting his business on that basis. It did work out all right and then the big bull market came along and, of course, he moved over to other fields and did an enormous amount of speculative business later. But at least he started, I think, on a sound basis. And if you start on a sound basis, you are half-way along.



HB:      Do you think that Wall Street or the typical analyst or portfolio managers have learned their lessons of the “Go-Go” funds, the growth cult, the one-decision stocks, the two-tier market, and all?



Graham: No. They used to say about the Bourbons that they forgot nothing and they learned nothing, and I'll say about the Wall Street people, typically, is that they learn noth-ing, and they forget everything. I have no confidence whatever in the future behavior of the Wall Street people. I think this business of greed-the excessive hopes and fears and so on—will be with us as long as there will be people. There is a famous passage in Bagehot, the English economist, in which he describes how panics come about. Typically, if people have money, it is available to be lost and they speculate with it and they lose it-that's how panics are done. I am very cynical about Wall Street.



HB: But there are independent thinkers on Wall Street and throughout the country who do well, aren't there?



Graham: Yes. There are two requirements for success in Wall Street. One, you have to think correctly; and secondly, you have to think independently.



HB: Yes, correctly and independently. The sun is trying to come out now, literally, here in La Jolla. What do you see of the sunshine on Wall Street?



Graham: Well, there has been plenty of sunshine since the middle of 1974 when the bottom of the market was reached. And my guess is that Wall Street hasn't changed at all. The present optimism is going to be overdone, and the next pessimism will be overdone, and you are back on the Ferris Wheel-whatever you want to call it-Seesaw, Merry-Go-Round. You will be back on that. Right now, stocks as a whole are not overvalued, in my opinion. But nobody seems concerned with what are the possibilities that 1970 and 1973-1974 will be duplicated in the next five years. Apparently, nobody has given any thought to that ques-tion. But that such experiences will be duplicated in the next five years or so, you can bet your Dow Jones Average on that.

HB:

This has been a most pleasant and stimulative visit. We will look forward to receiving in Charlottesville your memoirs manuscript. Thank you so much, Mr. Graham!

1ijej1v_F,F,"E.l.f. stock tanks after retailer cuts guidance, citing ‘soft’ January amid TikTok saga and LA wildfires","E.l.f. Beauty on Thursday cut its full-year guidance after seeing a 36% drop in profits and “softer than expected” sales trends in January, marking a rare downturn for one of beauty’s hottest brands. 

The cosmetics company reported holiday sales that were higher than expected but profits that narrowly missed estimates, another rare miss for the retailer. 

Shares of E.l.f. fell more than 20% in extended trading Thursday.

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 74 cents adjusted vs. 75 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $355 million vs. $330 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Dec. 31 was $17.3 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with $26.9 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, including stock-based compensation and expenses associated with its acquisition of Naturium, E.l.f. posted adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $355 million, up about 31% from $271 million a year earlier.

For the company’s full fiscal year, which only has one quarter remaining, E.l.f. issued guidance that came in below Wall Street expectations. The retailer is now expecting sales of between $1.3 billion and $1.31 billion, below estimates of $1.34 billion, according to StreetAccount. It had previously expected sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion. 

E.l.f. is also now expecting adjusted earnings per share of between $3.27 and $3.32, far below StreetAccount estimates of $3.54. E.l.f. had previously expected full-year earnings of between $3.47 and $3.53. 

The company’s implied guidance for its current quarter looks even rougher. Based on its full-year outlook and actual figures from the first three quarters, E.l.f. could see earnings per share of between 66 cents and 71 cents during its current quarter, far below expectations of 97 cents, according to a CNBC analysis and estimates from LSEG. 

In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tarang Amin shrugged off concerns that there were larger issues at the company and instead pointed to an overall slowdown in the beauty category, tough prior-year comparisons and recent product launches that didn’t perform as well as previous new items. 

When it comes to the overall category, Amin said mass cosmetics declined by 5% in January and the company suspects that was driven by two factors: a hangover from holiday discounting and a slowdown in “social commentary,” or fewer people talking about beauty online, which can drive cosmetics sales. 

“One, \[with\] the LA wildfires, people I think didn’t want to be tone deaf with posting a lot of things while that devastation went on. The second is, there was a lot of uncertainty around TikTok. I feel like the only things people were posting on Tiktok was whether it was going to stay open or shut down,” explained Amin. “Whatever the reason may be, that social commentary was way down.”

Amin also weighed in on new tariffs against China and how the company is preparing. About 80% of its supply chain is in the region.

Amin said it’s too early to say whether E.l.f. will raise prices to offset the impact to profits, but the new 10% duties are better than what the company was bracing for.

Over the last couple of years, E.l.f. has been one of the fastest growing brands in beauty, winning over shoppers young and old with its viral marketing, low prices and ability to offer high-quality, more-affordable “dupes” of prestige products.

While the brand is still growing and says it is still outpacing the overall category, that pace of growth is starting to slow down and recent product launches haven’t boosted sales in the same way they did in the past. 

Amin said the company prefers to take a “prudent” approach to guidance and still considers it a win that E.l.f. is outperforming the overall category.

He said the company is using the profits it generates to invest in improvements to inventory management programs, infrastructure and international expansion.

1ihj822_F,F,ESSO S.A.F.,"One more time I have bought into Esso SAF (you can see the original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/13pu9zs/esso\_saf\_french\_refinery\_and\_oil\_stations\_selling/).

Last time I made over 120% on the stock so why am I coming back? The situation in the company developed again and I believe there is another possibility to make some good money.

Originally was Esso SAF French refinery business with two main refinery sites. The company is majority owned by Exxon and is traded in Paris stock exchange. Last year, one of the refinery plants was sold to third party for 130m$ and the acquirer is also buying approximately 400m$ worth of stock (basically crude oil) and some payables are being transferred as well, approx 60m$. So lets say that the total would be 600m$.

Before the sale, Esso had 1.1B Euro of cash, 1.9B of inventory (crude oil and similar), receivables and other assets say another 1B. So in total 4B, total payables 2.6B, so the value of the assets which are basically cash and crude oil minus all liabilities is 1.4B. Current market capitalization of the company is 1.4B as well.

Taking into account the sale of the refinery the current assets would be 1.7B in cash, 1.5B in inventory and other assets, with liabilities going down.

So you are basically getting the other refinery in Gravenchon for free. Refinery is not most popular business now but it is still reasonably profitable (130m profit for first quarter of this financial year). Company also agreed to close some old chemical activities which should save some 100m Euro a year. The refinery margins are going down yet they are still higher than in 2017 and 2018, when the company was still profitable.

Why do I think this opportunity exist? First of all, 84% of the company is owned by Exxon, so forget about activist investing. Secondly, the refinery business in general is being hammered, but Gravenchon still represents 20% of French refinery output. I dont see that coming away soon. Thirdly, the reporting is limited. Only twice a year, first after first three months and than after whole year.",2025-02-04,2,5

Trading at 1/5 of peer value. CEO traded his private jet for shares. Shorts are about to learn what federal preemption means.**

**THE SABLE ORIGIN STORY** 📚 Picture this: It's 2021, and some absolute chads see something in California that would make Michael Burry proud. They look at the most anti-oil state in America and say ""let's buy Exxon's shutdown oil fields.""

**What They Bought:**

* Santa Ynez Unit: Three massive offshore platforms

* Pipelines that gave California PTSD in 2015
* Previous production: 671 MILLION barrels (1981-2015)

* Must restart production by January 2026
* If they fail, Exxon can take it back

**THE NUCLEAR BOMB TRUMP JUST DROPPED 💣 Yesterday, Trump signed the most aggressive energy executive order I've ever seen. This isn't your regular ""save the polar bears"" BS. This is the federal government going full send on California regulators.**

Just when you thought this setup couldn't get any more interesting, **Phil fucking Mickelson** is in the stock too.

\--

Listen up degenerates, because I've found something so beautiful it would make Michael Burry cry. This isn't your regular oil moonshot - this is the kind of deep value play that usually gets snatched up by Private Equity before retail ever sees it.

First, let me explain what the fuck SOC even is, because this backstory is important. Back in 2021, a group of oil industry veterans pulled off what might be the biggest chad move in energy: they bought ExxonMobil's shutdown California oil fields for pocket change. Not some speculative drilling rights - we're talking about three massive offshore platforms that were pumping 671 MILLION barrels of oil from 1981 to 2015.

Why did these money printers stop? In 2015, one of their pipelines had an oopsie that made California regulators lose their minds. Everything got shut down, and Exxon, tired of dealing with California's bs, basically said ""fuck it"" and sold the whole thing to these guys who became Sable Offshore. They gave them a loan, and said here you go.

Here's where it gets interesting. The deal was structured like a 4D chess move: Sable got the assets for almost nothing upfront, BUT they have to restart production by January 2026 or Exxon can take everything back. Everyone thought they were fucked because California's regulatory process moves slower than your wife's boyfriend on date night.

But yesterday, something magical happened. **Trump signed an executive order** that's basically a tactical nuke aimed directly at California regulators. And this isn't your regular executive order about protecting endangered snails - this is the federal government going full ""fuck your permits"" mode.

**Let me explain why this order changes everything. When Trump declared a national energy emergency yesterday, he didn't just sign some weak 'pretty please approve permits faster' bullshit. He activated three specific legal powers that turn SOC from 'maybe someday' to 'holy shit this is happening':**

1. **The Defense Production Act** \- If you don't know what this is, it's the same law they used to force companies to make ventilators during COVID. Except now, instead of ventilators, they're saying SOC's oil is critical to national defense. Think about that. Once your oil field becomes a military strategic asset, California's permits become as relevant as your wife's boyfriend's opinion on your investment strategy.
2. **Federal Preemption Powers** \- The order specifically calls out California's ""dangerous State and local policies"" as a threat to national security. This isn't just fancy legal talk. Remember the Millennium Pipeline case in 2006? New York tried to block a natural gas pipeline, and the feds just said ""nah"" and built it anyway. This order gives SOC the same power, but on steroids because now it's a declared national emergency.
3. **Military Construction Authority** \- This is the cherry on top. The order lets the Department of Defense declare infrastructure as critical to national security. Once that happens, SOC's pipelines aren't oil pipelines anymore - they're strategic defense assets. Game over.

But here's where it gets really spicy. While the market is still trying to figure out what this means, the CEO, Jim Flores, already showed us he knows exactly what's coming. In October, this absolute chad traded his private jet - yes, his PRIVATE JET - for 600,000 more shares. When's the last time you saw a CEO give up his jet to buy more stock? This isn't some bullshit insider buying where they grab a few shares for show. This is ""I believe in this so much I'll fly Spirit Airlines"" level conviction.

**Now let's talk numbers, because this is where your smooth brain might actually form a wrinkle. SOC is currently trading at $26, which values their oil at $4.87 per barrel. Meanwhile, every other comparable company trades at $26 per barrel. For you math-challenged apes, that means SOC is trading at ONE-FIFTH of what it should be worth, just because some California bureaucrats are mad.**

But wait, it gets better. **There are 7,080,000 shares short**. The same smooth brains who thought betting against American oil during a national energy emergency was a good idea. Meanwhile, insiders own 14.30% and institutions own 26.19% of the float. And these aren't day-trading paper hands - these are long-term holders who actually read 10-Ks and understand what's about to happen.

Let me explain why the courts don't matter here, because this is where the genius of SOC's position comes in. The executive order isn't just some vague policy statement - it creates immediate emergency powers that work NOW, while any legal challenges would take years to resolve. By the time any court case gets serious, the oil will already be flowing.

Think about how the timeline works: SOC has until January 2026 to restart production. Court cases about federal emergency powers typically take 2-3 years minimum to reach any serious resolution. You see where this is going? The feds can start overriding California tomorrow, and by the time any judge gets involved, SOC will already be printing money.

And this isn't even considering the national security angle. **Courts have historically bent the knee when it comes to national security declarations**. The executive order specifically frames California's regulatory system as a threat to national security.

**But here's the part that makes this a truly asymmetric bet: SOC doesn't even need to win every regulatory fight. They just need to get their existing infrastructure back online. We're not talking about building new oil platforms here. Everything already exists - the platforms, the processing facility, the pipelines. They just need to fix some pipes and flip the switch.**

Let's talk about how fucking stupid the current valuation is. SOC is sitting on 646 MILLION barrels of oil. At current prices around $80/barrel, that's $51.7 BILLION worth of oil. Yet the entire company is valued at $2.33B. Yes, you read that right. The market is pricing this like the oil will never flow.

'But what if oil prices drop?' Even at $40/barrel, this thing prints money. The infrastructure is already built. The wells are already drilled. This isn't some speculative play where they need to find oil - they already have it. They just need regulatory permission to turn it back on.

**Now let's talk about the short squeeze potential, because it's juicier than your wife's boyfriend's gains. There are 7,080,000 shares short. These 🤡 are literally betting that:**

1. The federal government won't enforce its own emergency order
2. California will successfully fight the Defense Production Act
3. Courts will move faster than SOC's restart timeline
4. The CEO traded his private jet for shares because he's stupid

Here's why the shorts are about to learn about federal preemption the hard way: The executive order requires agencies to report on their emergency actions every 30 days. That means we're about to get a constant stream of catalysts as federal agencies start steamrolling state regulators.

**Risk/Reward? Let's break it down:** Downside: SOC completely fumbles the greatest regulatory gift in history and loses everything to Exxon in 2026. You lose your investment but keep a great story about that time the President declared a national emergency to help a stock you owned.

**Upside:** SOC uses federal power to restart production, trades up to peer valuations (5x), and potentially squeezes higher as shorts realize they bet against oil during an energy emergency.

**Positions or Ban:** Balls deep with 6000 shares, and more options in my wife's account.

\-

\*Not financial advice. I just think when the President declares your regulatory problems a national emergency, something interesting might happen to your stock price.

P.S.: Yes, these are REAL oil fields that were ACTUALLY producing until 2015. This isn't some penny stock scam. This is boomer-grade assets with WSB-grade catalysts.

P.S.: For those asking about precedent - Secretary of Commerce overrode state objections in Millennium Pipeline case. This executive order is that case on steroids.

EDIT FORGOT TO MENTION.

**LA'S RECONSTRUCTION: WHY OIL DEMAND IS ABOUT TO GO PARABOLIC**

Rebuilding 12,300 destroyed structures is about to create massive oil demand that nobody's pricing in yet. This isn't just about construction - it's about the entire supply chain of rebuilding a major city.

**Think about what reconstruction requires: Diesel for thousands of construction vehicles and heavy equipment. Every bulldozer, crane, and dump truck runs on diesel. They'll be running 24/7 for months or years**.

Asphalt for roads and driveways that melted or got destroyed by heavy equipment. Asphalt is literally made from oil. Those 12,300 structures? Each one needs new access roads and driveways.

Plastics for everything from new plumbing to electrical conduits to insulation. Modern construction is basically impossible without petroleum products. Each rebuilt house needs thousands of pounds of plastic materials.

Transportation fuel for bringing in construction materials. Everything from lumber to steel to concrete has to be trucked in. The supply chain impact is massive.

Here's why this matters for SOC: California refineries are already running full tilt importing oil by tanker from overseas. Now they need to supply fuel for the biggest reconstruction effort in state history. And guess what sits idle just off their coast? **SOC's platforms that could supply that oil under U.S. environmental standards instead of importing it from Saudi Arabia.**

**The market hasn't priced this in yet because everyone's focused on the destruction rather than the reconstruction. But Trump's team gets it - that's why the executive order specifically targets West Coast energy infrastructure. They understand that rebuilding LA requires energy security.**

'But what if oil prices drop?' Even at $40/barrel, this thing prints money. The infrastructure is already built. The wells are already drilled. This isn't some speculative play where they need to find oil - they already have it. They just need regulatory permission to turn it back on.

**Now let's talk about the short squeeze potential, because it's juicier than your wife's boyfriend's gains. There are 7,080,000 shares short. These 🤡 are literally betting that:**

1. The federal government won't enforce its own emergency order
2. California will successfully fight the Defense Production Act
3. Courts will move faster than SOC's restart timeline
4. The CEO traded his private jet for shares because he's stupid

Here's why the shorts are about to learn about federal preemption the hard way: The executive order requires agencies to report on their emergency actions every 30 days. That means we're about to get a constant stream of catalysts as federal agencies start steamrolling state regulators.

**Risk/Reward? Let's break it down:** Downside: SOC completely fumbles the greatest regulatory gift in history and loses everything to Exxon in 2026. You lose your investment but keep a great story about that time the President declared a national emergency to help a stock you owned.

**Upside:** SOC uses federal power to restart production, trades up to peer valuations (5x), and potentially squeezes higher as shorts realize they bet against oil during an energy emergency.

**Positions or Ban:** Balls deep with 6000 shares, and more options in my wife's account.

\*Not financial advice. I just think when the President declares your regulatory problems a national emergency, something interesting might happen to your stock price.

P.S.: Yes, these are REAL oil fields that were ACTUALLY producing until 2015. This isn't some penny stock scam. This is boomer-grade assets with WSB-grade catalysts.

P.S.: For those asking about precedent - Secretary of Commerce overrode state objections in Millennium Pipeline case. This executive order is that case on steroids.

EDIT FORGOT TO MENTION.

**LA'S RECONSTRUCTION: WHY OIL DEMAND IS ABOUT TO GO PARABOLIC**

Rebuilding 12,300 destroyed structures is about to create massive oil demand that nobody's pricing in yet. This isn't just about construction - it's about the entire supply chain of rebuilding a major city.

**Think about what reconstruction requires: Diesel for thousands of construction vehicles and heavy equipment. Every bulldozer, crane, and dump truck runs on diesel. They'll be running 24/7 for months or years**.

Asphalt for roads and driveways that melted or got destroyed by heavy equipment. Asphalt is literally made from oil. Those 12,300 structures? Each one needs new access roads and driveways.

Plastics for everything from new plumbing to electrical conduits to insulation. Modern construction is basically impossible without petroleum products. Each rebuilt house needs thousands of pounds of plastic materials.

Transportation fuel for bringing in construction materials. Everything from lumber to steel to concrete has to be trucked in. The supply chain impact is massive.

Here's why this matters for SOC: California refineries are already running full tilt importing oil by tanker from overseas. Now they need to supply fuel for the biggest reconstruction effort in state history. And guess what sits idle just off their coast? **SOC's platforms that could supply that oil under U.S. environmental standards instead of importing it from Saudi Arabia.**

**The market hasn't priced this in yet because everyone's focused on the destruction rather than the reconstruction. But Trump's team gets it - that's why the executive order specifically targets West Coast energy infrastructure. They understand that rebuilding LA requires energy security.**

1i0j91l_NET,NET,"If I can afford the short-term losses, would renting my home for a small loss every month and have renters pay the majority of my mortgage be financially beneficial?","My friend and I have been constantly arguing over the last two years.

I own a small home. The mortgage is $2200 a month - I can rent out my home at a reasonable $2000 a month. I have $4000 set aside, already saved for incidentals during renting, and will be accounting for the $200 deficit and will add $150 every month for a maintenance fund. Additionally, I have a financial buffer in stocks which if everything went wrong, I could reallocate some of my investments to float for at least a year.

I plan to buy a new modest home and live there while allowing renters to help pay my mortgage on this current home, but I'm aware that I will NOT be MAKING money in the short term. However, at $150,000 a year salary, I know I can afford to lose some money in the short term. 

My argument is, that if you view the house as an asset, and the mortgage as a debt and NOT as a business venture, then yes, I'm losing money in short term, but if I liquidated the home at any time, then I would get the payday of the money which renters have been paying. My NET worth is actually rising, and benefitting, even though I'm allowing my CURRENT liquidity to suffer. 

What does r/investing think of this?


edit: for the record, my house has appreciated to the point that I WILL be renting it for more than the mortgage, so this is moot in reality. But pragmatically, I feel my strategy of taking a loss is still valid.",2025-01-13,19,80

1h157m6_F,F,Will the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Hurt or Help My Biotech Stocks?,"Biotech has been a bright spot in 2024, delivering innovation and strong performance that have fueled my enthusiasm for the sector. Looking ahead to 2025, I remain optimistic about biotech's potential to continue thriving, driven by advancements in cutting-edge therapies and a growing focus on healthcare innovation. However, optimism alone isn’t enough in the face of potential challenges. The recent nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services introduces uncertainty, with proposed policies that could disrupt vaccine initiatives, research funding, and regulatory practices. With these factors in mind, I want to highlight some of my favorite biotech stocks and then dive deeper into some potential positives and concerns going into this new administration in 2025.

**Biotech Spotlight #1: $OSTX**OS Therapies Inc. is a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing treatments for osteosarcoma and other solid tumors. Their innovative pipeline, robust funding, and partnerships make them a standout in oncology therapeutics.

Lead Candidate - OST-HER2:

* Phase 2b trial targeting HER2-positive osteosarcoma patients.
* Utilizes a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) vector to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells.

Tunable Drug Conjugate (TDC) Platform:

* Targets folate receptor-α expressing ovarian cancer.
* Potential applications in additional solid tumors.

Strong Financial and Operational Foundation:

* Secured $46 million in funding to advance OST-HER2 and OST-TDC.
* Established partnerships for manufacturing and development.

Market Potential:

* Low float of 1.6 million shares creates scarcity value.
* Focus on unmet medical needs in pediatric and adult populations.

**Biotech Spotlight #2: $CTXR**

Citius Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class critical care products. Their diversified pipeline includes:

* LYMPHIR™ (denileukin diftitox-cxdl): FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Commercialization efforts are underway to make this therapy available to patients. 
* Mino-Lok®: An antibiotic lock solution for catheter-related bloodstream infections. A Phase 3 trial demonstrated that catheter failure occurred significantly later in patients treated with Mino-Lok compared to those receiving a clinician-directed anti-infective lock solution. 
* Stem Cell Platform: Developing induced mesenchymal stem cells (i-MSCs) for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions. 

Now, let’s start with the challenges for the biotech industry with new administration**Potential Challenges:**

* Leadership Appointments: The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, as Secretary of Health and Human Services has raised concerns about potential shifts in public health policies. Such changes could impact vaccine development and approval processes, introducing uncertainty for biotech companies involved in vaccine research.
   * Vaccine Policy Overhaul: Kennedy plans to reassess vaccine safety, reduce access, and alter federal guidelines.
   * Agency Reforms: Proposes restructuring the CDC and FDA, cutting departments, and limiting pharmaceutical advertising.
   * Alternative Medicine Focus: Redirecting NIH funds toward holistic and alternative treatments.

**Potential Benefits:**

* Regulatory Environment: Trump's administration is expected to continue prioritizing deregulation, which could expedite drug approvals and foster innovation within the biotech sector. This approach may particularly benefit companies developing breakthrough therapies, such as those in oncology and gene therapy.
* Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Analysts anticipate that a Trump-led Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will adopt a more accommodating stance toward M&A activities. This could facilitate consolidation and strategic partnerships within the biotech industry, potentially leading to increased investment and growth opportunities.

The Detroit automaker said Monday it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of about $10 billion. It had previously guided to between $10 billion and $12 billion. It retained its forecast for adjusted free cash flow of between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion.

Here’s how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 49 cents adj. vs. 47 cents adj. expected

Automotive revenue: $43.07 billion vs. $41.88 billion expected

The automaker was under pressure after a disappointing second quarter in which unexpected warranty costs caused the company to miss Wall Street’s earnings expectations.

Swing % up unrealized 2.06%.                                                   

Day Trade % up realized 20.21%


Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. 

Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 

1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically),  trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 

2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/)

3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 

4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/](https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/)

5. The markets also have annual patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/](https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/)

6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not.

Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: 

Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching.

Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$.

https://preview.redd.it/8zbntxysskvd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16ae98b361ef74c7bc126c989a58a93c16a7cc

Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. 

This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'!

https://preview.redd.it/mv82q8k3ukvd1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa926cbdb63efe7f23aff5d2202c3c359082cb60

So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/8f1hqy7pukvd1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3862943df5ed00ad5eb402251843e66924e93fb

Day trading is much more profitable than swing trading and long term investing. I often day trade and hold overnight during up trending seasons for the reasons illustrated above. Oh, yeah, I also do not use stop losses. So, F your stop loss.

Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. 

This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'!

So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025.

Day Trade % up realized 20.21%


Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. 

Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 

1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically),  trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 

2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/)

3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 

4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/](https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/)

5. The markets also have annual patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/](https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/)

6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not.

Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: 

Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching.

Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass—and throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk’s SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel *just a little* uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump’s border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a “lowball” deal to buy the land—at less than half its value. CAH’s response? “Go f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.”

**""Wait—Cards Against** ***Who*****?"":** In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump’s border wall construction. The plot was left in its “natural state,” with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX’s construction activities—like compacting soil and setting up generators—have, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation—and Customer Trust:** CAH’s complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX’s invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let’s be honest—nothing says “we’re here to fight for your rights” like defending a piece of borderland against the world’s richest man. They’re worried that fans might start thinking they’re somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town—complete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday—about $100—on their $15 contribution. That’s a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

# Meta Connect 2024: AR Glasses, Cheaper VR, and a Heavy Dose of AI

Mark your calendars, tech fans. Meta’s annual Connect developer conference kicks off on September 25th, and it's shaping up to be a buffet of VR, AR, and AI goodies. Expect new hardware, upgraded smart glasses, and AI innovations sprinkled across Meta's platforms like an everything-bagel seasoning.

Meta CEO *and part-time metaverse evangelist* Mark Zuckerberg will lead the keynote, which you can catch on Meta’s website or Horizon Worlds (if you’re living that VR life). Alongside him will be CTO Andrew Bosworth, who will dive deeper into all things AI and AR.

# What's Coming?

Here’s the big stuff Meta might have in store:

* **A New, Cheaper VR Headset:** Word on the street is Meta will unveil a stripped-down version of the Quest 3, the ""Quest 3S,"" priced at a more wallet-friendly $299. The goal? Offer a VR experience that doesn’t break the bank, without sacrificing too much of the Quest 3’s tech magic. If leaks are accurate, this model could bridge the gap between the aging Quest 2 and the pricey Quest 3.
* **Smart Glasses 2.0:** Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are due for an update, and rumors suggest they’ll be getting some AI juice. While the glasses won't quite be AR wizards yet, they’re expected to bring new features, like voice-controlled AI, straight to your stylish shades. Plus, we might get a glimpse of *“Orion,”* Meta’s true AR glasses that could change how we see (literally) reality.
* **AI All Day, Every Day:** AI will be the star of the show, with Meta expected to roll out new chatbot assistants, smarter AI-powered tools, and possibly some celebrity avatars. *Llama 3.1*, Meta’s latest large language model, will likely pop up across Meta’s platforms—think WhatsApp and Instagram with even more AI sass.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month’s report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won’t break the trend, but everyone’s hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates—and home prices—down eventually.

Next up, we’ll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn’t help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Before Market Open:

* **Autozone** ($AZO) has revved up nearly 18% in 2024, fueled by an ambitious share buyback strategy over the past few years. But under the hood, last quarter’s earnings show a few warning lights: same-store sales were stagnant, and free cash flow is starting to slow.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass—and throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk’s SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel *just a little* uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump’s border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a “lowball” deal to buy the land—at less than half its value. CAH’s response? “Go f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.”

**""Wait—Cards Against** ***Who*****?"":** In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump’s border wall construction. The plot was left in its “natural state,” with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX’s construction activities—like compacting soil and setting up generators—have, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation—and Customer Trust:** CAH’s complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX’s invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let’s be honest—nothing says “we’re here to fight for your rights” like defending a piece of borderland against the world’s richest man. They’re worried that fans might start thinking they’re somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town—complete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday—about $100—on their $15 contribution. That’s a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

# Meta Connect 2024: AR Glasses, Cheaper VR, and a Heavy Dose of AI

Mark your calendars, tech fans. Meta’s annual Connect developer conference kicks off on September 25th, and it's shaping up to be a buffet of VR, AR, and AI goodies. Expect new hardware, upgraded smart glasses, and AI innovations sprinkled across Meta's platforms like an everything-bagel seasoning.

Meta CEO *and part-time metaverse evangelist* Mark Zuckerberg will lead the keynote, which you can catch on Meta’s website or Horizon Worlds (if you’re living that VR life). Alongside him will be CTO Andrew Bosworth, who will dive deeper into all things AI and AR.

# What's Coming?

Here’s the big stuff Meta might have in store:

* **A New, Cheaper VR Headset:** Word on the street is Meta will unveil a stripped-down version of the Quest 3, the ""Quest 3S,"" priced at a more wallet-friendly $299. The goal? Offer a VR experience that doesn’t break the bank, without sacrificing too much of the Quest 3’s tech magic. If leaks are accurate, this model could bridge the gap between the aging Quest 2 and the pricey Quest 3.
* **Smart Glasses 2.0:** Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are due for an update, and rumors suggest they’ll be getting some AI juice. While the glasses won't quite be AR wizards yet, they’re expected to bring new features, like voice-controlled AI, straight to your stylish shades. Plus, we might get a glimpse of *“Orion,”* Meta’s true AR glasses that could change how we see (literally) reality.
* **AI All Day, Every Day:** AI will be the star of the show, with Meta expected to roll out new chatbot assistants, smarter AI-powered tools, and possibly some celebrity avatars. *Llama 3.1*, Meta’s latest large language model, will likely pop up across Meta’s platforms—think WhatsApp and Instagram with even more AI sass.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month’s report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won’t break the trend, but everyone’s hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates—and home prices—down eventually.

Next up, we’ll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn’t help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Before Market Open:

* **Autozone** ($AZO) has revved up nearly 18% in 2024, fueled by an ambitious share buyback strategy over the past few years. But under the hood, last quarter’s earnings show a few warning lights: same-store sales were stagnant, and free cash flow is starting to slow.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass—and throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk’s SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel *just a little* uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump’s border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a “lowball” deal to buy the land—at less than half its value. CAH’s response? “Go f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.”

**""Wait—Cards Against** ***Who*****?"":** In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump’s border wall construction. The plot was left in its “natural state,” with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX’s construction activities—like compacting soil and setting up generators—have, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation—and Customer Trust:** CAH’s complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX’s invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let’s be honest—nothing says “we’re here to fight for your rights” like defending a piece of borderland against the world’s richest man. They’re worried that fans might start thinking they’re somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town—complete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday—about $100—on their $15 contribution. That’s a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

# Meta Connect 2024: AR Glasses, Cheaper VR, and a Heavy Dose of AI

Mark your calendars, tech fans. Meta’s annual Connect developer conference kicks off on September 25th, and it's shaping up to be a buffet of VR, AR, and AI goodies. Expect new hardware, upgraded smart glasses, and AI innovations sprinkled across Meta's platforms like an everything-bagel seasoning.

Meta CEO *and part-time metaverse evangelist* Mark Zuckerberg will lead the keynote, which you can catch on Meta’s website or Horizon Worlds (if you’re living that VR life). Alongside him will be CTO Andrew Bosworth, who will dive deeper into all things AI and AR.

# What's Coming?

Here’s the big stuff Meta might have in store:

* **A New, Cheaper VR Headset:** Word on the street is Meta will unveil a stripped-down version of the Quest 3, the ""Quest 3S,"" priced at a more wallet-friendly $299. The goal? Offer a VR experience that doesn’t break the bank, without sacrificing too much of the Quest 3’s tech magic. If leaks are accurate, this model could bridge the gap between the aging Quest 2 and the pricey Quest 3.
* **Smart Glasses 2.0:** Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are due for an update, and rumors suggest they’ll be getting some AI juice. While the glasses won't quite be AR wizards yet, they’re expected to bring new features, like voice-controlled AI, straight to your stylish shades. Plus, we might get a glimpse of *“Orion,”* Meta’s true AR glasses that could change how we see (literally) reality.
* **AI All Day, Every Day:** AI will be the star of the show, with Meta expected to roll out new chatbot assistants, smarter AI-powered tools, and possibly some celebrity avatars. *Llama 3.1*, Meta’s latest large language model, will likely pop up across Meta’s platforms—think WhatsApp and Instagram with even more AI sass.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month’s report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won’t break the trend, but everyone’s hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates—and home prices—down eventually.

Next up, we’ll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn’t help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Before Market Open:

* **Autozone** ($AZO) has revved up nearly 18% in 2024, fueled by an ambitious share buyback strategy over the past few years. But under the hood, last quarter’s earnings show a few warning lights: same-store sales were stagnant, and free cash flow is starting to slow. With consumer spending tightening, investors are eager to hear how management plans to steer things back on track—otherwise, Autozone’s impressive run could hit a dead end. Analysts expect $53.53 EPS on $6.22 billion in revenue.",2024-09-23,8,0

* U.S. stocks inched higher on Monday as traders parsed through Federal Reserve commentary, still riding the wave of last week’s 50-basis-point rate cut. The S&P 500 nudged up 0.28%, getting cozy with its all-time high, while the Dow and Nasdaq didn’t want to be left out, both closing at record levels. 
* It’s been a winning streak on Wall Street since the Fed cut rates for the first time in four years. Investors are keeping their ears perked for any Fed hints about what’s next while the U.S. economy shows signs of strength, especially in the services sector. The soft-landing narrative? Still very much alive.

Ford just started paying dividends in 2012 after spending 5 years of not paying them. In addition you have long streaks of them not raising dividends and a few of actually lowering them. 

But on the other hand the current price makes the current yield 5.54%. Based on forward estimates they can afford it by a nice margin, specially from their cash flow. A lowering of interest rates should be good for their business.

They look attractive, but I'm hung on my dislike of companies that don't consistently raise their dividends over time. Does anybody here care to share what they think about F?

But as the industrywide transition to electric vehicles takes off more slowly than anticipated, the automaker has adjusted its product plans to focus less on all-electric vehicles and more on hybrids.

Most recently, Ford last week said it plans to expand production of its large Super Duty trucks to a Canadian plant that was previously set to be converted into an all-electric vehicle hub.

1duhbjq_F,F,"Ford sales edge 1% higher in the second quarter, led by trucks ","Ford sales rose 1% during the second quarter over the year-earlier period, led by a 5% gain in truck sales, the automaker said Wednesday.

Ford truck sales, which include pickups and vans, totaled 308,920 vehicles during the period, the company’s best second-quarter performance for the category since 2019, Ford said. Sales in its F-Series totaled 199,463 vehicles.

Sales of Ford electric vehicles totaled 23,957 during the second quarter, up 61%. The automaker said its EVs, in particular the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, are drawing new customers to the company.

Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles totaled 53,822, an increase of 56% and a new quarterly sales record for Ford since it began offering hybrid models more than 20 years ago, it said. Automakers including Ford have been leaning on hybrids to ease the EV transition and help achieve tightening federal fuel efficiency standards.

The update comes a day after Ford’s crosstown rival General Motors reported second-quarter sales that rose 0.6% from a year earlier. GM said total sales of 696,086 made for its highest quarterly sales mark since the fourth quarter of 2020.

Even modest sales increases for both Ford and GM outpace expectations for the overall market. Auto industry forecasters including Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide to be roughly flat year over year.

1cya7k3_F,F,"E.l.f. Beauty defies slowdown that Ulta warned about, posts first $1B year ","E.l.f. Beauty posted its first billion-dollar fiscal year on Wednesday, growing sales by 77% and further disputing warnings from Ulta that retail’s most resilient category is losing steam. 

The eyes, lip, face company, known for its viral marketing and prowess in winning over younger consumers, blew past Wall Street’s estimates on the top and bottom line. However, its guidance came in lower than expected, indicating it anticipates its growth will begin to taper. 

Here’s how E.l.f. Beauty did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 53 cents adjusted vs. 32 cents expected

Revenue: $321.1 million vs. $292.6 million expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended March 31 was $14.53 million, or 25 cents per share, compared with $16.25 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. posted earnings of 53 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $321.1 million, up about 71% from $187.4 million a year earlier.

For the full year, the company’s sales grew to $1.02 billion, an increase of 77% from the year-ago period.

E.l.f. Beauty has been on a tear over the last year, posting sales gains in the high double digit percentages quarter after quarter as consumers flock to its low-priced beauty products either through its own website or at retailers like Walmart and Target. 

In a statement, E.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin said he believes the company is still in the “early innings” of its growth story and expects more to come in cosmetics, skin care and in international markets. Its guidance reflects that sentiment, but even so, the company expects to grow at a slower pace than Wall Street anticipated. 

E.l.f. expects net sales to be between $1.23 billion and $1.25 billion, which would be an increase of 20% to 22%. That’s below the $1.27 billion, or 27.4% uptick, that analysts had expected.

The company is forecasting adjusted net income to be between $187 million and $191 million, and adjusted earnings to be between $3.20 and $3.25 per share. That’s below the $3.51 that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Last month, Ulta Beauty CEO Dave Kimbell threw cold water on the red-hot beauty category when he warned that demand for cosmetics was cooling, sending its stock down 15% that day and hitting shares of E.l.f, Estée Lauder and Coty.

“We have seen a slowdown in the total category,” Kimbell said at an investor conference hosted by JPMorgan Chase. “We came into the year — and we talked about this on our [earnings] call a few weeks ago — expecting the category to moderate. It has [had], as I said, several years of strong growth. We did not anticipate it would continue at the rate that it’s been growing.”

He added that the slowdown has been “a bit earlier” and a “bit bigger than we thought.” 

Just how much Ulta’s sales have slowed down remains to be seen. The beauty giant reports earnings next week.

1bmcxfu_MS,MS,United Airlines Faces Closer F.A.A. Scrutiny After Safety Incidents,"The Federal Aviation Administration will scrutinize United Airlines’ operations more closely in coming weeks after a spate of recent safety incidents, the airline told employees in a memo on Friday.  
“We will begin to see more of an F.A.A. presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,” Sasha Johnson, a vice president of corporate safety at the airline, said in the memo. “We welcome their engagement and are very open to hear from them about what they find and their perspective on things we may need to change to make us even safer.""  
In some of the incidents, which United has said were unrelated, a plane veered off a runway, another arrived at its destination with a panel missing from its body, another lost a tire after takeoff and an engine caught fire after ingesting plastic wrapping.  
The F.A.A. said in a statement on Friday that it “routinely” monitored airline operations. The agency said it “focuses on an airline’s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.”  
In the United memo, Ms. Johnson said the agency would “also pause a variety of certification activities for a period of time.” The F.A.A. said in a statement on Saturday that certification processes already underway might be allowed to continue, but that future ones could be delayed, depending on what it found. The agency oversees and approves a wide range of airline activities, such as pilot training or new flight routes.

1b3kl34_F,F,"Tesla stands to earn billions by opening U.S. chargers to drivers of Ford, other EVs","As of Thursday, owners of Ford electric vehicles — the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning — in North America finally have the ability to power up using Tesla Superchargers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley wrote in a post on LinkedIn that the charging partnership, which involves use of fast-charging adapters, should “improve the EV ownership experience,” for Ford EV drivers, noting that “I’ve tested it myself and its works great.”

Tesla has forged a similar agreement with General Motors, which was announced in June, giving GM customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla fast chargers in the U.S and Canada. GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.

The partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla’s charging network and his company’s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.

But Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.

Sam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.

Currently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, “Tesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,” by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.

While Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.

“People shopping for a Tesla aren’t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,” Fiorani wrote. “Competition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.”

Allowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Tesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,” Fiorani wrote.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for further information.

Tesla reports charging revenue with its “Total automotive & services and other segment revenue.” The company hasn’t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.

William Navarro Jameson, Tesla’s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of “interoperability testing” along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.

“There have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,” he wrote.

On social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.

F,"Welcome to the 100-Day Smart Trading Challenge, inspired by the 75 Hard program and 'The Mental Game of Trading'. This challenge aims to improve consistency in trading by focusing on performance during average (B-game) and challenging (C-game) days, using Jared Tendler's inchworm learning model: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y0QX5NUSuQ&t=419s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y0QX5NUSuQ&t=419s).

Success in trading is about enhancing performance on B and C days to align with the A-game. By improving these days, we set a foundation for consistent, successful trading and readiness for new skill acquisition.

Here's what to do:

1. Identify common bad-day habits/mistakes and create rules to overcome them.
2. Follow these rules for 100 days, integrating them into habits.
3. Keep a journal, rating each day as A, B, or C, and note mistakes on B and C days.
4. Restart the challenge if a rule is broken.
5. After 100 days, add new habits/mistakes and rules to your list.
6. Post on this platform for accountability and encouragement if you break a rule.
7. Track your list of rules, daily profit/loss, total profit/loss, challenge day, restart count, and any other progress notes.

**If you're participating, here's what we want to track.**

* Today’s Profit/Loss
* Total Profit/Loss for the challenge
* What day you're on
* How many times you've restarted.
* Notes
* Anything else that helps you track your progress and stay accountable. This is your personal trading journey.

**--===My entry for today===--**

* My list of rules for the challenge
   * New Rules this challenge -
      * Don't take additional trades after I fall under my personal stop limit (doesn't require me to exit a trade at the stop limit). -- $800 (my daily stop = my average daily win on winning days)
      * Take appropriate size.
      * Avoid shooting twice (eg don't re-enter a trade unless there is fresh, good signal)
      * Make sure trades are confirmed with proper volume -- and if expected volume doesn't come, exit.
   * Previous Rules
      * Perform daily pre-work every day, no exceptions. (News, affirmations, journal review, reports/data, technical analysis)
      * Never trade on insufficient sleep, when emotionally compromised, sick, or other outside forces that may affect me emotionally.
      * Trades must be from my 'playbook' or have a well documented thesis for one-off opportunities.
      * No new trades during Wall Street's lunch break, until volume starts to come back up.
      * Be 5x as picky on afternoon trades, or when things are going poorly.
* Today’s Profit$Loss: (-**$3891.00)**

* How many times you've restarted: **4**
* Longest streak: **9**

I have literally one thing that stops me from being profitable, and this is it. I can't take an L and I double down and take too much size and try to make a comeback and blow huge amounts of money. I do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over. The entire point of this challenge for me, right now, is to try and address this.

I made a good trade that didn't work, then I made a bad trade that did work. Up $9.

Then I made a good trade, but I was in a little early, got booped out, and absolutely freaked. Took max size positions going each way. On my 3rd attempt hit it and made a good chunk of my money back, didn't take my exit, rode it right back down to negative and lost even more.

>An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to “go f— yourself”.

Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.

The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter’s billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.

Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to “kill” the company, adding: “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.”

Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire’s freewheeling personal style.

Fidelity’s valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.

The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk’s takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.

However, Twitter’s own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October – less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",2024-01-01,930,380

This discussion on r/askcarsales makes it clear that Ford has a big problem with EV sales. Inventory is building up at many dealers across the country, and the dealers are stuck with them because they're all trying to avoid taking a loss. The expectation is that Ford will have to offer a big incentive to get those vehicles sold. They've already slashed production on the F-150 Lightning EV because that's not selling well either.

Is this a shorting opportunity, or am I reading too much into this?",2023-12-24,89,134

**--===My entry for today===--**

* My list of rules for the challenge
   * Respect my personal daily stop limit
   * Take appropriate size
   * Avoid shooting twice (eg don't re-enter a trade unless there is fresh, good signal)
   * Make sure trades are confirmed with proper volume

* Total Profit/Loss for the challenge: $273.35
* What day you're on: Day 0
* How many times you've restarted: 1
* Longest streak: 2 (lol)
* Notes - Hit a restart today because I did all the things. Re-entered positions, exceeded my daily stop, shot twice, and took too much size. I was down like $350, more than double my personal stop of $150, and I took max size positions to get back on top, which is about triple my appropriate size. The reason these problems are so seductive for me is that I often start too fast, then settle down and see a good trade and try to make up for it, and it works. It probably works 2/3 or 3/4 of the time. Unfortunately, sometimes that makeup trade doesn't work, and sometimes I'm just not trading well and try to do it anyway. When that happens I have huge blowups. Today was an example of it working, but the RIGHT answer is to slow down, wait for the A+ setup to manifest, and then take the good trade right off the bat... but also to follow my rules so I can actually be consistent. Very frustrating but I'm glad I get to be accountable here and lucky I made a small profit instead of having a blowup. Update --- Took an A+ trade that didn't work, went from up $25 to up $1... and then did the whole double down too much size thing again. Locked in profit and took an exit as soon as I had an opportunity because I don't want to cement that bad habit by taking a win off of it if it works out... and don't want to make my day a huge L if it doesn't. Not supposed to trade based on outcomes, but yeesh, I'm a mess today. Tomorrow is a new day.",2023-12-06,18,19

Ford Motor is scaling back plans for a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan as consumers move to electric vehicles more slowly than expected, labor costs rise and the company moves to cut costs.  
  
Ford executives including CEO Jim Farley and Chair Bill Ford initially announced the facility in February. It quickly became a political target due to its connection to Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL. The plant is a wholly-owned Ford subsidiary, but the U.S. automaker is licensing technology from CATL to produce new lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries for EVs.  
  
Ford said Tuesday that it is cutting production capacity by roughly 43% to 20 gigawatt hours per year and reducing expected employment from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 jobs. The company declined to disclose how much less it would invest in the plant. Based on the reduced capacity, it would still be about a $2 billion investment.  
  
The decision adds to a recent retreat from EVs by automakers globally. Demand for the vehicles is lower than expected due to higher costs and challenges with supply chains and battery technologies, among other issues.  
  
Reductions at the Marshall, Michigan plant are part of Ford’s plans announced last month to cut or delay about $12 billion in previously announced EV investments. The company will also postpone construction of another electric vehicle battery plant in Kentucky.

“We looked at all the factors. Those included demand and the expected growth for EVs, our business plans, our product cycle plans, the affordability and business to make sure we have we can make a sustainable business out of this plant,” Ford Chief Communications Officer Mark Truby said during a media briefing. “After assessing all that, we are now good to confirm that we’re moving forward with the plant, albeit in a slightly smaller size and scope than what we originally announced.”  
  
Truby said the plant is still expected to open in 2026, even though the company halted production of the facility for roughly two months during collective bargaining with the United Auto Workers. The talks ended last week as Ford-UAW employees ratified a deal that included significant wage increases and a path for battery workers at the plant to be included under the record agreement, if organized by the union.  
  
The UAW did not immediately respond for a request for comment.

Increased labor costs factored into Ford’s decision to scale back the plans, according to Truby. Ford CFO John Lawler last month said the new deal would add $850 to $900 per vehicle assembled in labor costs.  
  
Lawler declined to estimate how much the deal, which runs through April 2028, will cost the company. Deutsche Bank estimated the increase to be $6.2 billion during the terms of the deal.  
  
“We’re still very bullish on EVs and our EV strategy, but clearly, while there is growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide, clearly, the growth isn’t at the rate that that we and others had expected,” Truby said. “We’re trying to be smart about this and how we move forward.”  
  
The plant has received political pushback from federal and local officials, including protests by residents in the rural Michigan city. U.S. lawmakers also have sought to review the licensing deal between Ford and CATL amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.  
  
Truby reiterated Tuesday that the company still believes it’s better business for the company and U.S. to license the technology instead of importing batteries from overseas. The plant is expected to be the first in the U.S. to produce LFP batteries.  
  
Lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries the plant will produce are deployed instead of pricier lithium-ion or nickel cobalt manganese batteries, which Ford is currently using. The new batteries are expected to offer different benefits at a lower cost, allow Ford to increase EV production and profit margins.  
  
Ford, which is currently sourcing LFP batteries from CATL, follows Tesla in using LFP batteries in a portion of its vehicles in part to reduce the amount of cobalt needed to make battery cells and high-voltage battery packs.

The S&P Global cutting its 2023 GDP growth forecast for China to 5.2% from 5.5% previously is a sign that the post-COVID recovery is faltering. Artificial intelligence stocks have also slumped, indicating that the tech sector is not immune to the economic slowdown.

However, there are some positives to be taken from the situation. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index edged up 0.1%, and tech giants listed in Hong Kong edged up 0.3%. Oil was slightly higher on Monday as an abortive weekend mutiny by Russian mercenaries raised questions about crude supply.

Overall, it is clear that the Chinese economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic. It is likely that the Chinese government will need to step in with more stimulus measures in order to jump-start the economy. However, it is also possible that the Chinese economy could be resilient enough to weather the storm without any additional government intervention. Only time will tell.

However, it is important to note that this task force is only a small part of the larger effort needed to combat the growing problem of cybercrime.

The anonymity of the dark web and the use of cryptocurrencies make it difficult for law enforcement to track down criminals. The task force will be able to use its resources to identify and apprehend criminals, but it is still limited in its ability to effectively combat the issue.

The use of cryptocurrencies also has its benefits. Cryptocurrencies are a fast and efficient way to transfer money, and they are becoming increasingly popular as a way to make payments. This is especially true in countries where traditional banking systems are not available or not reliable.

However, the anonymity of cryptocurrencies also makes them attractive to criminals. Criminals can use cryptocurrencies to hide their identities and launder money. This is a major concern for law enforcement, as it makes it difficult to track down criminals and prosecute them.

In addition, the use of cryptocurrencies can also be used to facilitate illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering. This is a major concern for law enforcement, as it makes it difficult to track down criminals and prosecute them.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Representatives for Tesla and Ford did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours.",2023-04-21,1914,577

1042utv_F,F,Ford F-Series continued to dominate truck sales in 2022,"&#x200B;

* **The Ford F-Series continued its decades long U.S. sales dominance in 2022 despite ongoing parts and supply chain problems, the company said.**
* **The 2022 sales make for an average of at least one F-Series Truck sold every 49 seconds last year.**
* **Still, F-Series sales are expected to come in lower than in recent years.**

Ford Motor reported sales of its F-Series, which includes the F-150 pickup and its larger siblings, surpassed 640,000 trucks last year – making it America’s bestselling truck for 46 consecutive years and bestselling vehicle for 41 years.

Despite topping the sales charts, F-Series sales are expected to come in lower than in recent years. Sales of the truck were off nearly 13% through November compared with a year earlier, however Ford said last month’s sales are anticipated to be the best of 2022 for the F-Series.

Ford sold 726,004 F-Series trucks in 2021, which was a 7.8% decline from more than 787,400 vehicles in 2020. Before the pandemic, the company had been selling about 900,000 of the trucks annually.

There are fears on Wall Street that the most profitable days for automakers such as Ford may be behind them amid higher interest rates, falling used vehicle prices and a normalization of sales mix away from fully loaded models.

Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan highlighted such challenges — and a renewed emphasis on Ford’s monthly sales reports — in a note to investors on Tuesday citing negative catalysts for the automaker.

Ford is set to report its total year-end sales today, a day after other major automakers are expected to release results. [Souce: CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/ford-f-series-2022-sales-show-pickup-continued-decades-long-dominance.html)

# Ford vs GM

While the F-Series nameplate has led the sales charts for decades, Ford has not been the bestselling automaker of full-size pickup trucks in recent years. That title has gone to [General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GM/), which sells two full-size pickups.

GM sells the higher-priced GMC Sierra alongside the Chevy Silverado. Combined sales of both pickups outnumbered Ford and other rivals through the third quarter.

GM spokesman Jim Cain downplayed the F-Series rankings, saying the company is well positioned to capture full-size truck sales leadership for a third consecutive year.

# Is Ford worth a closer look?

Ford's classic F-Series of pickup trucks has been America’s bestselling vehicle for 4 decades, continuing production throughout parts shortages in recent years, even partially building vehicles for a later completion date. By the end of 2021, its new electric F-150 Lightning had 200,000 reservations with a 3-year backlog.

Ford has a strong brand and a long history of operation, with a diverse product lineup that includes both traditional internal combustion engines and electric and autonomous vehicles. The company has a global presence, with operations in various regions around the world.

However, the automotive industry is facing several challenges, including increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, and the need to invest in new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. These factors may impact the company's financial performance and may make it more difficult to generate consistent profits.

Shown in the picture is the analysis curve of my month so far. I started trading options and lost quite a bit, made the switch to futures, lost more, and then moved to a strategy that relies on removing your ""Indicators that will make you $$$$$$$"" and encompasses just pure price action and market structure. I've been decently profitable the last couple of months. The only indicator I have on my chart is the 21 EMA. The win rate of this curve is 69.7% trading ES futures. As you can see you will have losing trades, most of them are from taking a trade when I shouldn't have. Psychology and your emotions can be a bitch when trading lmao.

I'll start the day out by observing the daily chart, 10,000 tick chart, and I will day trade off of the 2,000 tick chart.

For those looking for trading strategies (mainly within futures), I recommend price action trading. On YouTube you can find it by watching Thomas Wade & PATSTrading.",2022-12-24,202,71

What a month November was. I'm excited about December! In my previous posts, there has been hate on the trading strategy that consists of just pure price action and market structure (not sure why), but I just want to keep preaching that if you are struggling within futures, seriously look into learning price action and market structure. I will, again and again, suggest Thomas Wade on YouTube as he has so much free content on price action when it comes to trading futures.

I myself try to go for a 1:1 risk-to-reward with the strategy instead of a 1-point profit like what is commonly used in this strategy and I typically trade with 5 contracts. 

The strategy in itself isn't some magical strat to win all your trades. I still lose quite a bit but the important thing is managing your losers and waiting for valid setups, and most importantly (IMO) trading on the right side of the market, and that is when understanding market structure comes into play. A lot of my losers were me not zooming out and getting the bigger picture. After a loser, I take a moment and analyze what went wrong and most of the time, it's because I didn't have the market structure in mind. The other times I have lost is just from getting trapped and/or the setup just not working, which happens.

yyqa9j_F,F,Madison Metals uranium explorer - only 30 million shares F/D and more than $5 million cash,"Madison Metals ([GREN.CN](https://GREN.CN),  MMTLF) just completed a financing by issuing a small number of NFTs to raise more than $5 million.  This is the only uranium story that is funded using an NFT strategy and the plan makes sense.  Unlike most other commodities, investors are not allowed to take direct leverage in uranium.  An NFT backed by physical uranium is therefore the best option to secure ownership of physical uranium.  There are uranium ETFs that are investigating buying the NFTs issued by Madison as a means to build their leverage in fact.  Secondly, the NFT strategy does not carry the burden of equity dilution as all other uranium explorers face in order to raise money.  With only 30 million shares on a fully diluted basis, Madison provides greater shareholder leverage to the upside as exploration gets underway.  Another round of NFTs are going to be issued in the new year to raise even more money. 

I think Madison is in that junior sweet spot that makes it attractive:  Low shares outstanding, low market cap, with high quality property holdings, a strong cash position and no debt. I have started accumulating this one for my PF.",2022-11-18,1,1

At the time of my last post, they were about to drill. Now they’ve completed the first of 7 drills in the SASB region. It was the longest and most difficult to drill and it was done on time and on budget. In a week or so they will test the flow and then start producing. The next well is a recompletion, meaning it’s already been drilled and was put on hold a few years ago. That will only take a week or so to get on line. When production starts, that is when you will see the stock move. I’d say you have about 2 weeks at most to get in. 

This is a penny stock that will have massive FCF in a few weeks. When I posted 3 months ago the TRLEF price was $0.23 – now it’s $0.33. My guess is $0.80 by year end. That's a great return in a super shitty market. It’s all about energy right now.

Ford sent an internal email Monday to employees, saying it would begin notifying affected salaried and agency workers this week of the cuts. The email was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The workforce reduction mostly targets employees in the U.S., Canada and India. About 2,000 of the targeted cuts will be salaried jobs at the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker. The remaining 1,000 employees are working in contract positions with outside agencies, the company said.

The cuts weren’t unexpected. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported in July that layoffs were coming for white-collar staff as part of a broader restructuring to sharpen the car company’s focus on electric vehicles and the batteries that power them.

wh1igw_F,F,Piotroski's F score - how good is it and does it still beat the market?,"A little bit over 2 decades ago, Joseph Piotroski published a research paper titled "" Value Investing: The use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers "". This is when the F-score was public for the first time. 

The goal of this post is to explain how the score was created and everything that's important to know about it.

As always, for those who prefer to watch a video, here's the link [https://youtu.be/5805hniU0gs](https://youtu.be/5805hniU0gs)

If someone wants to go through the published paper, here's the link:  https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/prg/asam/2019/F-Score.pdf 

**The reasoning and the initial selection of companies**

Joseph Piotroski was working on creating an investment strategy that is based on the fundamentals of the companies that have **high book/market values** (or in modern terms, low price/book ratios).

What is very common about companies with low price/book ratios is that they're likely to be financially distressed, could go bankrupt, and hence are trading at a price close to their book values. The reasoning behind this was that these particular companies are less followed by the analyst community and have a low level of investor interest. In many cases, there are no forecasts available or stock recommendations.

Therefore, the companies that are going to recover from this more difficult financial position are likely to provide returns above the market. Now the question was, how can someone identify the companies that are going to do better within this category? That leads us to the F-score.

&#x200B;

**The Piotroski's F-score**

Joseph Piotroski came up with 9 binary signals that are based on the financial statements of a company and based on how many of those are present, a company has a score between 0 and 9. These signals were grouped into 3 buckets:

***Bucket #1: Profitability***

1. **Positive return on assets** \- If the company is profitable, then it would have a positive return on assets and therefore get a tick for this signal being present.
2. **Positive cash from operations** \- If the cash makes money from its operations, then the signal is present
3. **Positive change in RoA year-over-year** \- If the company's return on assets improved compared to the previous year, it means it's moving in the right direction
4. **Cash from operations > Net profit** \- This takes into account the accruals.

Basically, all of these questions together answer whether the company is profitable enough and brings enough cash to survive.

&#x200B;

***Bucket #2: Leverage, liquidity and source of funds***

1. **Decrease in long-term debt/total assets year-over-year** \- One of the worst possible signals for a struggling company is if the debt keeps increasing. However, if it decreases, it means it is moving in a good direction.
2. **Increase in current ratio** \- Although the idea behind this is great, it has its flows. If a company's current ratio decreases by 0.0001 or 1, it is irrelevant. The magnitude of the change is not taken into account. If a certain company have excess cash and puts it into use or gives it back to the shareholders, even though it is a great decision, it would be seen as a negative event for the F-score
3. **Equal or decreasing shares outstanding** \- Not dilution the existing shareholders is definitely important to have as one of the signals. Otherwise, a company could issue more shares in exchange for cash and use part of that to pay its long-term debt. In this case, the 2 signals above would be met (as the debt would decrease and the current assets would increase)

&#x200B;

***Bucket #3 Operating efficiency***

1. **Increase in gross margin** *-* As the idea is to identify companies that are improving, this signal is definitely a great one. Although, it can be argued that the operating margin would do an even better job as it takes into account the operating expenses.
2. **Increase in asset turnover** \- This particular signal is focused on the usage of the assets.

&#x200B;

**Calculation of returns**

Now, if we put ourselves in the shoes of Joseph, we have identified the companies that have low price/book ratio, we have calculated the F-score for each one and now what? Well, we need to calculate the return of these companies and compare them with the market return.

Joseph measured the return from the beginning of the **fifth month** after the company's fiscal year-end for a year (or two, as he run multiple backtests). What this means is, if a company's fiscal year is January 1st until December 31st, he would measure the 1-year return starting from May 1st up until April 30th the following year.

His reasoning for choosing the fifth month is to ensure that the necessary annual information is available to investors at the time of the portfolio creation.

&#x200B;

**The outcome**

The backtesting was done for the period between 1976 and 1996 and the outcome is what made this paper so famous. 

The mean performance of the companies with an F-score of 0 (Meaning, not profitable, not having positive cash from operations, etc, etc.) was 6.1% below the market.

The mean performance of the companies with an F-score of 9 was 15.9% above the market!

Now, personally, everytime I hear something that's too good to be true, I have a tendency to be skeptical and think that it is probably too good to be true. So, what's the catch?

&#x200B;

There were 14,043 companies that were part of the backtesting, 333 of them had an F-score of 9. Let's focus on these as they had the best score!

Well, the worst performing 10% of them underperformed the market by 46%. The worst 25% underperformed the market by 27%. The median company with an F-score of 9 underperformed the market by 1.2%. The best 10% overperformed the market by 89%! So, it is quite clear that the winners do exceptionally well, but how many are there?

171 out of the 333 companies underperformed the market. Although the average return of the companies with a high F-score did better than the average company with a low F-score, the score doesn't provide information to pick a stock. That means, if someone wants to put this into practice, the only way would be to buy a piece of all the 333 companies.

&#x200B;

Joseph also did another test. He divided all the companies into two groups: High F-score (if the score is greater than 5) and low F-score (If the score is below 5) and compared their returns for every year between 1976 and 1996. In almost all of the years (except 3) the high F-score companies did better. How better? 9.7%.

&#x200B;

**Recent back-testing**

There have been many backtests done recently and the outcome is quite similar. There are years when Piotroski's F-score beats the market, but there are plenty of them when the score doesn't do a good job. It is significantly more volatile compared to the S&P and it requires investing in a significant number of companies.

In the original paper Joseph made a point that if an investor shorts the companies with low F-scores and buys the companies with high F-scores, the return would be 23% annualized!

Unfortunately, if the same strategy was applied in the last 2 decades, the investor would've lost money.

&#x200B;

**My thoughts**

Every research paper involves a level of cherry-picking, slicing, and dicing the data, in order to get to a **statistically significant** outcome. Joseph Piotroski did that in 3 areas:

&#x200B;

1. He chose companies with low price/book ratios.
2. He chose a period between 1976 and 1996. The paper was published in 2000, so he could've added a few more years, but also he could've started much earlier.
3. He measures the returns 5 months after the financial year-end. Not 4, not 6, but 5.

If any of these 3 variables changed, the outcome of the F-score backtest would change.

Although I don't see any way to implement the score into my investment strategy (I have no intention of buying a piece of 300+ companies), there are some great fundamental signals that should not be ignored. It makes sense to avoid companies with low F-scores.

**Common mistake**

Knowing that the F-score was created based on companies with low price/book ratios, it would not be reasonable to use it to assess the financial strength of a company that's stable. That doesn't mean the 9 signals are not relevant, but that a score greater than 7 is more common for companies with a high price/book ratio",2022-08-05,10,6

vm3djk_TSLA,TSLA,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",2022-06-27,507,492

Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (Sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?

I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Piotroski F Score, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and it heavily favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.

Pasted below is a link to a GoogleSheets spreadsheet that has the entire list.

What are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight. I'm always looking for ways to refine my methodology and scoring, so any suggestions would be appreciated.

Decent outlook/growth compared to other american car companies IMO, I mean if there's one US car company that has been around for awhile and will continue succeed it would be Ford right? It has a strong commerical division, outlook for the EV development looks good, largest vehicle supplier to the government, and I heard there is crazy demand for the transit vans both commercial and for the van lifers.

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fdoomzjtxdt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d4c80c5a723b1d93ae641990055e2c92945ff80

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jkso764uxdt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce353f49c56cc33456c8e5394357d8c12c510d4a

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting.

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57.

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out. 

&#x200B;

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade.

The day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. 

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse. 

&#x200B;

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c5b3gkqfqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0102c35a2a85acc9fef190e2f194e8c285284d5a

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mymji2jgqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7450d1700fb29082bfcb0ccde34638e1f82d5157

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish. 

&#x200B;

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axbih2flqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=123ed0182bb17777310bf8eb9d01f541ff021168

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. 

&#x200B;

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz4j8manqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=85501a00d711a631528288d3e261e0acbb5213e5

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation Crypto took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. BTC broke its major support and is now below 40k and ETH broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",2022-04-12,13,10

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher on the week by 1%, a move less than the 3% move options were pricing. However, it was down by roughly 3.5% on Monday and remained volatile throughout before finishing on the highs for the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a nearly 2.5% move this week (about $11 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** – Implied volatility is less than last week but still high historically. The VIX closed Friday below near 27.5. That was down slightly from last week and down significantly from the upper 30’s it saw in the early part of last week. As mentioned last week:

>**Since the pandemic sell-off in early 2020, the VIX has spiked above the 30 level 5-6 times. Each time marked an end to that particular selloff/correction. However, on sustained selloffs (or crashes), implied volatility can go much higher.**

The spike in the VIX to the upper 30’s last was followed by a bounce in stocks but intra-day volatility was consistent even as the market finished slightly higher on the week. Therefore implied volatility remains elevated.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.5%** (about $11)
* QQQ **3.1%** (about $11)
* IWM **3.5%** (about $6)
* DIA **2.1%** (about $7)

### In the News

Bitcoin options are pricing about a 5% move into Friday. Ethereum options are pricing about a 6% move. Both of those moves are less than what was priced last week.

Full CNBC article [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/13/fords-market-cap-tops-100-billion-for-first-time-ever.html)

CEO Jim Farley, who took over in October 2020, seems to be doing right by the auto company with plans to increase production of electric vehicles. Demand for the electric version of America's most popular vehicle, the F-150 is high. Production goal already nearly doubled for the F-150 Lightning pickup to 150,000 trucks per year.

I'll share a growth options spread to mark the occasion -- The combo below accelerates gains on $F by 3.3x and make up to 29.1% (83.1% annualized) through 6/17/2022. [Link to source](https://www.oliveinvest.com/growth/4?o=61e18c99c23df95f32732ae6)

qilfi2_TSLA,TSLA,"TSLA Market Cap increased more than HMC, F, & GM total market caps combined in 4 days","Post says it all.  TSLA is now worth $1.1T after the Hertz announcement.  The market cap increased from $864B to the $1.1T in 4 days.  That's a total of $236B increase in less than a week. The four day increase alone is worth more than Ford, GM, Nissan, and Honda total market caps combined ($67B, $79B, $22B, & $54B respectively).  Four days....it increased by the size of some of the largest car producers in the US combined.  It's total market cap is nearly 5X those same companies combined (you could own each of them 5X with TSLA market cap).

All of that for a company that has less than $4b in operational income YTD, which by the way is about 8X less than the combined income generated by the aforementioned car producers.  To also put that into perspective, it is now worth more than Facebook by $150B (that's a whole AMD market cap) which has generated 10X the net income YTD.

pfupb8_F,F,"B.R.F. S.A. (BRFS) Rare Healthy Financials, Long-Term Play","The smartest investors are those who are able to weather a stock’s shorter-term volatility and focus instead on its long-term growth potential.  
   
Today’s Pick, the Brazil-based food firm B.R.F. S.A. (BRFS), is one such stock. The near-term pressures across the entire industry are intense, with input costs growing among all of the food producers, and red tape in Saudi Arabia making it more difficult for foreign poultry companies to operate there.  
   
Although a number of BRFS’ peers with similar capitalization levels are facing the identical issues, they’re priced many, many times higher than BRFS – sometimes in the triple-digits. BRFS, meanwhile, is priced at merely $4.66/share right now ($3.78B Cap)  
   
Shareholders are probably being scared off by the company’s extremely high debt levels (with the debt/equity ratio at 3.20 and long-term debt at $23 billion \[bn\] as of year-end 2020). That’s a very reasonable concern.  
   
However, it’s important to read the fine print. The maturity date on almost all of the debt is for a decade from now, and the short-term debt at around $1bn looks manageable.  
   
Because of that high debt load and 0.90 quick ratio, BRFS does not meet all of the analysis criteria. But its growth story is compelling enough that I still believe it deserves to be mentioned here today.  
   
Management has set in place what it calls its “Vision 2030” plan, with plans to reduce that debt, improve margins, and increase product diversification, targeting in particular the addition of more value-added foods to its portfolio.  
   
So far the company’s leadership has shown it’s on the right track. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 to corporations. Let’s take CEO Lorival Luz take it from here:  
   
*“The pandemic altered product demand, accentuated macroeconomic volatility, and along with other market conditions, increased the cost of raw materials (most notably for grains). However, we were resilient and agile to adapted to these changes while recording consistent and sustainable results. Despite the abovementioned challenges, our EBITDA totaled R$1.2 billion, in line with the first quarter of last year when there were no effects of COVID-19. Our net income came to R$22 million: an improvement compared to the R$38 million net loss recorded in 1Q20.”*  
   
The group also inked a promising deal with an Israeli startup that cultivates the creation of meat through cell cultures and launched 60 new brands, in addition to creating a new vice-president position to focus on leveraging diversified products like pet foods and snacks.  
   
BRFS hasn’t escaped the effects of COVID-19 entirely, however. Revenue was down 7.69% in the most recent quarter to $10.59 bn. Nonetheless, it’s also worth pointing out that the two prior quarters showed sales growth of 9% and 15%, respectively. On an annual basis, 2019 and 2020 saw revenue grow by 10.79% and 18%, respectively.  
   
The financial ratios are healthy too, with a P/E ratio of 13.62, P/S ratio of 0.49, P/C of 2.24, and P/FCF of 9.29. It’s rare to see such good numbers in a penny stock.  
   
Finally, there isn't a much better hedge against a ""financial downfall"" than a food company, especially one that sells meat. BRFS itself says there’s more meat demand coming from Asia than it knows what to do with, and short of some truly epic natural disaster taking place.  Historically, humans typically eat meat.  
   
If you struggle to be patient with your investments, then BRFS may not be for you. But if you’re willing to play the long game, and overlook the fact that higher input costs may affect the company over the next year (or time your entry accordingly), then the stock may be worth some due diligence on your part.  
   
I recommend starting with the group’s conference call. Check it out [here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428485-brf-s-brfs-ceo-lorival-luz-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript).

OK, two catalysts.

TL;DR  - FEED study came back positive, and Mysterious Bidder contacted the  company directly. Shares likely to go brrr. Price is reasonable now,  will not be later.

Y'all may recall the interest around PQEFF when an offer was placed in the [German Business Gazette](https://bundesanzeiger.de/) indicating an offer to buy roughly 47% of the company at €0.48 a share - $0.57. This was posted in this forum by  [u/kirkrikster](https://www.reddit.com/user/kirkrikster/) [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nkcfrm/pqeff_recent_newsfiling_suggests_a_10x_increase/).  There was understandable skepticism, because that was almost exactly 10  times the price that PQEFF was trading at at the time and the broker,  Uppgard Konsult AB, are primarily a forestry company.

Well, now things have changed, and two major catalysts have landed

**1. Front End Engineering Design (FEED) Study**

Petroteq  have been operating a demonstration plant in Utah for the last few  years, and using it to iron the kinks out of the process, in partnership  with Valkor Engineering out of Texas. That study was completed recently  (after the offer in Germany) and sent for 3rd party verification. That  verification has now been received by the principal, TomCo Energy, who  have [announced the results](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/TOM/receipt-of-final-feed-study-and-third-party-report/15073972).  The two details that stick out are indicative costs of $22 per bbl in a  5000 bpd plant operating 24/7/365, and the comments by the TomCo Energy  CEO

>*The  FEED study  outlines better economics for the proposed plant than we  initially  envisaged, together with verification that the proposed  technical  approach is appropriate*

Nice.  TomCo through their Greenfield partnership with Valkor are already  raising the estimated 110 million financing to build the plant.

*Edit: Rumour is that the FEED study itself will drop tomorrow. Petroteq are expected to make an announcement this week.*

**2. The Uppgard offer went live**

So  the Uppgard offer was weird on the face of it. Uppgard said they were  working on behalf of an unnamed client and the offer was only to  shareholders with more than 1million shares in Europe. It fizzled,  predictiably, after spiking the share price to $0.22 or so. However, it  didn't go away. Uppgard extended the deadline, increased the offer to  €0.5 ($0.59) per share, and engaged a [Canadian law firm](https://www.accesswire.com/655815/Uppgard-Konsult-AB-Update-on-its-Share-Purchase-Initiative-for-Petroteq-Energy-Inc-TSX-VPQE-OTCPQEFF-FSEPQCF?s=09) to begin preparing an offer for North American shareholders. As part of that process, they have made public a proof of funds showing that they can afford the share purchases.

The [real catalyst came today](http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-accesswire/2076185/petroteq-announces-contact-from-uppgard),  though, as Petroteq announced that its Securities Counsel has been  contacted by Uppgard's clients. Before a recent share offering round the  company were attempting to acquire 200 million shares which was roughly  47% of the company. After the funding round (including a quarter  million share purchase by the CEO) that will have fallen to  approximately 36-41% depending on the exercise of issued warrants.  Apparently this prompted the Mystery Bidder to contact the company  directly.

**Risks**

Petroteq recently raised \~$5MM with a fairly large dilution, although this has not really hit the share price badly.

They also had to announce [a late filing of the 10-Q](https://www.accesswire.com/655922/Petroteq-Announces-Expected-Late-Filing-of-Financial-Statements-and-Application-for-Management-Cease-Trade-Order-Cautions-Against-Reliance-on-Certain-Previously-Issued-Financial-Statements)  because of an issue around disclosure of a potential liability, and  will have to refile their last 2 years 10-K (annual reports).

The  Petroteq demonstration plant is just that, a demonstration plant. It  has been run at up to 180 bpd, and the oil sold at WTI prices, which is a  premium. While some financing is in place, the output of the plant is  not currently defraying much in the way of costs. The plan is to push  the output higher, but this has not yet occurred.

TomCo  need to raise 110m for their plant, and the appetite for this will be  dependent on oil prices remaining above $50/bbl, in my opinion.  Petroteq's revenue model is dependent on royalty payments (a hefty 5% of  the gross oil revenue) so will be limited until these plants start  producing.

Talks have been opened,  but that does not mean that talks will conclude with anything. This is a  penny stock, invest at your own risk, and beware the jabberwock!

A senior Federal Reserve official has warned the US cannot afford a “boom and bust cycle” in the housing market that would threaten financial stability, in a sign of growing concern over rising property prices at the central bank.

“It’s very important for us to get back to our 2 per cent inflation target but the goal is for that to be sustainable,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times. “And for that to be sustainable, we can’t have a boom and bust cycle in something like real estate.

“I’m not predicting that we’ll necessarily have a bust. But I do think it’s worth paying close attention to what’s happening in the housing market,” he said.

According to data released by the National Association of Realtors last week, the median price for sales of existing homes was up 23.6 per cent year-on-year in May, topping $350,000 for the first time.

Rosengren said that in the Boston property market, it had become common for cash-only buyers to prevail in bidding contests, and that some have been declining home inspections to gain an edge with sellers.

“You don’t want too much exuberance in the housing market,” Rosengren said. “I would just highlight that boom and bust cycles in the real estate market have occurred in the United States multiple times, and around the world, and frequently as a source of financial stability concerns.”

He said the roaring housing market should be a factor as the central bank considers slowing or removing some of the hefty monetary support for the economy introduced during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Fed has been purchasing $40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities per month alongside $80bn in monthly Treasury debt as part of its asset purchase programme.

Fed officials are now beginning to discuss trimming that bond buying. And Rosengren said that “when it is appropriate” to begin that process, mortgage-backed securities purchases should be reduced at the same rate as Treasury purchases. That would mean the direct support to housing finance would wind down more quickly.

“That would imply that we would stop purchasing MBS well before we stopped purchasing Treasury securities,” he said.

James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, is among those who have called for the Fed to re-evaluate its support for the housing market against the backdrop of what he noted were broader concerns about a nascent bubble.

Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed president, has also advocated for the purchases to end “sooner rather than later”, especially given mounting evidence of financial speculation in the housing market.

The Fed has said that it would begin reducing its asset purchases only once it had made “substantial further progress” towards its goals of 2 per cent average inflation and full employment.

Given the rapid recovery, Rosengren said “the conditions for thinking about whether we’ve attained substantial further progress will probably be met before the beginning of next year”.

The latest economic projections by the Fed showed central bank officials increasing interest rates from their current rock-bottom level in 2023, earlier than previously forecast. They also exposed a greater divide within the Federal Open Market Committee on the expected path of monetary policy than had been the case.

“There’s a great deal of uncertainty in the forecast,” Rosengren said. “Some people are going to have very rapid growth [and] the conditions for tightening policy may be happening sooner. And other people are going to think that the recovery is going to be a little slower.”",2021-06-28,2248,1299

will likely do this in a multiple of 20 to collect roughly $120 in premium. with this set up, the underlying could fluctuate either way roughly 8% at expiry and be completely profitable. ford went on a tear on friday and i’m expecting it to correct a bit on monday, so these numbers will shift depending on what happens in the morning. given the current numbers, the max risk is really high due to the how tall/wide the iron condor is (7.3 risk to 1 profit), but it seems like a relatively safe bet.

regardless of the underlying, anyone else making a similar move this week?

furthermore, who of y’all do some form of credit spreads on a weekly basis?

my current vibe is to make really high probability plays for pretty small profits in order to grow my account (which i’ve built up from ~5k - ~20k). 90% of my portfolio is shares of reputable companies and i want to use the remainder for reasonable options plays.

Link to my original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/n4setm/otc\_mbhcf\_a\_conglomerate\_company\_focused\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/n4setm/otc_mbhcf_a_conglomerate_company_focused_on/)

Just to rehash a little background on MBH Corp; They are a Europe-based conglomerate that acquires several smaller companies with EBITDA ranging from $1Million - $10Million, as opposed to larger acquisitions. These companies often have MASSIVE potential but investors are not likely to invest due to the risk of investing in smaller IPs. MBH acts as a bridge for small companies to big investors by allowing investors to have a stake in these companies via their equity product.

The company announced this morning the purchase of Intercity Taxi, an English taxi service with a fleet of 120 taxis and over 150 drivers. Once again these guys fit into that small company range with annual revenue of around $2M GBP. They have 40 years of experience in the business and have implemented the iCabbi system to allow for ease of ordering.

Full release can be seen here: [https://www.mbhcorporation.com/mbh-completes-its-26th-acquisition-by-acquiring-intercity-taxis-to-further-grow-its-transport-vertical](https://www.mbhcorporation.com/mbh-completes-its-26th-acquisition-by-acquiring-intercity-taxis-to-further-grow-its-transport-vertical)

n5ydyf_F,F,Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?,"Hi r/stocks,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?",2021-05-06,17,36

Though I feel the luster is wearing off. These companies all speak to an era that disrupted society. Watching (and living) through the huge change these companies brought to society was a really neat experience. They collectively changed how we function in every way today.

Facebook: Like MySpace but better! Introduced society to a social media experiment that has changed our lives and the way we connect in every way. Now there are many platforms (with less users) doing the same thing. 

Apple: Media players were all called Ipods. Smartphones were all called Iphones. Tablets were all called Ipads. They completely changed how we connect with one another and with our various forms of entertainment. They ushered in a whole new generation of technology. Their loyal fanbase is what matters and I appreciate the company for the products they produce but it seems like everyone is doing what they do nowadays (they just do it a bit better). An upgrade from 1 camera lens to 3 doesn't excite me. 

Amazon: Prime Delivery. Getting stuff to your door in 2 days. GROUND BREAKING. I got hooked and never went back. Ordering from anywhere else was unacceptable. They fed our desire for ""immediate satisfaction"" and set a standard for everyone else to meet. Their entry into smart devices was a valiant effort and their web services have taken the world by storm (whether anyone really knows it or not). Now every retailer is expected to offer free shipping at the same precedent that Amazon set years ago. Maybe they will be able to accomplish drone delivery services but there are many unforeseen complications to that. This would definitely considered ""disrupting"" society once again. 

Netflix: Mail to home service turned video streaming service. Streaming movies at your fingertips was game changing. Today there are dozens of quality companies video streaming. Exclusive content from Netflix is great. They started down that path early enough knowing that others would follow them into the streaming space but how are they changing life today?

Google: ""Google It."" When this became the generic term for looking up content you knew they won the battle. Built on a search engine that boasted NO ADS to steal away from ""ask Jeeves"" and ""yahoo"" among others they changed the simplicity of search as we know it today. 

Thinking about these companies over the last 5 years are really quite boring. They make tons of money. They still don't excite me to own them. They have gotten so huge it is actually a bit scary in some ways. I feel they will migrate out of growth and into dividend portfolios over the next 5-10 years but I could be completely wrong. 

TL;DR What companies do you believe will make up the ""BIG 5"" of the future that will disrupt the way society operates today? Or do you think that F.A.A.N.G. will succeed in disrupting our everyday lives once again?",2021-04-30,0,40
n0w9os_F,F,QQC-F or VFV?,"Hey everyone! I am a young (20) Canadian investor and recently began only a few months ago. I have been looking for a good dividend growth ETF that will also give me more diversification into the US market as I mostly have Canadian dividend stocks and would like to avoid paying the 15% fee on US earnings. I wanted a simple growth ETF that would give me at least some amount of dividend and allowing my portfolio to diversify more and have been eyeing either QQC-F or VFV.  


From what I understand the QQC-F tries to track the NASDAQ-100 Index while VFV tries to track the  S&P 500 Index. I am not too sure which is better in this regard, but I do know that VFV provides more than double the dividend compared to QQC-F (1.28% vs 0.56%). However, I am willing to lose out a bit on dividend income if it means more potential growth as I plan to hold these long term

m5kkxa_NET,NET,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

m5kkxa_PATH,PATH,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|

|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

&#x200B;

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qrj6u33337n61.jpg?width=410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a3ce983f324aa5cf18bf477a7cab5f37267c92b

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q2yma54537n61.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=668ffa44e5250d7903cecf8704c92842135bb797

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit.

50 Shares @ 230
60 shares @ 110
30 Shares @ 75

So yeah this fucking sucks a fat one for sure. Right now I have family and friends sending me constant updates of how HYPOTHETICALLY fucked I am and I’m starting to feel the panic. 

BUT! I spent the last year taking 20% gains here and there with a 10% stop loss... you know where that got me? Fucking net zero gains across the board. Quite frankly I’m embarrassed by how little I’m paying in capital gains for 2020 and I know a lot of you feel the same fucking way. 

So Riddle me this my fellow Retard Investors...

1)Why would we sell when the charts show clear manipulation?
2)Why would we sell when the number of shares changing hands has flatlined the past week?

And lastly you beautifully autistic rabble rousers! 

WHY WOULD YOU SELL FOR AN 80% LOSS! 

It blows my fucking mind how many people are giving in right now... JUST KIDDING BECAUSE NOBODY IS ACTUALLY SELLING YOU FUCKING IDIOTS(speaking directly to Melvin, Citadel, and the SEC)!  THE GME DIAMOND HANDS HAVE DECIDED TO BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES BECAUSE (SPOILER ALERT!) DFV WAS PROPPED UP BY THE COMMUNITY AND IS NOW THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE STORY AND ALLEGEDLY UNDER INVESTIGATION! The deck is stacked against us, and they have every reason in the world to pull out all the stops to FUCK YOU OVER! 

That is why this hurts so much... because we have wounded them so mortally over GAMESTOP OF ALL FUCKING COMPANIES! So you better believe they want you to feel the pain. 

Before I delete the Reddit app from my phone... let me explain the difference between us and them... 1)When we take a position, we know that there are no guarantees and if you lose, you fucking lose NO TAKE BACKS! 
2)When we get hurt, we don’t go on fucking CNBC to cry about it! We log onto WSB and post that lost porn while our wives are out fucking Chad for a dinner at red lobster! 
3)No matter how deep you are into GameStop... you will never be -$70 Billion dollars deep into GameStop!

# Take a look at $EMBI - Emerald Biosciences:

'A Biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Long Beach, California, focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of **bioengineered cannabinoid-based therapeutics** for significant unmet medical needs in global markets...With proprietary technology licensed from the University of Mississippi, Emerald is developing novel ways to deliver cannabinoid-based drugs for specific indications with the aim of optimizing the clinical effects of such drugs while limiting potential adverse events.'

# BLAH, BLAH, F*CK This - Another THC/CBD Stock! WRONG

$EMBI is classified by [Standard Industry Classification](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sic_code.asp) (SIC) as a 'Pharmaceutical Preparations' firm with code: 2834

Per information pulled on 1.12.2021 2:12 PM Mountain Standard:

""**Emerald Bioscience, Inc.** is a biopharmaceutical company that plans to develop and commercialize therapeutics from cannabinoids through our partnership with the *University of Mississippi*.'

* The University of MS has a [Carnegie](https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=176017) Classification as 'Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity.'
* The University of MS is a [US NEWS](https://www.usnews.com/search/education?q=University%20of%20Mississippi%20science%20rankings#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=University%20of%20Mississippi%20science%20rankings&gsc.page=1) ranked institution.

What About The Researchers? It is a DEEP BENCH. Recently appointed CEO Punit Dhillon. He is the 'BigTime/Big Leagues as my grandpa used to say.'

# BLAH, BLAH, F*CK This - Another THC/CBD Stock! WRONG

**Nope. Phase 1 Trials for Its Glaucoma Treatment in preparation. Yes. The odds of FDA approval, let alone Phase 1 success, is strained. Yup, like Han Solo said - 'Never Tell Me The Odds.'**

# CEO Well Versed in Tooling A Company to FLY From OTC To a NASDAQ Listing.

* Mr. Dhillon was the co-founder, CEO, and director of ONCS, a leading biopharmaceutical company developing cancer immunotherapies, where he oversaw and completed a partnership with Merck to launch a Phase 2/3 global multi-center clinical study, raised over $200 million, and up-listed the company from the OTCQB to NASDAQ.

# BALANCE SHEET - CASH FLOW: The Essence of a Companies To Continue Operations. You can FUDGE the balance sheet via Accounts Receivable and Depreciation. YOU CANNOT FUDGE the Cash Flow Statement:

As of 09.30.2021, [Emerald](https://ir.emeraldbio.life/financial-information/cash-flow) ($EMBI) has $4,229,139 in cash on the books for OPERATING Purposes. On Jan 12, 2021, the company hit a $15.8 Million Valuation (Per Ameritrade data gleaned after market close.) As such, 26.7 Cash to Equity Valuation is SHARP and POWERFUL. 'You underestimate the power of Cash Flow.' - Me.

Alright, boys n girls: Press the buttons.

YES: I Am very fond of the fact (if not proud) that I purchased shares several months ago. I did my own research. I own shares. I do not have an insider's take. I have not RECEIVED compensation. I own shares. I have NO other affiliation with the company.

While I love Schwab they don't have chart breakdowns for individual accounts so I have to show the chart for the entire Schwab portfolio.

Only about one quarter of my portfolio is options the rest is in boomer stocks.

My main option plays are mainly bought 3-6 months out and I usually sell six weeks before expiration unless it hits my limit sell. Every major play I already have an exit date and number in mind. My biggest wins have been with **NIO** and **F**. I shouldn't have to tell you this but **I only got option level 1 approval in February whereupon I lost my ass on SPCE.** Didn't start going hard on it until a couple months ago.

I do buy **FD's** with spare cash in the account but basically go into it knowing I'm losing just like I have every time playing roulette. I also have **LEAPs** in a few companies like **CVS, LUV, VIAC, Luckin, F, GE, Uber.**

The rest of my portfolio is pure boomer. All high yield dividend shit along with cruise lines and boomer companies that recently cut their dividends. These accounts I've been building since around 2014. I've made the most so far on **CAT** and **TXN**. Lost the most on big oil. **Fuck you XOM**.

I've been called an idiot for believing in the US auto industry as THE safest investment out there. As far back as the beginning of April I've been making $F calls and making money like 95%.

And yet we keep seeing on here and Twitter how the auto industry is in decline or already dead??? Or bitch if a company is from China and the ""numbers are being cooked"" yet don't elaborate on how that makes any god damn sense??? Since the worst of the COVID crash up to today, we are seeing:  
$GM = **+122%**  
$F = **+105%** and it's the SAFEST bet out of any stock on Wall Street!  
$NIO = **+1,000%**  


Oh, and no, I didn't include $TSLA because although they are EV anyone with half a brain stem can see how overvalued and thus volatile it is. Let the idiot fan boys throw their life savings for 1.5 shares. I, and the rest of us smart people, will continue buying in to companies that are affordable. We can sleep at night knowing a $GM or $F price change doesn't determine our either retiring that afternoon to a personal beach and eating out of a garbage can.

Ok so I'm looking to open a 9/25 long call on google but I dont like the amount I have to pay. So I use the long call as collateral and write a covered call expiring 9/18 After that expires I turn my long call into a credit spread by selling one call one strike below.

So now the premium you kept from selling that 9/18 call is greater than the maximum loss on the credit spread. Actually duh... thinking more about this...if it happens to moon like crazy while the short call is open then there goes my long call. Google doesn't really move so violently like tesla.

I am very new to investing and financial analysis so any input would be highly appreciated!

Here is my analysis:

1. Last 10 years GMP 91.55% ranked higher than 786 other company's in travel and leisure industry. VERY GOOD.
2. Net operating margin percentage is 15.1%(low) Typical median is around %20. This is bad.
3. Operating leverage of 3.5. VERY GOOD.
4. Financial leverage 1.75 (bad)
5. Debt to equity ratio current -6.48. Median is 1.42 (.42 higher than would like) But current is very good and especially being good during this corona virus I think this is great.
6.  Quick ratio 0.5, current ratio 1.25. 1.25:0.5. Beats a very appropriate 2:1 ratio
7. Return on equity last 12 months 60.8%. 2015-2019 average of 500.8%

Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his ""Big Short"" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options:

GOOG (36% of his portfolio)

FB (7%)

BKNG (6%)

GS (5%)

WDC (4%)

Various other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG).

Not only that, but Tencent (The Microsoft/Facebook of China) also owns a rather large percentage of NIO shares as well.

Right now the largest obstacle is getting more charging stations installed in China, which obviously can be easily remedied with time. After that, the second largest obstacle is price point. 

As someone who is Chinese and now living in the USA, when I was last in China 4 years ago, EV was just starting to get popular. Especially since that in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other provinces, you need to win a lottery in order to get license plates for your car- However if it is a Hybrid or EV, you get your license plates right away. Many of my friends would buy EV for this reason alone. 

As of now, Tesla is very popular in China, however, once better Chinese alternative starts to bear fruit, NIO is very likely to be the car that every Chinese citizen will be required to have when the government  starts to mandate “EV only” days. 


Just doing some DD and thought I’d share. I welcome those with negative and bearish outlooks on NIO (with sources) so I may further research your input. Thanks!",2020-07-16,331,71

Black owned companies are super hot right now. Why? Because their is a global protest movement, and acknowledgement from the business world that Black Lives Matter, and by extend black related causes deserve attention and funds.

You already saw the bombs going off with UONE rising faster than Americas covid-19 infection rate yesterday. UONE-K just exploded this morning and is now deflating for the moment. AMS has risen, but has more room to gas it up. Up on the Menu for the next day will be BYFC, you can expect a huge pump to come for this tonight/tomorrow pre-market.

Why? Because I've been tracking all of these for two weeks and they've all been doing the same thing, and because there is magazines, social media, and even celebrity posts pushing people to buy and invest in black owned enterprise. So not only will shares go up, these companies will likely see YUGE profit increases. Juneteenth is coming and there is plans to spend the next week focusing on black businesses. Even if you are the kind of person who doesn't care, you should know the actual conversation over the next week alone may inflate these prices.

The negative, historically Black Americans are one of the least wealthiest groups, so it could be an overestimation. But considering the Cares bucks and unemployment bonuses that have rapidly stimulated consumer investment, I think that past perception/stereotype is wrong and you would be mistake to discount the overall buying power and market impact this may have. And even if that negative stereotype rang true., Liberals who are showing solidarity will be investing, and conservatives hoping to make a quick buck and leave minorities bag holding will also try to get in now while things are still cheap.  


Dates:

Juneteenth is basically black independence day, July 10th is Black business day. August is being chosen as Black Business Month.  


Prices:

Expectation for times between 06/19-008/31 BYFC $4-$8 , AMS $5-$15, UONE $20-$40, UONE-K $5-$10.

Also, don't forget that sweet social media Karma, make a post saying you own 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 shares of black owned businesses to show your support.

The [PDF of the Borrero, Bloom, and Davis working paper](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202059.pdf)


I'll try to quote some relevant sections from the NYT article:

> “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.  Mr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic’s effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

> “Firms intend to hire these people back,” Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

>In this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.  Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

Joseph D. Piotroski works as an Associate Professor of Accounting at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

In 2000, he wrote the paper, Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Information to Separate Winners from Losers. It was this paper that outlined 9 fundamental ranking criteria for picking winning stocks.

Using his stock-picking criteria, he was able to theoretically average 23% annual gains between the years 1976 and 1996. In 2020, the annual return is down to **15%**. However, the method works extremely well after a recession with a return of **138%** in 2010.

During 2010 as the market sprang back to life, his strategy worked over 5 times better than his previous average.  Piotroski F-Score is a number between 0-9 which is used to assess the strength of a company’s financial position. The Score is used by financial investors in order to find the best value stocks (nine being the best).

fmvkkh_F,F,Covered strangle with SPY M/W/F weeklies,"6-year of stock trading/investing but fairly new to options, so thank you all in advance for your help.

For the past few weeks i've tried learning the fundamentals on options and exploring strategies for generating consistent income in a conservative way. The strategy I wanted to ask about here was  weekly covered strangles on the SPY 3x per week (M, W, F), or in other words, a covered call with a cash secured put, to capitalize on the current premiums albeit still small given the 1 day expirations.

Given the historic crash we've experienced and may continue to, I intend on scaling into a longer-term SPY position with capital to deploy further. I purchased some SPY last Friday as part of my first entry. What I thought about doing now was selling M, W, and F calls and puts every week, with the calls at +5% OTM, and the puts around -15% OTM. Both the calls and puts show a 95+% probability of expiring worthless on a consistent basis, and If I get trapped into a -15%+ (unlikely given circuit breakers, historical moves, etc) to the downside, I'm happy with bagholding another 100 shares of SPY at a time potentially a handful of times into further downside. At this point we're down almost 40% in a month and as catastrophic as people are making these circumstances out to be, it seems like a decent scaling entry point for the longer term. The weekly covered strangles + dividends would also help cost basis. My goal is to begin with 100 shares and accumulate up to 500 this year.

Quick math shows that this could generate 2-3% ROC per week (credit of about $300 selling 1 call, 1 put), and I realize I could be dead wrong and be missing something, so please advise if I am. Any experiences/thoughts/immediate red flags that jump out on this would be greatly appreciated.",2020-03-22,5,13
fl7yoh_F,F,Selling covered calls on $F or other high dividend stocks.,"I'm currently working with a small amount of capital (around 600 dollars) but wanted to try my hand at selling covered calls. 

I was strongly considering trying this strategy with Ford. I realize that they have been absolutely hammered (I am even holding puts on the $F at the moment). However, I don't think Ford will ever cease to exist. They may continue to trend down for a while, but if things ever got truly dire for them as a company, they would certainly receive a bailout. 

 They have the added benefit of having a fantastic dividend yield to grow capital with as well. I realize that the dividend has been under the microscope and could potentially be cut, but as long as it wasn't a 100% cut, then I think there would still be a lot of value in holding $F for the long run. What do you guys think? 

Are there any other stocks you would consider this a viable strategy on?",2020-03-19,3,12

bcxrw5_F,F,What will happen to my investment after my F-1 Visa expires?," 

Hi guys, so I have been doing some researches and figured out that some international students can invest with Robinhood as long as they have their SSN. However, I am concerning what will happen after they graduate and go back to their home countries. I am trying to get my SSN by working on campus but I only have like a year left until I graduate and go back to my country. Robinhood requires investors to:

* Be 18 years or older;
* Have a valid Social Security Number (not a Taxpayer Identification Number);
* Have a legal U.S. residential address within the 50 states or Puerto Rico; and
* Be a U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident, or have a valid U.S. visa\*.

So now if I have a SSN it's perfectly fine for me to invest. But when I go back, I won't have a legal residential address. May I use my relatives' house address? And will having a travelling visa after my F-1 Visa expires work for me?  
If Robinhood doesn't work out, is there any platform for international investors with minimal fees you guys would recommend? Any information or recommendation would help.  
Thanks in advance guys",2019-04-14,82,21

93pbwk_F,F,Using the Piotroski F Score as a factor,"I'm not sure if many people use the Piotroski score - its provides a rank of 0 to 9 based on the quality of a company, with 9 being the bets and 0 being the worst. I tend to use it in addition to other factors when designing strategies where it works extremely well and allows you to filter universes to high quality stocks.

It's simple yet a little painful to calculate as there are lots of factors used, which I'm guessing is one reason why you don't hear of it too often. I had always assumed another reason was that it didn't work particularly well on its own, but I've just done some research and the historical returns look pretty good:

https://preview.redd.it/mc7x2b5rohd11.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd8ebd7fba77bff2960ba358f91e042e93ba75c

The above strategy is an incredibly simple one - it selects all US stocks and DRs with a market cap over £50m and a Piotroski Score of 8 or more, then each month selects the top 10 when sorted by the Piotroski Score. The figures already include commissions and slippage of $7 per turn. I'm sure with a little tinkering it could be combined with a few other factors to create a really strong trading system.

What's better is the strategy scales well too - the above backtest was with a starting investment of $10k. If you push this up to $1m the strategy still returns a simulated 18% a year since 2000.

You can see how the strategy was put together and more performance charts and data here if you are interested - [https://investorsedge.net/Strategy/Definition/24429/23671](https://investorsedge.net/Strategy/Definition/24429/23671#)",2018-08-01,36,21
90clmm_F,F,Robinhood options f*cking sucks,"1. **Doesn't cross the spread**

You save on commissions but they don't cross the spread. So you're paying the ask and selling to the bid. So if the spread were .50 apart, you would pay $25 over what you would've paid with another broker. You're not saving anything then. Sometimes it even makes you pay .01-.02 more to even get an execution

2. **Lag is incessant**

Time between orders often takes up to 6s and sometimes the app crashes.

3. **No same day options trades**

They must've thought this was to protect users but it makes things extremely inconvenient when you're trying to close out or readjust positions expiring on that day.

4. **Treats combinations as individual legs**

If I wanted to buy and sell a spread, instead of using net debit or credit, it executes one leg at a time and then gives you your order. If premiums go up a lot, there's NO way to close out the write leg unless you happen to have a lot of $ sitting around.

5. **Buying Power doesn't display properly**

It will tell you that you have $x available, but when you try to make a trade, it'll give you a different number that you really have available.

**Conclusion**: Unless your account size is small and commissions eat into a lot of your profits, I would strongly AVOID Robinhood for options until they fix everything. 6s latency is ridiculous. I'd rather pay the commissions for immediate response time and without all these problems. The old adage is true: you get what you pay for.",2018-07-20,0,8

8i7lr1_F,F,Ford Halting F-150 production temporarily due to fire at parts supplier,"So this came to light yesterday but I didn't see it posted here.  One of Ford's suppliers had a big fire at their plant sometime last week and as a result has shutdown production.  Well that's spilled over to Ford itself and they're idling plants temporarily until it's resolved.  The fire itself took took place at a plant that produces magnesium parts and for those who don't know a magnesium fire is not a pretty event as it burns quite hot (4000 deg F vs around 1100 deg F for wood).  So it's possible it will take a while to get things back to full capacity and there's currently no ETA for when that is.

Source: https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2018/05/08/ford-f-150-production-fire-supplier-meridian/592898002/

As anyone who follows Ford knows the F-150 is their big cash cow currently.  I have to imagine they have insurance to cover these types of events but earnings might be lumpier over the next two quarters depending on when that ends up paying out and how long this outage persists for.

Edit: 

Update - Four Months to get the plant as a whole rebuilt.  Some of the plant is still working and has been reopened.

Source: https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/05/09/plant-rebuilding/594751002/

Edit 2:

Ford affirms full year guidance, working with Meridian to shift parts production to other sites but that will take at least 'several days' and there will be an impact to this quarter's earnings.  Some GM and Chrysller models are also impacted.  Tesla's parts are sourced from a Chinese subsidiary of Meridian so they aren't impacted.

Where were you all this time while drug companies were ramping prices for years? Oh wait, I remember, cheering on every good quarter these companies had. 

As for Clinton's plan:

""Clinton plans to create a drug-pricing oversight group that will monitor price increases. If this group of federal officials decides that an increase is excessive, it could take a number of enforcement actions, including making emergency purchases of an alternate version of the drug, allowing emergency imports of a similar product from other developed countries, and imposing penalties on the companies, such as fines.""

4xdmwp_F,F,Low IV - Selling Iron Condors on F.A.N.G. stocks?,"Here's something I keep hearing from time to time. While a low IV like these days is not a good environment for selling Iron Condors, it may still make sense for expensive UL like FANG (FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG). We can probably throw in SPX in the same basket here.

Basically, getting around $1.5 on $5 spread is very easy with those, and no major swings are expected. It's probably as close as one can get to 1/3 of the strikes' width today, and at least some money can be made.

This is a very interesting report on the financing arm of the automotive industry. What compelled me to post this report is the concern I've heard multiple times from different sources about the increase in sub-prime lending and increasing risk of default and/or delinquency in the automotive sector, which is their explanation of the low P/E ratios and declining share prices for such stocks as Ford (F), Toyota (T), and General Motors (GM) despite the (seemingly) good news & earnings reports coming out.

Some interesting bits to take away:

* Page 18: As the housing bubble was popping (07-09), the average loan credit scores were reaching their peek, since then, they've declined steadily during the recovery. Credit scores of loans are now approximately what they were in 2007.

* Overall, Financing seems to be more popular as a method of paying for a car (pg. 29). People are willing to pay higher amounts per month than they were previously.

* Buy Here Pay Here (BHPH), where the local dealer themselves makes the loan to the customer, is becoming much less popular.

* Page 31 & 33: Captive Auto Loans (made by the auto manufacturer themselves to the buyer, such as Ford and Toyota) have similar delinquency rates as banks. Financing companies have by far the highest delinquency rates, but the rate has come down significantly from 3Q-2014 to 3Q-2015

* Pages 32 & 34: Maps of the united states with the 30 & 60-day delinquency rates by state. The worst area: the entire Southeast region. The best areas: Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the mid-west.
