10l6zzl_GD,GD,General Dynamics has now the opportunity to permanently displace German competition in the European main battle tank market -> Long,"* GD is a fundamentally well-positioned defense contractor with a strong order book, an attractive dividend yield (consistently increased its dividend for 28 years, safe payout ratio of around 41%), and steady share repurchases (reduced the total number of shares outstanding by approximately 22% from 2012 to 2022).
* Germany has just announced that it will allow the supply of Leopard 2 to Ukraine (and that Leopards of the German Armed Forces will be delivered to Ukraine).
* The German defense industry is far from being able to replace the tanks supplied to Ukraine. The production capacity of the Leopard 2 manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann was already [stretched](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/plus238759401/Leopard-Panzer-So-gross-ist-der-deutsche-Ruestungs-Rueckstand.html) last summer.
* Even if the German government were to use the €100 billion that Mr. Scholz announced at the end of February 2022 for his ""Zeitenwende"" to increase production capacity for German tanks (which would probably be too late now), German defense industry faces a severe  [shortage](https://www.handelsblatt.com/karriere/ruestungsindustrie-von-400-kandidaten-beisst-einer-an-wen-deutschlands-waffenhersteller-gerade-dringend-suchen/28497644.html) of skilled workers.
* GD now has a unique opportunity to sell M1A2 Abrams tanks in Europe. Poland (which has 247 Leopard 2 tanks and wants to send some of them to Ukraine) has already ordered 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks in Q3 2022 and just 116 more Abrams M1A1s. [Some 2000 Leopard 2s are in service with the armed forces of 15 European countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/leopard-2-german-tanks-what-are-they-why-does-ukraine-want-them) and defense spending in the EU even [grow by 6%](https://eda.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2022/12/08/european-defence-spending-surpasses-200-billion-for-first-time-driven-by-record-defence-investments-in-2021) before Russia's war of aggression started.
* Choosing a tank model is a commitment for decades. No army can switch from one model to another overnight. Different tank models require special infrastructure, tank crews need to be trained for a particular model, and a tank model with its special features needs to be integrated into an army. This means that if GD is in, it will stay in.
* Selling a tank model generates steady revenue. In the third quarter of 2022, for example, GD earned $125 million in ""systems and sustainment technical support services"" and $40 million in spare parts for the U.S. Army's Abrams tanks.
* Selling more tanks results in more cost-effective production and therefore a higher margin. GD has already a higher profit margin (8.62%) than the sector median (6.74%). McKinsey analysts estimate that doubling the production of a main battle tank can reduce labor costs by [20% and material costs by 10%](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/public%20and%20social%20sector/our%20insights/enlisting%20productivity%20to%20reinforce%20european%20defense/the%20future%20of%20european%20defence.pdf). GD has now the opportunity to become by far the most competitive main battle tank manufacturer. In the long term, the M1A2 could become NATO's standard main battle tank.
* So I am long in GD.

u619u4_GD,GD,Bet on war $GD $LDOS,"With upcoming earning coming up for $GD and $LDOS defense stocks will skyrocket. The Ukrainian president has announced today that he is calling off the ceasefire and requesting more aid. The huge game changer for the defense sector is once earnings are reported they will provide guidance on how much money they are being allocated for these contracts. Historically defense stocks outperform the market in times of conflict. After most earnings for defense stocks come out by end of May you will see a huge rise in speculative pricing once these guidance are given.

Positions are here ! All of my positions correlate after earnings so you have an idea of the strike to look at. This will honestly only fail if the Ukraine has peace by early May which is highly unlikely as global spending on defense has never been higher in the past 10 years.

oal47j_LMT,LMT,$GD vs $LMT,"Hey guys! Looking for some advice.

I haphazardly opened up about 30 positions when I first started Dividend investing. I haven’t been happy spreading that much around to that many companies.

So I’ve trimmed down to 20 positions, and I’m looking to settle around 15.

I’ve done this by eliminating redundancies in my portfolio. Trying to focus on the strongest companies in each sector.

But when it comes to the LITERAL defense sector, I can’t really determine which company to consolidate into. I’m a big fan of both, but I’d really like to focus my investments on only one of these.

Is there a clear winner? Or should I actually keep both in my portfolio?",2021-06-30,7,13

hpvax0_GD,GD,TRXC (DD) but also (GD).,"Hey, folks. 

TRXC. Recent offering. Details here:

 [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3588882-transenterix-completes-15m-equity-offering](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3588882-transenterix-completes-15m-equity-offering) 

This stock closed Friday at .3265. At the time of offering it was hovering between .56 and .52.  Fingers crossed for eventual gap fill.

Now: the purpose of the post 

I am currently in this stock at .33 waiting on the theoretical gap fill back or any next small pump back up, but had I done just a little more DD before entering this stock I might not have bought in. Perhaps this suggestion I am about to make is beyond the goals of this subreddit, but since there are a lot of new-to-trading folks here and/or new-to- r/pennystocks I thought helping  compile some sort of document to help eliminate some of the ""oh my god what do I do"" posts might help the community better. 

We all know some pennystocks can be a little shady. Well most of us anyway, so why not create a list of tickers which are more suspect as far as manipulation goes. Yes, pennystocks are generally more prone to manipulation, but not every pennystock has businesses like Sabby Management or god knows what company that likes to short stocks playing around behind the scenes. 

a. I have played this game and been on the right side of some Sabby nonsense. 

b. I have played this game and been on the wrong side of some Sabby nonsense. 

I know I am not the only one who has learned the hard way in the past. Would it be useful to this subreddit to create an ""off limits"" list of Tickers or perhaps the better title is ""play at your own risk"" list? 

So back to TRXC. Generally speaking if I see something pop on the 13G filings then I know something ridiculous will mostly like happen in the immediate future with the price of a stock. With TRXC I looked back pretty far, but I didn't look back as far as I should have. 

This report is from 3/6/2020. Sabby gets involved with a little over 4,000,000 shares. I think we all agree if Sabby is involved in some way it is best to just stay away. I know many folks here echo the same sentiment.

 [https://sec.report/Document/0001535610-20-000079/](https://sec.report/Document/0001535610-20-000079/) 

and of course on 3/10/2020 the stock dropped about a $1. Sabby stuff. Cool. Moving on. The stock would eventually fill that gap and then go witness yourself on the graph the red candle blood bath immediately following a price pump. So yes, Sabby, but also there was opportunity. 

Now here we are in present day. 

Two more 13G's last week. 

 [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-081606/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-081606/) 

 [https://sec.report/Document/0000902664-20-002576/](https://sec.report/Document/0000902664-20-002576/) 

That's Empery Asset Management and CVI investments. Both with similar track records to Sabby. One got about 8,000,000 shares. The other got several million and some shares with warrants. I think the latter is more interesting. The price offering was on 7/1/2020. These companies filed these forms on 7/7/2020. On the same day TRXC hit 52.12M volume. The stock hit around .39, but never truly filled that gap. It is currently hovering at or around its 52-week low. I reckon I'll hang tight and watch this play out.  My position is @ .33. Don't enter unless you feel good about walking into this type of kitchen. 

So, here we are at the conclusion of this post. I realize this stuff is readily available online, but it is evident the newer crowd here has a hard time reading graphs and doesn't yet understand the amount of behind the scenes stuff that goes on concerning trading. Perhaps I have missed our resource for this, but at the very least I hope to get some conversation going on developing the subreddit and helping everyone get their s t r a t e g e r y on and make money.",2020-07-12,14,9

Strategy: Buying stock at discount price from their intrinsic value. Selling Cash Secured Put to lower my entry price. If assigned I sell Covered Call to further down my cost basis and increase my income

This kind of operation is ideal for investors and not for traders. 

Risk: Cash Secured Put is not like a selling naked put. In case of assignation ,your maximum risk is to own the stock.

Usually my minimum standard required is a 1% Monthly return) This time my AROI is 11%. Last operation was 21%. This week I stayed more conservative cause OI studies showed me some short signs.

As it is a CSP is quite clear that is not a like a selling naked put. In this case if I am assigned I am available to own the stock. Risk is quite different. This kind of operation is ideal for investors and not for traders. Your maximum risk is to own the stock. In case of assignation I start to sell Covered Call and I further down my cost basis and increase my income.

5rl6x2_GD,GD,($GD) General Dynamics Corporation,"General Dynamics Corporation operates in the aerospace and defense industries. The aerospace industry is one that has grown so immensely in the past 50 years, ever since America has landed on the moon, this industry has landed itself a star next to its name for distinction of industry. The importance of a distinction is that the industry will always be on the mind of the people and thus will not go away for a long time. The aerospace industry will see a big boost this year in bottom line. Comparing to companies such as Boeing, general dynamics is much smaller, but that is not a concern for this next year. The next year will be very prosperous for General Dynamics as companies that are tier 3 of aerospace and tier 1 will see a boost in bottom line. Aerospace is a good industry to be a competitor in because it always forces innovation and keeps the companies on their heels, thus this company will already be working on 100% efficiency, so whatever market share is available, the company will take quite easily. The defense industry is an important one this year. The President of the America will play a big role in the defense industries bottom line. So far this company has seen a seen a big bump in stock price since the Republican Donald Trump was elected. Republicans are notorious for wanting to increase defense spending and possibly bring out war. Though, Donald Trump has mentioned time and time again that he will not protect our allies so thoroughly as in the past unless they pay us. This means that there could be a potential scale back, but in the interest of this article, Donald Trump will likely increase the army size and other countries will pay us more than they do for their protection, as America's huge army finally pays off for the country after allowing it to go to extra usage every year since World War 2. This means that America will prosper in wealth from the defense industry and accordingly, the industry will see a big boost in defense contracts. The boost in defense contracts will not just increase the bottom line, but this certain line of defense contracts will provide optimism for the future of the defense industry as two things are occuring: America is benefitting big time from its defense budget, and the technological boom of the past decade is catching up to an industry that has been largely stagnant since the atom bomb in World War 2.
General Dynamics is total is a company that has significant market share in the aerospace industry and an even larger market share in the defense industry. The defense industry will shell out big bucks to the top 5 companies in the industry, and accordingly as the number 5 biggest defense company, General Dynamics will benefit immensely. This years of earnings will create optimism for the future as well and the stock price will justly increase significantly. They will take a small chunk of market share for themselves in the following year, but will remain in the fifth spot for at least the next 5 years. The company's aerospace section will benefit largely from the whole industries innovation as this will be a good year for that particularity of the industry. General Dynamics will not lose or gain market share in the aerospace industry this year, but that will not be a bad thing as they gear up for the next 10 years. The next 10 years will be a good one for this company. As stated before, the whole industry will be getting a big boost in the coming year. The company should enjoy the ride that is about to come for the entire industry. The increase in aerospace industry earnings will create optimism, which will collide with the optimist for the defense industry for General Dynamics Corporation and the company will get a significant boost solely from optimism. This company has the potential to make a name as an up and coming stock for the next 3 years.

The stock chart for the past year shows a steady climb for the first 10 months, a steep incline in the week following Donald Trump's election victory, and the steady climb after the steep incline. The steady climb for the first 10 months additionally shows a deep drop right in the middle. The steady climb is important because it shows the stock is readying up for a big run in the next year. The drop in the middle of the steady climb shows that there is still uncertainty in the stock, and thus confident people can benefit from this stock's volatility and uncertainty. The steep incline after Donald Trump's election day victory is important because it again is further proof that the company's stock price is readying up for the next year. The steady climb after the steep incline shows that the company is nearing the end of the readying period discussed before and is about the enter the period that will show a big incline and the bandwagon will jump on this stock. The stok chart for the next year will show a quick gain for the first 6 months and a plateau for the next 5 months with another steep incline in the final month.
