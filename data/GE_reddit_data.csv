CEO Larry Culp also told the Bernstein Strategic Decisions conference that the engine maker pledged to be “completely in sync” with customer Boeing, as the U.S. planemaker gradually grows production of its strong-selling 737 MAX to a monthly rate of 38 and possibly above this year. GE Aerospace, however, is still expecting a hit of more than $500 million from tariffs due to a U.S.-led trade war.",2025-05-28,25,9

    Honeywell International is trying to pull a GE, breaking up into three companies to try to unlock shareholder value.
    
    Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, also reported fourth-quarter numbers on Thursday. The earnings were solid. Guidance, however, was below Wall Street estimates.
    
    Investors undoubtedly will pay attention to the 2025 outlook, but more importantly the portfolio actions the company announced.
    
    Honeywell laid out plans to break apart into three companies: One dedicated to automation, one to aerospace, and another to advanced materials.
    
    Automation is the largest business, with about $18 billion in annual sales. Aerospace revenues is in the range of $15 billion. Advanced Materials is the smallest business, with about $4 billion in annual sales.
    
    The breakup idea appears to be inspired by activist fund Elliott Investment Management, which suggested the idea in November. Elliott might have drawn inspiration from General Electric. CEO Larry Culp’s plan to split GE into three companies: GE Aerospace 
    GE, GE Vernova,and GE HealthCare Technologies, arguably created hundreds of billions in shareholder value.
    
    One way breakups generate value is simply by valuation multiple arbitrage. Honeywell stock trades for about 21.5 times 2025 EPS guidance. Many more focused peers trade for higher multiples. GE Aerospace stock trades for about 38 times. Rockwell Automation, another automation player, trades for about 28 times.
    
    DuPont, another advanced materials company, trades for about 18 times. Its low multiple is one reason it plans to spin off its electronics business in late 2025.
    
    “The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies,” said Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur in a press release. “We will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value. We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business.”
    
    The second part of his statement shows that Kapur is aware of “deal limbo” risk—the risk that Honeywell stock gets stuck while investors wait for the spins to approach.
    
    The advanced materials spin is slated to wrap up in late 2025 or early 2026. The separation of the remaining automation and aerospace business should be done by the second half of 2026.
    
    It’s a big undertaking. Kapur is betting it will be best for investors in the long run.
    
    Meanwhile, for the fourth quarter, Honeywell announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.47 from sales of $10.1 billion. Wall Street was looking for per-share earnings of $2.32 and sales of $9.8 billion, according to FactSet.
    
    
    Management expects 2025 earnings to land between $10.10 and $10.50 a share. The midpoint of $10.30 is below analysts’ current projection of $10.92. The midpoint of sales guidance is $40.1 billion, below analysts’ current projection of $41.3 billion.
    
    The guidance looked light. That might divert some of the attention away from Honeywell’s transformation plan.",2025-02-06,60,13

Obviously we need to make the change from her ownership into mine , wich in in the process of doing.  

I'm really new to stocks and buying crypto and I'm trying to understand the amount of shares that are owned in wich companies since GE did a stock split a few years back. 

I've already spoken to who I need to speak with at ge shareholders customer service. 

What I'm not fully understanding is the stock split.

Right now I have roughly 275 shares in general elecric.. 

I need to fill out some documentation to make the split since my mom failed to doso when needed.

General Electric split into

General Electric aerospace 

General Electric vernova

And 

General Electric Healthcare 

My question are:

With it being an 8 to 1 split , I divide the 275 by 8 and that gets me what I have in aerospace,  then divide that by 3 for Healthcare and 4 for Vernova?

Do i still retain 275 shares in general Electric? Or is general Electric gone? 

When i check stock prices there's 4 profiles for general Electric 

General Electric 

General Electric aerospace 

Vernova and Healthcare. 

It seems that we took a huge loss if all we retain is what is after dividing .

Can someone please help me understand this better.

1ff5re9_GE,GE,Microsoft hires former GE CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe as new operating chief ,"Microsoft told employees on Thursday that it has hired Carolina Dybeck Happe as its executive vice president and chief operating officer, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Dybeck Happe comes from GE, where she was senior vice president and chief financial officer from 2020 until September 2023.

The appointment reflects Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring it remains coordinated as so much of the company has become oriented around artificial intelligence.

She will join Microsoft’s senior leadership team alongside finance chief Amy Hood, cloud and AI engineering leader Scott Guthrie and other executives.

“Carolina will partner with the SLT to help us drive continuous business process improvement across all our organizations and accelerate our company-wide AI transformation, increasing value to customers and partners,” Nadella wrote in a memo to employees.

Nadella said Dybeck Happe will take over Guthrie’s commerce and ecosystems organization, the Microsoft Digital IT team under Office software leader Rajesh Jha and the Microsoft Business Operations unit in the finance department.

Dybeck Happe’s appointment comes months after GE’s aviation and energy businesses, known as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova respectively, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE announced plans to split into three companies in 2021.

GE CEO Larry Culp called Dybeck Happe “a high-impact executive” when GE announced in 2019 that it had picked Dybeck Happe to replace Jamie Miller as chief financial officer.

She joined GE from Maersk, where she had been finance chief. Before that, she spent almost 17 years at Swedish lock company Assa Abloy, where she became chief financial officer and deputy CEO.

Microsoft has not had an operating chief since 2016, when former Walmart executive Kevin Turner left.

11rv9ar_GE,GE,Charles Schwab and GE,"Alright gather round little regards.

I'm not going to lie to you. Charles Schwab is my brokerage. But let me tell you all the story of general electric in 2008.

In the early 2000s GE made their money mostly through GE capital which was their finance and lending arm. They leveraged the good name of GE and the manufacturing arm to build a truly sizable lending program. That all fell apart doing the 2008 financial crisis Aland they had bad loans on their books for years and years after the fact and ended up having to secure funding from Warren Buffett himself.

History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes.

Charles Schwab is currently and has been moving more and more into the investor checking and other investor lending programs. Using their brokerage good will and name as their backdrop. Personal example: Over the last 10 years I've gone from using just their brokerage account to now having checking and other related accounts with them. While the investor checking and other banking functions are a small portion of their business, I'm fearful at this point that they did not properly invest their banking funds and it could might pull the entire business down.

Between Schwab and credit suisse we're staring down the next domino's to fall and see how they get sorted out.

Credit suisse is a wild card we don't know how the swiss will back up their bank, and it won't look good or feel good to the tax payer if we do it for them.

10adzfu_GE,GE,GE - GEHC spin off caused NS option,I had sold a June 2023 covered call on GE at an $85 strike. Since then they spun off GEHC so the contract has became non standard. It is now for 100 shares of GE and 33 shares of GEHC. GE is trading at ~$78.80 (out of the money) but the value is -221%. (Sold for $6.06/share now $19.50/share). My question is if the main GE stock stays below $85 will I retain my shares or do I have to average in the 33 shares of GEHC to the value of the contract as well? Just trying to understand this better. Hope this makes some sense. Thanks in advance.,2023-01-12,1,3

Says it's worth 100 shares of GE and 33 shares of GEHC no cash in lieu of shares. What are my options with this? Not sure if I can sell it. Should I exercise and take the shares? maybe sell everything to get the $$$? I'm +$1600 on it, just not sure how to handle this situation. There will also be more spinoffs from GE so I'm wondering if I should just hold on for the ride and cash in later?",2023-01-10,26,8

Industrial free cash flow was $1.7 billion, while the estimates of two analysts surveyed by FactSet ranged from $670.0 million to $1.07 billion, with an average of $870.5 million. For 2021, the company narrowed its guidance range to $3.75 billion to $4.75 billion from $3.5 billion to $5.0 billion.

*Healthcare:* The healthcare industry is the most profitable in the U.S. The Biotechnology industry is ranked #6 in the U.S for the highest net margin (24.6%). Major pharmaceutical companies are ranked #4 in the U.S for the highest net margin (25.5%). Generic Pharmaceutical companies rank #1 in the U.S for the highest net margin (30%). \[Source\](https://bluewatercredit.com/ranking-biggest-industries-us-economy-surprise-1/)

*Aviation:* The aviation industry took a big hit during COVID-19. This created the perfect opportunity for new companies to enter the market which will cause increased levels of competition.

*Power/Energy:* There has been a lot of debate regarding fossil fuels and renewable energy. “The U.S Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative aims to reduce the price of solar energy 50% by 2030, which is projected to lead to 33% of U.S. electricity demand met by solar and a 18% decrease in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” An increase in U.S oil prices has shifted investors’ attention towards the renewable energy market. \[Source\](https://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-renewable-energy-factsheet)

**Competitors**

* Siemens (SIEGY)
* 3M (MMM)
* Emerson (EMR)
* United Technologies (RTX)
* Philips (PHG)
* Schneider Electric (SBGSY)

**Digital Transformation Failure**

This is some old news but it is important to understand what went wrong. In 2015, General Electric created a subdivision called GE Digital. They hoped to dominate the industrial internet. However, GE was slow to digitally transform. Most companies transformed in the ‘90s and mid-2000. GE dumped billions of dollars into this project and appointed thousands of employees to oversee the transformation. So where did they go wrong? GE moved away from its core business and spread its resources too thin. They focused on quantity instead of quality. Well-knownGE’s companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google who dominate the tech industry, made it hard to compete.

**Porter’s Five Forces Model**

1. *Threats of New Entrants*
   1. Increased competition in the aviation industry
   2. Barrier to Entry (Healthcare): Regulation from HIPAA and FDA
   3. Barriers to Entry (Renewable Energy): Lack of infrastructure, fewer government subsidies compared to fossil fuels
   4. The overall threat of new entrants is weak due to the high cost of entry
2. *Supplier Bargaining Power*
   1. GE has an extensive list of suppliers which can be found \[here\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))
      1. The most notable suppliers are: 3M (MMM), Honeywell International (HON), Boeing (BA), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)
      2. A lot of these suppliers products overlap with each other, meaning, GE has many options
3. *International Competition*
   1. Competition is stiff from companies like Siemens and 3M
4. *Threat of Substitutes*
   1. There are few substitutes in the market so the threat is minimal
5. *Customer Bargaining Power*
   1. GE has a wide range of customers which can be found \[here\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))
      1. The most notable suppliers are: Dish Network (DISH), Emerson Electric (EMR), Honeywell International (HON), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Boeing (BA), ABB (ABB), Honda Motor Co. (HMC)
      2. It is interesting to note that a couple of GE suppliers are also GE customers

**Technical Analysis**

General Electric formed a Head and Shoulders pattern starting on June 17, 2021, and ended on July 15, 2021. This pattern was soon followed by a breakdown. Since then, the stock has been operating in a horizontal channel with resistance at $107 and $98. Look to enter the market around the lower resistance mark. We’d also like to highlight the month of March. There was a lot of positive news during March which explains the increase in GE share price. Reference the timeline for more information.

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GE/VhBEziuC-General-Electric-GE-TA/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GE/VhBEziuC-General-Electric-GE-TA/)

**Bullish Case**

* Green Movement/Carbon Neutrality (Aviation/Energy industries)
* CEO Larry Culp driving down debt and liabilities 
* Lack of substitutes in the market

**Bearish Case**

* Digital Transformation Failure
* Stiff Competition (*Siemens* and 3M)
* Healthcare Industry Regulation
* Lack of infrastructure in Energy Industry

**Conclusion**

General Electric has struggled these past 5 years which is partly due to the digital transformation failure. GE spread its resources too thin and moved away from its core business. GE could have been more profitable if they focused on developing their money makers in the Healthcare, aviation, and energy industries. That being said, GE is now focusing more on those industries. GE’s acquisition of BK Medical is a big step in the right direction for healthcare profit. Aside from that, the new GEnx jet engines are quite impressive. The increased fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions are attractive to customers amid the growing global commitment to reach carbon neutrality. GE has been known to create terrific jet engines. Back in WWII, their J-47 engine dominated the skies. If you look up the best/most popular jet engines in history, you’ll find out they were made by GE. GE has been making some major moves in the renewable energy industry. Most recently in the wind power sector. Emphasis on global carbon neutrality will have a positive impact on General Electric in the future. CEO Larry Culp is committed to driving down debt and liabilities. Long Term Debt debt has decreased by 45% in five years and Total liabilities have decreased by 32% in five years. In order to drive down these numbers, the CEO has slashed dividends. If you’re looking for a similar company with a higher yield dividend, we suggest you look into United Technologies (3.37%) or 3M (3.26%). Despite General Electric's performance these past 5 years, we believe that GE can bounce back...If General Electric focuses on its core business (Healthcare, Aviation, and Energy), it will be very profitable.

p25je0_GE,GE,The GE reverse stock split and what it means for the future of the company.,"So first time posting in stocks so I'll try not to break any rules. Also sorry for the length, spelling, Grammer, and ramblings. 

With that being said as the title suggests I am very curious on what I should do here. I own stock in GE. 

GE was just the 5th company ever on the S&P 500 to do a reverse stock split. (1for8). 

That's usually bad when a company does that.

I bought back a few years ago and since then I am now down 51% overall. So do I dump the stock and try to save my ass. Do I hold based on the fact I can just hold it for the next 30-40 years and ride it out (in my IRA). OR DO I DOUBLE DOWN since GE seems to really be turning itself around.

I had a lot of confidence when I first bought GE that they were turning around, but maybe this is it? Buffet dumped GE in 2017 and said they needed to focus up. I do like that they said they are going to focus efforts on just 4 major sectors and all future oriented IMO.

 healthcare, aviation, power, and renewable energy. 

Aviation is where they are big but healthcare too.. but I feel like power and renewable can be big for them over the long run and if done right.

Year over year they have been paying their debt off and focused on those 4 areas. They also just had a good second quarter in June and seem to really be improving.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).",2021-05-27,53,54

**Product:**

The company designed a coil driver and is able to switch coil configurations in an electric motor. For those who don't know what that matters, it gives you the opportunity to switch in your motor performance. This results in their case in a 2 speed electric motor. Whereas all electric motors used currently only are single speed.

You can see it as **an electric gearbox** \- which solves problems in **efficiency**:

1. No gears are necessary anymore- **Gears produce mechanical friction losses** and thus reduce efficiency
2. For simple motor configurations like an electric bike or electric motor cycle a single speed suffices as they usually don't drive high speeds, with this configuration even for these applications more efficiency can be squeezed out of the motor as you have **multiple operation modes of your electric motor**. Peak efficiency can typically be found somewhere half way max peak speed and max torque. Because you have multiple top speeds and top torque output you can then switch in peak efficiency dependent on how fast you want to drive.

**Current situation:**

Their company is in pre-revenue state, they have just validated their first product (the one that is applicable to electric motor cycles). They will be coming with **models up to 800V** which is industry standard in **Electric Vehicles and think also suitable for trucks.** They are planning to go in **production Q4 2021 to Q1 2022** with their first product.

**Market & Marketing:**

The **technical addressable market** for this is expected to be around **34B in 2025** and tech always comes with high margins especially a motor inverter (their electric gearbox) that is (if finished) just printing a circuit board and putting it inside a housing, test and sell.

They have **filed for around 40 patents** of which 18 are accepted and given the importance of cost efficient driving I think the company is poised for growth especially with their team of expertise.

The company got hit by a (IMO very weak) **short report** which the company wrote a **strong response** to. Which gives the opportunity to step in on a cheap level.[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exro-response-to-false-and-defamatory-report-301241067.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exro-response-to-false-and-defamatory-report-301241067.html)  
Also they came up very shortly after that with a **successful integration** of their first product with **Heinzmann**.  
[https://www.exro.com/news/exro-to-commercialize-system-solutions-with-heinzmann-motor-integration](https://www.exro.com/news/exro-to-commercialize-system-solutions-with-heinzmann-motor-integration)  


**Heinzman delivers motors to KTM** for their enduro E bike :

Motor Catalog - Page 9 “KTM, the market leader for electric motorbikes, has used the HEINZMANN PMS 120 to motorise its Enduro ,,Freeride"". The water-cooled electric motor delivers a peak output of 16 kW (22 hp) and a torque of 42 Nm from a standstill. In other words: with a weight of just 111 kilos, the motorcycle gets off to an utterly flying start. Pure riding pleasure – without the noise and emissions.”

**The KTM is comparable to a combustion 125ccm bike.** If you take a look at KTM's website for the 2021 Model they use the same imagery. [Scroll to the drivetrain section:](https://www.ktm.com/en-int/models/e-ride/freeride/ktm-freeride-e-xc2021.html)

**Risk:**

1. The biggest risk is of course a non sellable product, product might simply not be interesting enough for companies or they may want to do it themselves. (Patents hopefully protect them against copycats and it takes quite some knowledge & time to make a dynamic coil switching inverter)
2. They may run out of cash. (generated 40 Million in a funding round so should be fine)
3. May not be able to execute on their plan  for any reason.
4. Its not a nasdaq listed company and small cap, this brings always certain risks.

**Personal opinion:**

I love this company as I have designed an in-wheel electric motor myself once and worked with 2 types of motor inverters. I think this is 100% doable, given that they choose their electric components and switching strategy (coil switching) wisely. Given that they have a team with several PhD'ers in the power electronics field and an A team board and executive team I am behind their project. Also they are well funded and have multiple patents outstanding, they want to up list and have multiple strong connections in the field they are working with, also multiple arrangements with companies (see other DD below) whom are really interested and currently validating EXRO's technologies, hence there is commitment from the industry. I personally love the KTM connection with Heinzmann as KTM is one of the world's leading producer of crossmotors which also makes loads of regulars motors, whom haven't been replaced yet with electric motors. Which I think this will be perfectly suitable to.

If you want more extensive knowledge on the company there is a really big DD out there on the Exro subreddit:

ma3ggm_GE,GE,$GE DD and Research,"Hello, everyone.

This is my first DD that I have researched, and my worst nightmares are confirmation bias, so I would love to share it with the community and see what you think.

There has been no time in my investing journey that I have even thought about touching $GE… when I began to trade, their income and revenues were down the crapper, their debt was overloaded, the stock was plummeting for times before that. Honestly, I thought they were heading the route of Sear’s, where they just would vanish or be bought out by another company.

But they haven’t… recently, things have started turning around.

On their most recent 10-K, they have stated that they are [turning a profit](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000040545/000004054521000011/ge-20201231.htm). They went from losing $4 billion dollars to earning $5 billion dollars in 2020. Not only that, but in 2019, they went from losing $22 billion dollars to losing that $2 billion dollars.

In addition, for most earnings guidance for next quarter, [analysts are marking the earnings guidance higher for $GE consistently over time](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GE/earnings/).

Sure, yeah, earnings are earnings and this information is maybe/already priced in. [BUT, recently, they just merged with a company called AerCap](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/general-electric-aercap-aircraft-leasing-merger.html), valued at around a $30 billion dollar deal, which is going to be used to wipe out some of their existing debt. In addition, it would be ridding itself of a cash-sucker, as it recently lost around $786 billion dollars. Yikes, and good play.

This is all making much more sense to me, because of the CEO change to Lawrence Culp. We can see, real time, that he is lifting this company from the dumps of hell. And if the profit next quarter can remain positive, I think we can see a real change in the stock price’s value.

For around 77 million shares shorted, and a middling price at around $13/share, I think it would be a worthy investment. I mean, with all of these stats, why isn’t this stock just jumping to the moon?

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

### [Big, sexy windmills:](https://renewablesnow.com/news/ge-installs-12-mw-wind-turbine-prototype-in-rotterdam-673053/) (click to see picture)

> October 18 (Renewables Now) - GE Renewable Energy has installed the prototype of its 12-MW Haliade-X offshore wind turbine at the port of Rotterdam, the General Electric (NYSE:GE) unit said on Thursday.

### Very Electric

> According to the manufacturer, a 12-MW turbine can generate 67 GWh annually, or enough electricity for about 16,000 European homes, and avoid up to 42 million ~~tonnes~~ **kg** of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(edited to reflect error pointed out in comments). The first orders for the new machine have already been placed, coming from SSE Renewables and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) for the Dogger Bank offshore complex in the North Sea. Also, Denmark’s Ørsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED) has selected the Haliade-X turbine for the 120-MW Skipjack project off Maryland and the 1.1-GW Ocean Wind complex off New Jersey.

kn6iy2_GE,GE,"Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps"," So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide ""**must have**"" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post

\----

TL/DR: 

**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any ""green"" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \*\*rich\*\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** 

\-----

I am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. 

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. 

2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. 

3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. 

4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. 

5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.

6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes

7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. 

8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google ""U.S. HVDC Map"" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_HVDC\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. 

9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. 

10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. 

11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_Lawrence\_Culp\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. 

If you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** 

I'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio. I encourage you all to pick up at least a few cheap 2022 GE Leaps. I'm buying the furthest out, highest strike calls I can get.",2020-12-30,290,181

jywvvi_GE,GE,"Unusual Option Activity Summary for the week: GE, LB, TEAM, RTX, USFD, FANG, HALO, YETI","Swaggy is back with some unusual options activity that was spotted last week. We’ll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.

In addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).

&#x200B;

**USFD - US Foods Holding Group**

https://preview.redd.it/giioup9t1t061.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c3c2335776dd8c2880c6839c80109116e243c8

Some unusual option flow has surfaced in USFD, an unusual ticker to begin with that doesn't generally have much option volume roll through it. Last week we saw some call buying for December 18 expiration at the $35 strike. The stock has been consolidating for some time based on the chart, is it time for a break-out?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LB - L Brands Inc**

https://preview.redd.it/5vr4fgxt1t061.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de6cb0535000ba8c7a1e50fd82bf5f7e319a535

LB shot up last week and saw some heavy bullish option flow come through the tape. Big time call-buying for 2021 expirations, so somewhat mid-term plays here. LB posted good earnings last week and looks like players are looking to ride the momentum to new highs. The stock is up about 20% just last week.

&#x200B;

**TEAM - Atlassian Corp**

https://preview.redd.it/t91i1mgu1t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5a165c2df9531c6bddd71022d3b55db750cc44e

Absolutely huge call-buying in 2021 expirations and some 2022 LEAPs. Most strikes were somewhat in-the-money indicating the options contract will act more closely to share price and less of a YOLO. Nonetheless we saw some multi-million dollar positions come through betting that the stock will out-perform in the 6 months to 1 year. Interesting plays here.

&#x200B;

**RTX - Raytheon Tech**

https://preview.redd.it/b04laqz12t061.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=06db43eecfbe6499f7581bf2c5f13200780b9ae4

Another unusual ticker to be receiving such heavy call volume hit the tape. Last week a player bought 16,000 call options expiring in June 2021. The strike price was 20% OTM at the time, this is a pretty FKn big YOLO. I will be following this stock to see what catalysts might come out.

&#x200B;

**YETI - Yeti Holdings**

https://preview.redd.it/nyikkkt22t061.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43990ee4c4b492c4061daa13ed3c7fcafdaa491

Some put-selling came through YETI ticker last week. Multiple positions which included a position of 8k contracts puts SOLD to open. The stock has been on a steady up-trend ever since covid and the player is expecting the trend to continue into the Holiday season. 8,000 puts sold at $50 strike for December 4 expiration. If the stock stay above $50 (currently at $61), the player will collect $450k in premium.

&#x200B;

**FANG - DiamondBack Energy**

https://preview.redd.it/yu1zqww32t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=724a51fe870d4adc7768bd02f5ebc45f9faba374

This energy stonk has been beat up since covid hit and hasn't rebounded at all. Looking at the chart it's been in the $25-40 range for 6 months without much growth. Some call buying with mid-term time-frames came through last week in Dec 18 and Mar 19, 2021 expirations. Each play was between 3-5k contract a piece and the $45 strike was the favorite here which is sitting at about 15% OTM. This name has seen some heavy buying into since November and will be interesting to watch.

&#x200B;

**HALO - Halozyme Therapeutics**

https://preview.redd.it/tnoywxd42t061.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=19254d3525347e7507a6fab88b10e6d51af80de5

Halo has shot up 50% just in the last month of trading and has seen some explosive growth.  A ticker that rarely sees even a few hundred contracts come through saw a couple plays in the 1,000s of contracts last week. This is pretty unusual considering the open interest for most strikes and expirations is less than 80-100 per strike. So these plays of over 1,000 contract definitely stand out. Looks like players are betting on the stock to go above $44 by December 18, 2020, a relatively short-term play that would make WSB proud.

&#x200B;

**GE - General Electric**

https://preview.redd.it/p210ui752t061.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec919f5bea611428d6e5dacea856caa4a77e74e

Last week unusual call buying swept through. With nearly all the plays expiring mid-2021. An absolutely amazing 100k call contracts were traded at the June 18, 2021 expiration and $10 strike. Also looks like 100k put contracts were traded on the Jan 15, 2021 contracts with $8 strike. Tough to say if these plays are related with the same player. Most of the option flow outside those two big plays was leaning to the bullish side.",2020-11-22,305,46

2. This shows how the Alphatrends anchored VWAP acted as a level of interest for sellers in mid-July which proved to be a resistance zone.
3. This shows confluence of both anchored VWAP and the anchored volume by price supply zone or ""volume shelf"" above. This area is called a ""supply zone"" because when the price is below this area, anyone holding shares at the highlighted price level (in red) would have been down, possibly becoming sellers once they breakeven, which is what happened here, creating excess supply, moving price down.
4. This shows a ""volume gap"" in price. Notice how the price was able to move through this area quickly intraday on August 11th shown by the which. It then tags the supply zone above and immediately drops.",2020-08-13,3,0

i08m8u_GE,GE,Long-term thoughts on GE?,"Hey guys, 

Some newbie questions for you guys! I wanted to know what your long-term thoughts were on GE! The future direction of GE seems somewhat murky to me. At one, their new cost-cutting measures by slimming down seems rather good, by focusing on what makes them money and getting rid of things that burn cash.  At the same time, I see a hard recovery to their original levels with everything going perfectly,  and their ability to compete with the other players in their respective fields as well as their innovations. I don’t know, just trying to get a better picture from others that know more. 

&#x200B;

1. Do you see it going back to the levels it once was - not just share wise, but as the dominant player in the market/s?
2. If it survives this crash - and I think it most definitely will, where/how do you see it in 10 years? Is there a specific field where they will come out on top?
3. Thoughts on management and the effects of their cost-cutting measures!
4. What is the Achilles’ Hill for GE? That is, what will give them trouble - not just now, but in the future?

Thanks guys!",2020-07-29,3,13

fcc6tk_GE,GE,"Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of GE, dies at 84","Jack Welch was a railroad conductor’s son who rose to chairman and CEO of General Electric.

During the 20 years he led the conglomerate, its market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion.

Fortune magazine once called him “manager of the century,” but he also was known as “Neutron Jack” for slashing tens of thousands of jobs.

Jack Welch, a railroad conductor’s son who became chairman and CEO of General Electric and led it for two decades, growing its market value from $12 billion to $410 billion, has died. He was 84.

His death was announced Monday by his wife, Suzy.

With a determination to win by busting up bureaucratic complacency, Welch earned two titles — “manager of the century,” and “Neutron Jack” for slashing tens of thousands of jobs. Under his leadership, GE became the world’s most valuable company, after Microsoft. Its fortunes later turned south.

While at the helm, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting. GE Capital Bank was founded seven years into his tenure. His acquisitions included RCA — then-owner of NBC — and Kidder Peabody, the brokerage that became entangled in an insider trading scandal.

He also streamlined the conglomerate’s bloated bureaucracy by giving managers free rein to make changes they deemed beneficial to the bottom line.

He invented the “vitality curve,” in which managers were ranked into three groups. The top 20% “A” group was “filled with passion, committed to making things happen.” The “vital” 70% “B” group was essential to the company and encouraged to join the A’s. Then there was the bottom 10% “C” group. “The underperformers generally had to go,” Welch said in his 2001 book, “Jack: Straight From the Gut.”

According to the book, “the workforce went from 411,000 to 299,000 during his first five years as chief. With such cuts, he acquired the derisive moniker named after the neutron bomb, which was designed to kill multitudes without destroying cities.

Welch retired from GE in September 2001, days before the 9/11 attacks. Upon his retirement, The New York Times published an editorial that gushed over his professional record.

“Mr. Welch was a white-collar revolutionary, bent throughout his career at G.E. on championing radical change and smashing the complacency of the established order,” the editorial said. “His legacy is not only a changed G.E., but a changed American corporate ethos, one that prizes nimbleness, speed and regeneration over older ideals like stability, loyalty and permanence.”

For GE, the accolades turned to disbelief over the next decade and a half. Welch’s hand-picked successor, Jeffrey Immelt, had to grapple with an era that included the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the Great Recession. As the company’s fortunes evaporated, Immelt had to shed NBCUniversal and most of the once-too-big-to-fail GE Capital. He resigned in 2017.

GE would get two more CEOs, John Flannery, who lasted a little more than a year and saw the company removed from the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average after 110 years, and Lawrence Culp Jr., who has been in charge since fall 2018. As of Monday, GE’s stock was trading around $11 a share and its market capitalization was down to $95.1 billion.

The house that Jack built — a sprawling global conglomerate that encompassed diverse parts including industrial manufacturing, entertainment, technology, finance and health care — fell out of fashion with investors, in favor of more focused enterprises.

“Did the Jack Welch Model Sow Seeds of G.E.‘s Decline?”’ a headline in the Times read after Immelt’s resignation.

“It’s always tough to follow a legend,” New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran said in that Times article.

After leaving GE, Welch became a business consultant, engaged in public speaking and TV appearances, including on CNBC, wrote a column and books and opened a for-profit management institute.

A staunch Republican, he accused President Barack Obama’s economics team of cooking the books on employment data a month before the 2012 presidential election. The Labor Department reported that unemployment had fallen below 8% in September for the first time since the Great Recession.

On Twitter, Welch blasted the data.


“I wasn’t kidding,” Welch told The Wall Street Journal later that day.

Survivors include his third wife, the former Suzy Wetlaufer, whom he married in 2004. He filed for divorce from his second wife, Jane, after reports surfaced that he was having an extramarital affair with journalist Wetlaufer. Four days before the divorce trial was to begin, Jack and Jane Beasley Welch reached a settlement that reports said was worth $180 million. He divorced his first wife, Carolyn, the mother of his four children, in 1987.

- Option A (Lump Sum Payment):  $38k (payable 12/1/19)
- Option B (Early Monthly Payments):  $161 / mo (beginning 12/1/2019)

- Marital Status:  Married 
- 401k:  $210k

(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co.’s gaping pension deficit certainly stands out for its size. But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement.

All across corporate America, underfunded pensions have become the norm. Even now, a decade after the financial crisis, the largest plans face a shortfall of $269 billion, right about where it was 10 years ago. Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market. Companies haven’t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy.


Defined benefit plans, like your traditional corporate pensions, have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401(k)s. Employers can opt to contribute to those plans, but it’s the employees who are responsible for choosing the right investments and are solely on the hook if those investments fare poorly.",2019-10-09,121,10

ctvbem_GE,GE,cut my losses on GE FORD and Kraft? stocks held in an inherited account.,"Inherited account of 25 or so various stocks and funds from a family member passing, migrated it over to a taxable account and i have been sitting on the account for a few years. Sold a few things here and there converting it to a combo of VTSAX and VTIAX. All new money dumped into this account go to those 2 index funds.

But i am not sure what to do with these 3. (from reading here they come across as stinkers at the moment) totaling a 6400$ loss combined with Kraft being half of that. Do i just ditch em and use to offset future gains? or just sit on em. i am not loyal to any of these, and if i had money today i wouldn't buy them individually. Part of me says let em ride as it wasn't my money in the first place and these are big name companies, but i am not an investing professional so i stick to just dumping into index funds.

This account is going towards retirement funds so everything is 25yrs out till i plan to touch it.

any advice, thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: THANK you everyone for all the advice, i was not expecting so much response..   i think i will sit on kraft and ford, and probably dump GE later on.  I know it isn't a ton of money i am talking about, but i learned alot from all the insights in the comments, and i appreciate the input.",2019-08-22,169,127
csx5l5_GE,GE,A thesis on what’s going to happen to GE... They’re fucked.,"Marcopolos is a credible fraud investigator.

Marcopolos is employed by a hedge fund

Marcopolos has much more dirt on GE

The hedge fund is going to take down GE over and over by releasing more dirt, they already made a shitload of $ from the initial allegations, they wait for GE to defend itself, price stabilizes and even may go up, hedge fund coordinates Marcopolos dropping bombs and their positioning of FD’s for maximum return.

The formula:

Take GE down after puts secured & Marcopolos releases initial allegations.

Buy calls as the market normalizes and investors jump back in

Take down GE again with Marcopolos releasing more evidence/allegations.

Repeat.

This is fucking genius on the hedge fund’s part, they’ll ride GE into the dirt.",2019-08-20,397,307
csfs9k_GE,GE,GE junk credit rating?,"I've been largely uncertain of the claims of fraud brought against $GE and haven't cared all that much, but have been seeing more articles with regards to it's credit rating recently. Being the Autistic intraday trader I am I don't care all that much for credit ratings as a metric, however once $GE hits junk bond status (not to far, currently sitting at 2 or 3 grades above junk depending on rating company) a huge chunk of ETF's, mutual funds and just about everything else that holds General Electric stock will be forced to dump shares.

Most of these ETF's and funds are passively managed and adhere to guidelines that prohibit holding shares of companies with poor credit ratings. Considering just over 5.3 Billion (~61%) outstanding shares of GE are controlled by institutional holdings, that could represent a huge outflow and decreased demand which will drive the price even lower. Regardless of whether the SEC or DOJ is quick to act on the alleged fruad (unlikely) Moody's, Fitch, and many others are likely pouring over past financials and looking to reissue a statement of credit. I think the play moving forward is to long puts over a longer term basis and wait for their credit rating to dip. What's nice is that the report doesnt even have to be acknowledged by any acting government agency, just the speculation of accounting fraud on even a small scale could send credit ratings tumbling and have harsh effects. Regardless of whether the report holds any real meaning, GE still has an unstable Debt to Asset ratio (~82% if there isn't actually any fraud) and poor cashflow.

Let me know what you think, I may be going full retard here. My main lack of knowledge is whether credit raters have a good history of being quick to act and with what degree they usually respond. How seriously do you think they will take the report or do you think it's already been dismissed?",2019-08-19,97,77

## General Electric - The Company

GE was founded in 1892 by Thomas Edison with help from J.P. Morgan. It was an original member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it remained a component from 1907 to 2018, where it was eventually replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Today, the company is in the industrial sector, and is classified as being in the diversified industrials industry. General Electric began as an electric company, but it is now an industrial powerhouse. 

If you look around your home, you may find a GE microwave, refrigerator, or even GE light bulbs, but they also build airplane engines, medical equipment, and various locomotives. They are even in the oil and gas industry. GE is a vast company, and was once a staple of the U.S. economy. However, we can see in the chart above that the stock has been hurting since topping in 2016-2017. Earnings mishaps and company management has hurt the stock in recent years.  

### GE Long-Term Analysis

* An uptrend began in early 2009.
   * Lasted until 2017 where the trend line and 200-weekly moving average were broken.
* GE fell out of a symmetrical triangle to signal the top.
* Bullish divergences in the weekly MACD and RSI indicators.
   * Notice the trend line support bounce after the stock fell out of the triangle pattern. 

### GE Medium-Term Analysis

* After falling through the bottom of the triangle, the stock tried to recover as it bounced off of the long-term trend line support on the 10-year chart. However, the triangle resistance held, and the stock continued lower.  
* The stock then gapped lower to break a $20 support, signaling that this was more than a correction.  

### GE Short-Term Analysis

* After falling through the bottom of the triangle, the stock tried to recover as it bounced off of the long-term trend line support on the 10-year chart. However, the triangle resistance held, and the stock continued lower.  
* The stock then gapped lower to break a $20 support, signaling that this was more than a correction. 
* GE is now in a confirmed downtrend, but today, is looking to try and break it.
* After falling below $6.50, the stock recovered to $11, but has since moved into a diamond formation at the downtrend line resistance.
   * These are generally bearish patterns, and I would expect the stock to continue in its downtrend from here.
      * The weak volume beginning in mid-March is another bearish sign for the stock.
* Testing the 200-day moving average and downtrend line. 

# General Electric Stock Report

General Electric stock has been a staple of the U.S. stock market for many years. Their consistent dividend payouts, and its correlation the U.S. economy made it a part of many portfolios. Plus, it was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and is still part of the S&P 500. But the stock has underperformed the last 20 years. The stock peaked in September of 2000, and hasn’t been that high since. 

Recently, General Electric stock has fallen on some hard times since peaking in July 2016. Since then, the stock has lost more than 65% of its value, and at one point was down as much as 75%. The stock may have bounced back slightly, but I think there is still room for the stock to run lower. The diamond pattern is a bearish formation, and it is coming off of the minor recovery the stock made from $6.50. It is also brushing along the downtrend resistance line and 200-day moving average.  

The stock is rated a SELL, and this may be the best time to sell, whether it is selling a long position, or selling short. There is simply too much going against the stock for me to think it will break the current downtrend. 

However, there is some hope for GE bulls. The long-term weekly indicators are showing bullish divergences, so the pain may be weakening over the coming weeks or months. But that is the problem. The long-term indicators are signaling a bullish divergence, and that will likely take time take to play out. So, what wi;; we look for in a bottom? 

The past two bottoms in General Electric stock came fast. The stock reached its bottom after a final plunge in the stock, then it came back just as fast as it fell. But the stock found bottoms when the rest of the stock market found a bottom. That is to say, the stock market as a whole was falling because of an economic recession. GE was reacting with the broader market. This time it is different. The stock isn’t falling because the economy is weak. The economy is strong, but the company is weak.

GE investors should wait for a clear sign that the stock has found a bottom before jumping in on any rallies. The first sign would come from breaking the downtrend and 200-day moving average. Another signal would be generated if the 50-day moving average were to cross above the 200-day moving average. This would tell us there is momentum in the price rally. But if we’re lucky, the stock will have a clear reversal pattern signal for investors to jump in on.

“We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE, while overestimating the value of small positives, and with a 38% move in the stock year to date, and >50% cuts to forward fundamental FCF (free cash flow) anchors, we are cutting our [price target] and moving to” underweight, wrote Tusa in a note to clients.",2019-04-08,36,32

Judging off of what happened in 2008 with the auto industry, I believe that GE will not DIE, but go into HIBERNATION for quite some time.

I'm not a professional, but I'm not an amateur. I want to invest in GE because I believe that 5 years down the line it will hit above $20.

73z8jt_HON,HON,stockAday: can you wait for GE's CEO to talk? $GE,"We wrote about [GE back in Nov 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/5euvec/a_genius_again_ge/) and concluded:

Okay, it's a quality stock, a great deal maker, constantly adjusting its portfolio. But it's hardly a bargain, in the way BRKB is when you take account of its investments.

So with the stock down down down... is it still a quality stock and is it now a bargain?

# Next, what's changed in a year?

It's clearly not been a great year for GE, even if they've managed to restructure the Oil division merging it with Baker Hughes, and no nasty surprises from the old GE Capital. Sentiment and earnings have slipped.

|$GE|a year ago|today|change|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Price | $29 | $24| -17% | 
|Target price | $33 | $29 | -12% | 
|Sales forecast | $125bn | $125bn | -0% | 
|EPS forecast | $1.72 | $1.56 | -9% | 
|PE ratio | 17x | 15x | -6% | 

Notably missing on the [2Q call](https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE-USQ_Transcript_2017-07-21.pdf) in July was any reference to the old goal of $2 a share in earnings in 2018. Hmmm...

# 1. But back to basics, what is GE?

General Electric Company is a global digital industrial company. The Company's products and services range from aircraft engines, power generation, and oil and gas production equipment to medical imaging, financing and industrial products. 

It's a big as$ conglomerate and have been a round for over 100 years. They are constantly refining their portfolio, merging divisions with competitors, selling off units, buying new companies. It's all about staying ahead of the pack!

# 2. Is it working?

Well, it's a huge machine with eight multibillion dollar revenue lines. When one business is outperforming it seems another isn't. The worst of the GE Capital fiasco is behind then. The worry over the oil unit has passed. Now it down to good old sales and innovation across all units. 

|Metric|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $117bn | $117bn | $124bn | $125bn | $131bn| 
|EPS | $0.94 | $0.17 | $1.00 | $1.56 | $1.68|

But net net, the $2 a share target is no longer achieveable, as far as Wall Street is concerned. 

# 3. Cash coming out of their ears?

As powerhouses go, GE is generating approximately $20bn of cashflow a year, and they like to pay it back to shareholders. For 2017 the aim is $11 to 13bn of share buyback and $8bn of dividends. i.e. this year the dividend alone should be $0.96 which is a nice 4% yield. 

Though it seems that there is still a substantial amount of debt, with $90B on the books. That is 4.9x it's latest operating profit. A little high for my liking.

# 4. Prettier than?

Neither their margin nor their returns look amazing when compared to other large industrial firms. At least in the US. And it's only versus the Europeans that it looks a lot better. And a comparison against other _ragbags_ like Buffett, J&J or IBM doesn't make them look any prettier.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
General Electric Company | $119,572M | 15% | 10%
Industrials |||
Honeywell International Inc. | $39,359M | 22% | 25%
United Technologies Corporation | $58,108M | 18% | 18%
Siemens AG (ADR) | $97,690M | 14% | 16%

International Business Machines Corp. | $78,440M | 21% | 67%
3M Co | $30,533M | 28% | 46%

But it's when we get to valuation that things start to perk up. The earnings multiple isn't aggressive, the dividend is reasonable, and although the long-term growth does look a little high, there is the comfort that management is focused on organic growth & margins. Better still they have done a good job of returning $20bn+ to shareholders the last couple years.

# 5. Wall Street believes

So even though, expectations have been pulled in, Wall Street still says _Buy_ with a target of $28.50 a share which is nearly 20% up from here.


# 6. Any catalysts?

The 2Q call in July wasn't inspiring, as the old CEO, Jeff Immelt prepared to hand over on 1st August to the new CEO, John Flannery. There was talk of restructuring in some divisions, a down market in 2017 for others, challenges, etc. So it's no wonder the stock's taken a beating.

Next comes the 3Q results in late October and then the grand event, the new CEO's strategy day on November 13th. Will he _kitchen sink_ the outlook? He can't throw the old CEO under a bus, as he's still the Chairman until January, but he can give muted outlook.

# 7. Admiration not love

The adage is ""buy the rumour, sell the news"", so I'm tempted to dip in now. It's a solid business and the new CEO may streamline the business further. Maybe not. But even so, it feels like its now a quality business at a reasonable price.

6puosc_QCOM,QCOM,"Thoughts on $TJX, $GE, $QCOM","Just started  a small positions in these three in my overall portfolio after downsizing out of a few that have made a good run in the last few months and taking some profits off the table. And I would appreciate any thoughts you may have. 

Right now these three are all in a bearish environment and I know trying to catch a falling knife is near impossible. But I think now is a good time to start building a position. All three have taken about a 20-30 percent decline over the last 6 months or so. GE 32-25, QCOM 70-55, TJX 80-65. 

THESIS:
GE, not much to say here except I think it's just at a good value, and pays a solid dividend at this price. 

QCOM is being dragged down by legal woes, which I think will get settled sooner than later and their NXP deal will get done eventually....but I believe that mobile connectivity still has room to get better and faster.

TJX to me is just being dragged with all retail because of everyone's fear of amazon, but i don't think it really competes. I go to home goods quite a bit and it's usually much busier compared to other stores I occasionally visit. I also think they benefit with more discount goods for their inventory from how badly other department store are doing.

Anyways, would love to hear thoughts or different perspectives on these 

Full disclosure: I have started a small position within this last week in all three.

I was away for some time, trying to get completely anally-raped by the CFA level 2 exam last saturday. I managed to walk away with only a slight limp. 

Anyway, going over some setups for the future:

**[AAPL](https://in.tradingview.com/x/BVMRCicd/)**

This is the same setup we discussed last time, the only difference is that our time series has changed. Our uptrend leg is a little longer, we'll need to be patient. The reduction in volume here is our key supporting indicator. What's also interesting here is that the RSI(above) and the CCI(below) are flattening out. Given these are relative indicators, there is definitely some divergence going on here. The ending of the Crab pattern usually has some drastic moves as discussed before, so we need to keep our SL a little higher than usual, around 5%. Entry point here is 161-164 for the short, SL around 170. T1 here is 132, T2 125.

**[GE](https://in.tradingview.com/x/dKIgAgo0/)**

This is another from last week. We see a confluence of two patterns, a butterfly and a bat. Below our B point in this formation, we observe a Bat Action Magnet Movement to the D point. Given that there are 2 patterns here, we should see some high conviction movement towards the 25 mark. Given our time series, this could end up hitting 25 in the July Series. Once we hit the 25 mark, we should see a strong uptick back up to the 29 mark or even higher. Let's track this for now. Volume and RSI not contributing here to our conviction but that's alright. 

Traders can enter for a short here, we have only one Target, that is 25.37. SL should be kept at 28.

**[XOM](https://in.tradingview.com/x/8S36u26u/)**

Exxon mobile is also exhibiting some bat movements. Traders can short here for a target of 74.5, SL is 82, the risk reward ratio here is not that great, but its a high conviction move.

Once we get to the D point, traders can enter at 74.36, SL 71.5. T1 is 83.84, T2 is 86. Risky traders can hold for 90. This looks like a juicy trade. 

Again, for our supporting indicators we are seeing a reduction in RSI and a lightening in Volume. The selling conviction might increase and since we are seeing a relatively longer red candle towrads the D point, it might come faster than anticipated.


**General Market**

No index analysis right now, but it goes without saying we are precariously perched. Given the time-series of these set-ups i imagine they might happen either at the very top(again) or during a correction. It's important to note that the levels should still hold however traders should be strict with their stops. 

Signs that a pattern is getting invalidated are various however two main ones revolve around high velocity movement/volatility around the D point, or a gap-up/gap-down. Stay away from trades that exhibit this behavior. In my experience at the end/near D points, key events just seem to happen. 

Happy to answer any questions.

> **Lululemon** — The yoga wear maker's stock is getting slammed after an earnings miss and a weak forecast. Lululemon fell a penny a share short of forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share, and its current-quarter guidance of 25 to 27 cents per share falls well short of the 39 cents consensus estimate. The company said its spring clothing isn't bold enough and promises to make more attractive gear and clothing to correct the problem.

3htw7e_GE,GE,I cant choose between GE and DIS,"Hey guys, I am still pretty new to the stock market world. I currently own Netflix, Starbucks, MRGE..

I have about $2,000 to put into a stock and I can't choose between DIS and GE.

DIS is great and everybody raves about it on here. I like the company and believe they will be around for a very long time. I love  what they are doing in the movie world and also now they are expanding their park with 14 acres of land for their Starwars land. The only thing holding me back is all this ESPN talk. If ESPN truly is 50% of Disney's income and if it keeps going down that seems like it would bring DIS down a lot. 

GE has been around since the late 1800's and they have income coming in from a lot of products. GE also has a much higher dividend yield which is a bonus but not that important to me. The problem I have with GE is that from what I can see from looking at their chart in the past year they have dropped in price and in 5 years they have gone up around 11 points. Whereas Disney has gone up around 90 points. If this trend continues then Disney would be a better investment. 

I want to keep long term at least a few years. Dividends are a bonus but not required.

What do you guys think ",2015-08-21,9,31

>GE Capital focuses primarily on loans and leases that it underwrites to hold on its own balance sheet rather than on generating fees by originating loans and leases, then selling them to third parties.
