On 5/22, I opened two GLD Call positions at the same time:

$310 Call (expires 6/20): average entry price $5.42, currently floating 25% profit, in-price, the goal is to GLD break through $315 after the opportunity to reduce the position or roll.

$328 Call (expires 6/30): average price of $1.87, betting on the market inertia upward, out-of-the-money but leveraged enough, today burst 61%, still watching to see if you can continue to eat meat.

The strategy is simple:

A conservative follow the trend (in-the-money, close to the current GLD price);

A fight to accelerate the market (out-of-the-money, see momentum push a wave of high volatility).

Gold has been a bit manic lately, and once the GLD goes up $312, both positions may take off . I'm not greedy, and I'm ready to reduce my position at any time.

Any brothers and sisters with the same layout? What's your strategy?

1kst0a8_GLD,GLD,GLD Puts and here’s why,"Position GLD put @ 305 July

Gold has had a remarkable run during all this crazyness. Up 25% YTD and 38% in the last year. While long term I would t bet against gold but this increase is insane. Gold has been touted as a inflationary hedge as well as a stabilizing investment when fear is high. The primary consensus on the bull run for gold is the uncertainty of stocks and then uncertainty of bonds. Long term yields have continued to climb for US treasuries and this is why I believe Gold is going to come back down.
Institutional investors want certainty where they can get it. US treasuries is a relatively risk free investment that is now paying a premium. My belief is we are going to see a massive shift from the GLD into longer term US treasuries as yield start to peak. This is not what is the better investment it is about risk management. Portfolio managers have been buying short term treasuries because long term treasuries have been dog shit for yields because everyone expected rates to go down by now. The yield inversion caused massive amounts of money to stay in short term treasuries because it created by comparison risk exposure to long term treasuries. We are seeing that risk play out right now. Long term yields are rising because the downgrade and also short term rates have stayed elevated past their expected time frame. 
Like everything this comes down to timing. I picked July because my hope is the trade crap is at least calmed. We find our inflation ain't so bad. Unemployment has gone up enough for the fed to start signaling rate cuts. 

TLDR: puts on gold cause it's risk is rising and US treasury yields go up. Also I am retard.",2025-05-22,2,52

1k7m1vq_GLD,GLD,ROAD TO A MILLI - May 09 GLD (Gold) PUTS $300 ($30K+ Profit),"Started Options Trading in March with a $10k deposit. Turned that into $145k profit YTD. (GLD trade hasn't settled yet at the time of writing this).

My strategy is to purchase 5-10 DTE options, based on a careful mix of DD, Donie Truths, and gut instinct. I always give my thesis time to play and I ALWAYS take my profits - I never let the thesis fully play out, if I earn $5K+ unrealized profit on a play, I start planning the exit trade. There are plenty of trades that could have been monstrous if I held to maturity, but there were also a few that would have wiped me out if I held.

Also high volatility, means you pay higher premiums. Please be wary of this - some of these 1-2 DTE options I see for break evens that would be 3 or 4 standard deviation events in a normal market irk me out. You can easily fall victim to significant Theta (time value decay) if your positions don’t leave you with enough time to exit.

For example, on a recent trade I bought 200 x GLD $300 PUTS expiring May 9th on April 24th. I felt Gold was in an overbought position, reviewing the 1-month chart, RSM, and again using gut instinct and Donnie vibes that have recently ushered in a new market optimism. The next day, GLD drops to 2%+ to $301 at the open and I sell for a $30k+ profit.

I’ll continue to post my journey on the road to a Milli… that’s my exit strategy, after I get to $1M I’m writing iron condors for premiums and FIRING away.

Good luck to all of the regards out there, and let me know what you think about this strategy!",2025-04-25,51,19

* China might start dropping US treasuries to mitigate US-dependent risk and also destabilize the US (esp. given how the US in 2022 froze Russia's central bank reserves held in Western jurisdictions during the Ukraine invasion)

**Here is my trade journal step by step:**

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
**\[ OPENED at 2024-08-19 \]**

The current IVR is at 84, while the 62 DTE average IVx is only 19.9, making this IVx level exceptionally high for gold over the past year. On the daily chart, the Gold ETF is trading between the 6/8 and 7/8 levels. The options chain shows that calls 62 DTE are about 130% more expensive, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market. 

Examining the standard expected move (STD1), even at 4 DTE, the upside target is 237 (7/8), with the downside at 6/8. The delta curve shows the 16 delta OTM call trending upwards toward the 8/8 level, which aligns with the 250 level. Given this, I would caution against buying single-leg calls at such inflated prices. A pullback could dramatically reduce their value, and time decay will work against you. If you're determined to go bullish, a simple CALL butterfly offers a better risk-reward ratio!

**The**[ **Options Overlay** ](https://tanukitrade.com/)**quickly highlights the optimal expiry dates to target: Sep 20-27. I noticed a 4% volatility skew between these dates.** The standard expected move (STD1) and delta16 suggest an upward probability range capped at 245, meaning there's an 68% chance that GLD stays below this level by Sep 20.

The US is preparing to seize $300 billion in reserves from Russia being held and frozen in western/friendly countries and give it to Ukraine.

Why is this happening now?  Because republicans are holding up Ukraine funding meanwhile the Russians have been making headways while Ukraine is running short on munition and supplies. And so the CIA or whoever controls the government is trying to backdoor funding to Ukraine

Why is this a big deal? Well, this is potentially provide the largest shakeup in global monetary system in 100+ years? See, there is a very strange thing about money, to ensure trust as a global reserve currency, you kinda are limited by a set of rules and laws, even in periods of total war.

Not since WWII has there been a seizure of foreign assets of anything like this scale. If this does go through and I think it will, it will prompt a massive dumping of US assets from unfriendly regimes such as various authoritarian governments in the middle east and China. This will create a massive leg up in gold.

The payoff for a 7 day collar in GLD is really good. What am I missing?

Collar = long 100 shares at $193, short 1 $193.5 call option for $.90 and long 1 atm put option for $1.00.

https://preview.redd.it/ifs9jcg0u0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dc6e0293cb1e867e89a9e0b159747aed123eb7

GLD has been trading more or less sideways for a while. The options market has been implying a 1.09% daily move in GLD, but the ETF has averaged a 0.8% daily move. The ETF has been range bound, moving only 1.7% this month. If you sold a straddle last month, it would have made a ton of money. 

https://preview.redd.it/8rac0196u0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d8d6d1bdf0ea24e8ff2f688993e5885bccade5c

Looking at the implied volatility graph, we can see that there has been a fairly significant premium in GLD options for the better part of the year. 

We don't know if they're all retail traders, but people have been overpaying for GLD options for a long time. 

https://preview.redd.it/e22ib367u0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=710af6c419ec16e6f39ebfe53d38e47382fbdeb9

A quick look at the IV/RV ratio of GLD shows that its options are consistently expensive. IV is rarely less than realized volatility, with just a few exceptions.

# Our analysis could end here, but we can go one step further and compare GLD volatility to options of similar ETFs.

## The first thing we can do is find correlated stocks.

https://preview.redd.it/yccsqz58u0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecbc5c00bbe5d2896e0c8c892205144f29384c0a

 GDX — a gold miner ETF — is quite correlated with GLD. This makes sense, considering that both are gold-related stocks. 

## We want to find correlated companies because if the price action for the stocks is similar, then the implied/realized vol ratios should be similar.

We can now compare the IV/RV ratios for the correlated stocks. It can help us benchmark the “fair value” of volatility for the ticker we are analyzing.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fgaficg9u0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=be4cbe2cddd3b6fafc11c66d0576d0ceda50e6d5)

Interestingly, we can see that the IV/RV ratio for GLD (Green) is quite consistently above the IV/RV ratio for GDX (Blue). Even though GDX’s IV/RV ratio is already above 1, GLD’s IV/RV ratio is chronically higher for some reason, even compared to GDX.

This is starting to look like an overpriced risk premium.

## Forecasting Volatility

We’ve established that GLD options are likely overpriced. As good traders, though, we want to price these options and quantify how large our edge is.

I will do this by taking a blend of 3 things:

* The PA forecast of volatility
* The historical average implied volatility for GLD
* The RV which would bring GLD’s IV/RV ratio in line with GDX’s

PA Forecast: 10.8%

Historical Average Implied Volatility: 17%

IV/RV Ratio Adjustment: 14.5%

The average of all three is 14.1%.

## Given this volatility forecast, here is the price of the at-the-money straddle and the “fair value” given our volatility forecast.

Current price of the ATM May Straddle: $4.17

https://preview.redd.it/19j732sau0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0fc8e3037d5bac6305e3cd54c69865d1620d24e

 The price of the ATM May Straddle at 14% IV: $3.49

https://preview.redd.it/rwosvsgbu0za1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1124ba6523868d2049adb39744220b43dfc87b0

 Since the straddle requires about $8,500 in margin, a \~$65 profit translates to a 0.75% return on margin over just ten days.

With a trade like this, we don't care which way GLD prices move. We just need the ETF to sit there and not wiggle around too much. 

## Position Sizing and Management.

Luckily, because GLD is an ETF, we don’t carry the same “blow-up risk” as single-name trades. However, this is going to be one of many small trades. I'm not looking to Bill Hwang any given options trade. 

I will hold this trade if GLD realizes less volatility than implied. On the other hand, I will cut the trade if GLD starts moving more than its implied daily move for a few days. Of course, if implied volatility drops, we can get out once the edge is gone.

## Conclusion

I want to reiterate that this is just one of many trades that should be a part of a short-vol book. The research is solid, but the edge that it gives us is not enough for “Let’s yolo our life savings.”

So trade it small; find many similar trades to spread your risk!

Good luck, and happy trading.",2023-05-10,30,27

I'm a bit regarded when it comes to gamma squeezes (it was not a part of my Wendy's onboarding training) so I figured I'd reach out to the pros here for some insight.

With the banking system being 'safe & sound', PM interest seems to be on the rise. In the physical space, inventory is drying up & it stands to reason that if capital is flowing into the physical market, it is likely flowing into the ETFs as well.

Sidenote: PSLV/other Sprott trusts own the physical metal, SLV/others own a lot of paper derivatives. Buy the former to own a claim on the metal, use the latter to trade options. The COMEX/other exchanges operate like fractional reserve banks & trade substantially more paper contracts than can be covered by the underlying metal stock (or rocks if you're a JPM nickel trader).",2023-03-26,172,108

v162u2_GLD,GLD,Anyone under 40 has never invested in a Bear Market & It shows - Long $GLD and $XLE,"If you are 40 today, you would been 26 in 2008-2009.  That is on average the age that adults consider buying their first house, new car, get married, and are in their first career job/profession.  So anyone under 40 has never invested in a bear market. 

This isn't saying experience and age makes you a better investor.  It does however mean that many here are out of their element and have never invested in stocks during a bear market.  Tech stocks were in a bear market from 1999-2012.  That's 12 years.  Assuming that your high growth stocks will recover to ATH's soon is a risky investment strategy.

What has worked well during a tightening monetary policy is commodities, crude oil, gold and dividend stocks.  And while history never repeats exactly, I find it interesting that my best performing stocks are also the same type of stocks that outperformed from 2002-2008 and 2010-2012 until the Fed started QE into infinity.  $HAL, $PSX, $CLF, $MOS, $GOLD, and $FCX are a few that have done very well for me.  

I think this market is trading less on inflation being transitory or non-transitory and more on the Fed's response by tightening. The market doesn't care about inflation.  All it cares about is the Fed's response to inflation and whether the Fed will continue to tighten monetary policy and increase Interest rates and by how much.  And anyone under 40 has never invested in a market where the Fed has tightened.  Growth stocks will not regain prior highs until the Fed switches from a tight to loose monetary policy.  All other stock earnings, news, and inflation and economic data is all noise.

Good Luck",2022-05-30,0,26
uxgt1j_GLD,GLD,$SPY + $GOVT + $GLD Blended Portfolio [DD],"*edit: yes this is a conspiracy post to make you vote for bidden. You got me. Bravo.*

**TLDR**

Interesting  ""blended user portfolio"" from this newsletter I receive, shows a  combination of oversold tech/\[forbidden word\] and traditional defensive  positions. Also, LOL for the ""collar""...

Jokes aside, this is interesting insofar as it can have some convexity:

* **Bull case**: Tech is heavy oversold will rebound, treasuries are not expensive and will stay flat
* **Bear case**: Treasuries and Gold (and defensive equities) can offset further falls in riskier assets

Which  points to a very interesting situation: the classic risk parity  portfolio has been destroyed and it's heavily oversold. Even Gold is  heavy down. Any moderately less hawkish fed news might snap Treasuries  and S&P 500 up strong.

>The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it’s Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they’re here to stay.

In fact we opened at almost $184 before pulling back to a higher lower where it is trading now.  This is super bullish. A close with a higher low intact will mean we are going to consolidate and then push BIG.  Could be a couple days or a couple weeks but it is coming.

Remember the above ? \^

Time to go against this now. Fed's latest FOMC was a total disaster, 100% miscommunication. Some in the markets even said it meant the FED was renouncing its brand new AIT framework (Average inflation targeting) which took 3 years of debate to put on. so no, clearly they aren't gonna give up on this after some random meeting and Powell + Williams made that clear last 2 days. time to go long $GLD again. 

FYi AIT is a new framework for which the final aim is to maximize employments so long as inflation permits. 

Normally this is always the dual mandate of the FED but this is a different interpretation of it which allows for a lot more job gains; the societal goal behind it is to minimise joblessness among women and minorities at the poorest levels.

ng99i7_GLD,GLD,$GC (GLD/IAU/GOLD) TA - Breaking a 10 Year Old Pattern - Lot's of Confluence - Weekly Close for Confirmation,"Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now.

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact.

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.**

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March.

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout.

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -***

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

Orange scribbles are used to indicate Inv H&S or H&S peaks. The bottom indicator is called Ultimate RSI which is basically RSI but with Bollinger bands. IDK what the red and green dots are, they seem to give pretty shit signals so just ignore them. The blue line on the ultimate RSI indicator is the actual RSI reading. The rest of the lines are moving averages.

&#x200B;

**AMD:** Looks like a big ass head and shoulders pattern with the lines I have drawn as support resistance. I expect a lot of chop here. If AMD follows through with the head and shoulders, I think $63 is possible. Break through the bottom yellow line (73) would indicate head and shoulders in play. However, it is in an uptrend channel so as long as it follows the channel trendlines, it's still bullish.

&#x200B;

**WDC:** As of [Burry's last 13F filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), he held WDC and it looks like it's been consolidating for a big move. There seems to be bearish RSI divergence (yellow line on the RSI indicator) which is a bearish sign.

&#x200B;

**CAT:** This just broke out today from either a triangle or a bull flag. The earnings call was good but puked it but ever since people have been bidding it back up which is definitely bullish IMO. There does seem to be bearish RSI divergence but volume is a better indicator and the volume here is green after earnings as opposed to sell volume on WDC.

&#x200B;

**TSLA:** Forming a big ass triangle which IMO is bearish. Burry is short TSLA and I'm not about to bet against Burry. Tesla is a cult stock though so it's got a huge following and I wouldn't be surprised if by some miracle it keeps going higher.

&#x200B;

**QQQ:** QQQ has lost most of it's steam along with a lot of the hype stocks. It did bounce off of this trendline yesterday and closed near it today. Break below could get interesting. Momentum seems to be dead in QQQ.

[QQQ 2H chart](https://preview.redd.it/t68amy8foex61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=739d8af6f37c05c7bf351e2451d414b3461d8cbb)

&#x200B;

**IWM:** IWM also looks toppy as strength seems to be fading from tech and non-profitable companies. Looks like some form of a head and shoulders although I can't say for certain where the neckline is. IMO, if IWM breaks and starts to bleed, it will have a lot of major effects in the market. Reason is that a lot of retail is holding stock in the overvalued companies that are in the Russel 2K. Same for QQQ and tech. If retail starts to feel fear and they start selling en masse, it could get ugly. But for now, IWM seems to be in an uptrend for the past month.

&#x200B;

**DIA:** Like the other indices, the Dow is also in a period of consolidation but it appears to have broken above today and retested the previous resistance. IMO, this could be a result of sector rotation into ""safer"" stocks.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Most heavily traded ETF and most popular derivative of the S&P 500, SPY is also in a zone of consolidation. Break below would get ugly, break above would be the Fed continuing to go BRRRR. That being said, there does appear to be some bearish RSI divergence on SPY.

&#x200B;

**GDX:** GDX is gold miners. GDX failed to follow through with the head and shoulders and instead broke out of a bull flag. Gold will follow the miners so this is bullish for gold.

&#x200B;

**GLD:** Last but not least, gold. Gold appears to be in the midst of a cup and handle that's been 7 years in the making. If GDX goes higher and GLD follows, this is gonna be a nasty play. That being said, since the time frame for the pattern to form has taken 7 years and the candles are weekly, it wouldn't be a massive gain in a short period of time. It would be a much longer long. GLD is currently retesting the handle resistance which is now support.

# What is priced in FED Land ? 

Nearly a full hike in EOY 22 | 2.3 % Average fed funds over next 30 years | 10/2 at 143 bps which is a level last seen in Dec 2016 which is the peak of the Trump era.  
I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

the simulation implies 7% Q4/Q4 GDP growth in 2021, a decline in the unemployment rate to 3.7% in 2021Q4 and 3% by 2023Q4, a pickup in core inflation to 2.2% by 2023, and one to two rate hikes in 2023 under our interpretation of the Fed’s new framework. We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

While inflation in the reopening-sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient,a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021 – led by shelter inflation,healthcare services,and a multi-quarter passthrough of dollar weakness into goods.

Core PCE to peak at 2.3 on DEC 22 !!!!*that TIPS-based breakeven inflation, based on CPI inflation measures, could move considerably higher and still be consistent with a PCE inflation outcome modestly above the 2% target.”*

**My own Conclusion** If you assume no infra or an infra bill that is close to entirely paid for via additional taxes and has a low multiplier we are definitely slightly above fair value in terms of rates. The Fed into FOMC next week WILL not assume an infra bill or its implications within the SEP thus in this case it is still possible to have a SEP that shows **no HIKE in 2023** So I cannot help but be bullish duration (& implications, see title) into FOMC March 16 and Auctions March 11 However - **Progress on infra / Data points indicating or suggesting faster path to min u6 will be hawkish EuroDollars (& implications)**

a) we will get a FED that, by ignoring the infra bill, will be able to push back VERY strongly through the SEP   
b) We are hearing stories of Manchin refusing to use fillibuster (which would make the infra bill A LOT Less exciting)

lw3x8m_GLD,GLD,Gold/GLD has reached bottom,"ALCON:   GLD/Gold has reached a new bottom according to my calculations. It is now down about 15% since it's high on August 3rd. It's also down about 11% YTD.

There are other factors going for Gold and PMs as well, not the least of which is ""Basel III"" and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirements that go into effect at the end of June (look it up).

GLD is also the most shorted (by a lot) of all precious metal ETFs. If you want to buy physical gold it will cost about 15%+ more than the paper asset, reasoning is due to market manipulation of the paper asset, whereas the physical asset is forever limited (like alternative currencies); There is only so much Gold on this planet. Every time GLD goes down the spring coil gets tighter.

ladv10_GLD,GLD,"FYI: If you make a sh**ton of money on SLV, GLD, PPLT or other precious metals ETF you pay a sh**ton of taxes because precious metals have a special tax rate","I'm wondering whether many ppl know this because I didn't for a long time but if you make a shitton of money on precious metals, whether they're coins, bars, or ETFs, you pay the highest tax rate on the gains, the ""collectibles"" tax rate. It's how the US government discourages people from hoarding precious metals. 

The tax rate depends on your tax bracket, but it can be twice as high as the regular capital gains tax rate. For example, for a short term (less than 1 year) held precious metal, the tax rate is massive. 

The tax rate on gains also depends on how the precious metals ETF is structured, but there are plenty of articles like [this one](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/how-are-commodity-etfs-taxed) online.

For this reason, I stopped investing in precious metals except for in tax free retirement accounts. It depends on tax bracket but imagine having to pay 40% of your gains to taxes. I don't know everyone's individual situations but it's just not worth it to me.

With all this SLV campaigning going on, I don't see anyone telling people they'll have to pay taxes out the ass if they make gains with SLV

Edit: [This article discusses SLV ETF in particular](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/youll-pay-more-in-capital-gains-for-these-types-of-etfs-2015-06-22)

> The two most-popular precious metal ETFs are the SPDR Gold Trust, GLD, and the iShares Silver Trust. SLV. Both are organized as grantor trusts.

> Unfortunately, the IRS has ruled that precious metal ETFs organized as grantor trusts are taxed the same as collectibles. As such, long-term capital gains from selling these ETF shares are subject to a maximum individual federal income tax rate of 28% instead of the standard 20% maximum rate. (Source: IRS Private Letter Rulings 200732026 and 200732027.) Finally, be aware that the dreaded 3.8% net investment income tax can also apply to gains from selling ETF shares. That can raise the maximum effective federal rate on long-term gains from precious metal ETFs to 31.8% (28% + 3.8%) for higher-income folks.

A lot of wealthy people have big positions in precious metals right now without worrying of high-taxes because they use those positions as a safe haven in case of crash, so they're avoiding big downsides, and so there's not a real focus on of investing for high gains. They're not expecting to make high-tax gains out of the positions. That's why all this noise about Citadel making a heavy investment run with SLV doesn't make sense to me and smells like misinformation.",2021-02-01,123,35

hunfpv_GLD,GLD,Long GLD / Short TLT,"I've been thinking about how the market is euphorically rallying despite increasing odds of a dem sweep. The view could be that higher tax/regulation is worth a steadier hand. But this weekend it dawned on me that a dem sweep in this environment, has a good chance of spawning some sort of UBI. So maybe equities are rallying because more free money can keep the partyyy going.

I imagine it wouldn't be framed explicitly as MMT/UBI. Probably enacted as temporary, but once entitlements start getting doled out, it's basically impossible to roll them back. So my guess is that will be how we finally wake that inflationary bear we've been prodding for.

Rising inflation necessitates higher rates, correct? Particularly on the long end? Is the fed actually capable of holding down long term rates in the face of inflation? 

So go short TLT? I'm not high conviction on timing, we clearly have some counteractive disinflationary forces at the moment. However rates are really low now, yet treasuries aren't completely out of favor yet (obviously). And once a hint of inflation shows, it'll be too late to get short. So soon seems to be the time to initiate (maybe right after election if dems sweep).

And then in conjuction, go long gold (I already am). (And maybe some btc of you wanna gamble.) GLD/TLT been moving in tandem, but if inflation arises, they basically gotta diverge.

I could see this simple play turning out to be the macro trade of the decade for hedge funds. But i'm not that smart, so tell me why im wrong.",2020-07-20,8,22
htbtc2_GLD,GLD,"$DXY, $VIX, $SPX, $GLD, $TLT (Bearish Correlation)","I searched the sub for anything on $DXY and didn’t see much. Why?

$DXY, the dollar spot index, has been hanging out at ~96 lately. Last time it did this was 6/10, which was followed by a 198pt drop in /ES (S&P futures) on 6/11. 

The time before that was 3/6-3/10. 

Want to guess what happened from 3/11 to 3/23? The S&P lost about 875 points, or about 29%. That was the big dip that brought us to our yearly low of 2174 (/ES). 

Contrasting between the 6/10 circumstance and the current circumstance? $TLT is higher. Bearish. Early March values are marginally higher (Fed hadn’t stepped in yet, so this is less useful here). In short, $TLT being higher today, despite lessening Fed intervention (check the NY Fed chart) is bearish. 

Let’s look at $GLD. Steady increase since lows on 3/16 and a smoothed mathematical local min at 3/20. ATH’s right now. Why? What is driving buying of a risk-off instrument during a period of increasing/“recovering” equity values? 

$GLD set a rolling yearly high of $170.86 on 7/8. It closed today at $170.12. To me, this shows a massive lack of trust in the dollar and equity prices, when compared to the last two trading days. We just had two “balance days” with decreasing intraday resistance and support levels. 

So, what next? 

tl;dr: all signs point to a severe market-wide correction, if we assume a correlation between previous SPY values and $DXY, $GLD, $TLT, and the $VIX.

gcdjeo_GLD,GLD,"DD- GLD, Stagflation, and You","Hey nerds, Duncan here. You might remember me from [last week's DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), in which I argued that a company whose entire business model consists of exploiting the poor is worthy of your totally un-earned NEET bux. In today's not financial advice we are going to talk about the currency without a state, the oldest medium of trade, Scrooge McDuck's drug of choice...I'm talking about gold.

Now, there is a reason that commercial advertisements for gold target demographics that we will generously call ""unsophisticated"". Gold is perfect for short term thinkers/investors because doesn't actually grow in the long term the way equities or bonds do. But to understand the powerful short term play I'm talking about, we need to understand the role gold actually plays in the international monetary system.

After WW2, the Allied powers got together and realized that they needed a way to avoid the hyperinflation of 1930's Germany which had led to the war. In order to ensure currency stability the entire world agreed to peg their currencies to USD. And USD would be backed by gold. If one of the currencies was too much in demand, threatening the carefully managed exchange rates, than the IMF would step in and pump or dump the currency until it returned to the right exchange rate.

That system worked great until around 1971, when Nixon lost tons of the government's tendies napalming rice paddies. The US government paid for the war with debt, and by 1971, Nixon was afraid of actually getting margin called. So he, with no notice to anyone, announced that the US dollar was no longer backed by gold. Suddenly it was a free for all. The US economy was hit with both high unemployment and high inflation, other currencies floated all over the place. Basically, it was the chaos we have today.

So Duncan, you might ask, does anyone buy gold today? Well, almost every central bank in the world continues to hold gold, and lots of it. The reason they do so is the same reason almost all historic currencies were based on gold: that because gold can't easily be printed, it can't be easily be manipulated, and it can't easily be degraded or destroyed. In fact, it's perks strongly parallel those of Bitcoin. In the event of a crisis, a country can liquidate its gold reserves for more currency. This is especially helpful when a reserve currency, or the native currency is in trouble. For example, we see Venezuela, whose own currency is totally worthless, USD reserves are useless due to sactions, and therefore it has turned to its gold reserves to pay for imports of food and medicine.

Gold's reputation as a systemic-risk hedge is so great, that in times of market instability or crisis, it actually assumes a negative beta. That is, it moves opposite equities. However because it is an almost fixed quantity asset, it also changes value against other currencies. So, when we have our friend Jerome running his printer like crazy, increasing the [money supply at an unprecedented rate](https://imgur.com/a/dT62Gbh), he should be increasing the price of gold, or rather, making the USD/Gold exchange rate higher. In fact, we see that around late 2018 the trump tax cut began to pump more liquidity into an already hot economy, [starting a USD/Gold price increase](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html). Likewise, as the world economies look more and more risky, and the world's reserve currency's M2 expands faster than Boogie2988 after a breakup; we should see central banks continue to purchase gold as a hedge against continued economic instability.

The Fed has made it clear, that it will do everything possible to avoid deflation. However, after 10 years of historically low interest rates and at times QE, consumers simply have not seen wages or prices increase significantly. So where has that steadily increasing money supply gone? Well, the answer appears to be that some assets are experiencing inflation: Financial instruments, urban housing, medical care, and college tuition--anything that can be funded through cheap debt--have taken the brunt of inflation. Meanwhile the average American consumer can't even find 4 hundred dollar bills to rub together in an emergency. So we can be almost certain that the Fed will keep printing, in the misguided belief that its freshly minted money will eventually trickle down to the American consumer, but in the process the Fed will raise the price of stocks, bonds, houses, colleges, medicine, and most importantly gold.

As we have discussed, gold is good for two things: hedging inflation, and reducing systematic risk. And right now, both of those traits are looking very, very valuable.

Edit: Since every post I get accused of pump and dump, I will disclose my current related positions: UGLD, and about 1-1.5 oz of physical gold. I include an option recommendation for the algos, but honestly, if you don't know how to gain exposure to gold, this post probably won't help you.

Not many people have gold on their radar. It's an ETF that holds physical gold, except there are no audits and they refuse in principle to audit their subcustodians, which is bizarre. It would be easy to buy puts on GLD and hedge with actual gold you have in a safe or bank deposit box. When stimulus fails to cure people of corona and the thousands of deaths kick in and people get scared, they're going to try to cash in on their plan B, part of which is GLD. That's the time all that counter party risk could come into view and GLD could diverge strongly from actual gold.

fo70mc_GLD,GLD,Serious question about how to manage GLD calendar spread that may move ITM,"[https://i.imgur.com/zkKH1Na.png](https://i.imgur.com/zkKH1Na.png)

Serious question about how to handle a GLD 180C Dec2020/Jan2022 calendar spread I have:

* Last summer, I entered a June 2020 / June 2021 GLD 180C calendar spread, net debit \~$110K. In January, the June 2020 leg (sold-to-open for $80K) was down to $10K, so I bought-to-close it for a $70K gain.
* In early February, before the big crash, I entered a Dec 2020 / Jan 2022 GLD 180C calendar spread, net debit \~$120K. The hope was that GLD would hover just under 180 before Dec, and then skyrocket higher over 2021-2022.

My big concern now is that GLD might blow past 180 before December. But I want to hold the June 2021 calls and January 2022 calls as LONG as possible. My goal with the calendar spread was to offset the cost of longer-dated options, not to capitalize on changes in volatility. I'm expecting gold to get to $2000+ by 2022.

So I don't know how to exit my December 2020 GLD 180C short position without taking a big loss. Any ideas on what I can do here?",2020-03-24,7,5

e1mt3t_GLD,GLD,GLD vs GLDM?,"So I’m new to actively managing my own stocks (year or so). I’ve never really taken the time to look into metal stocks or ETFs as Ive always just purchased physical metals. 

Today I started looking around at various ways to invest in metals from a stock angle and I am getting hung up on GLD and GLDM. My question about GLD and GLDM  isn’t so much as if it’s worth investing in either or which is better per se. I was wondering what is the difference? My understanding is that both are state street bank gold shares, that merely attempt to track gold pricing. One is just “mini” hence the ‘M’ correct? The charts appear to line up identically, with GLDM appearing to be 1/10 cost of GLD. If I’m correct so far, this is where my confusion arises. If they operate the same (in my mind like BRKA and BRKB) why do they have different net expense ratios on yahoo finance? GLD is listed as 0.4% and GLDM is 0.18%.

If someone wanted to invest $1,000,000 in either one, why would anyone choose GLD over GLDM?

What am I missing?",2019-11-25,15,4

59kgsd_GLD,GLD,stockAday: ETF fun with the golden one? i.e. $GLD,"# Key Stats for SPDR Gold Trust (ETF)

Let's have some ETF fun and look at the Gold one!

|Ticker|[GLD](https://stockflare.com/stocks/gld)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Exchange Traded Funds
Latest price | $120.92
Value | $39 billion
Daily vol | $1.1 billion
Date | 26 October 2016

### Useful Links
* Latest analysis from [ETF.com](http://www.etf.com/GLD) and [ Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gld/quote.html)
* Website: [spdrgoldshares.com](http://www.spdrgoldshares.com/)

# Description

* SPDR Gold Trust holds gold and from time to time issues SPDR® Gold Shares, or Shares, in Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with redemptions of Baskets.
* The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the gold market through an investment in securities. 
* Historically, the logistics of buying, storing and insuring gold have constituted a barrier to entry for some institutional and retail investors. The ownership of the Shares is intended to overcome these barriers to entry. The logistics of storing and insuring gold are dealt with by the Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. 
* Therefore, the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security.

# Strategy 

Well, the strategy is quite obvious, isn't it? Buying gold. 

As they say on their website:

> As an asset class, gold is unique. The economic forces that determine the price of gold are different from the economic forces that determine the price of many other asset classes such as equities, bonds or real estate. Gold offers investors an attractive opportunity to diversify their portfolios.

Hard to disagree with it being a unique way to diversify. Though the question I always ask myself is: why bother? 

# Efficiency / Fees

Now the GLD isn't the only Gold ETF but at $39 billion it's the granddaddy. So rather than benchmark it against iShare's $9bn $IAU fund (0.25% fee v GLD's 0.40% per annum). Let's look at non-obvious peers:

* Vanguard's Basic Materials ETF, given they include a lot of miners who are digging gold out of the ground, among other things
* PowerShare's Commodity Index ETF, since you could look at a broader commodity play as a away to diversity
* Vanguard's TIPs inflation protected ETF, since Gold is looked at as an inflation hedge

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|SPDR Gold Trust $GLD | 0.40% | -0.37% | No | n/a |
|Vanguard Materials $VAW | 0.10% | -0.06% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|PowerShares DB Commodity ETF $DBC | 0.67% | -1.30% | No | n/a |
|Vanguard Inflation Protected $VTIP | 0.08% | -0.08% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

Clearly it's not cheap at 40bps a year, though given there is a physcial product to store...I suppose it's not terribly epensive. 

# Asset Allocation

The asset allocation won't shock you, it's in gold. So let's have a little fun and try and understand the drivers of gold.

|	Tonnes	|	2010	|	2011	|	2012	|	2013	|	2014	|
|	:---	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|
|	SUPPLY	|		|		|		|		|		|
|	Mine Production	|	2,754	|	2,834	|	2,924	|	3,061	|	3,133	|
|	Recycling	|	1,536	|	1,676	|	1,644	|	1,246	|	1,172	|
|	Net Hedging Supply	|	0	|	32	|	0	|	0	|	95	|
|	Total Supply	|	4,290	|	4,542	|	4,568	|	4,307	|	4,400	|
|	DEMAND	|		|		|		|		|		|
|	Jewellery Fabrication	|	2,108	|	2,183	|	2,197	|	2,732	|	2,483	|
|	Industrial Fabrication	|	408	|	381	|	360	|	348	|	347	|
|	Net Physical Investment	|	1,118	|	1,379	|	1,284	|	1,700	|	1,010	|
|	Net Hedging Demand	|	118	|	0	|	47	|	30	|	0	|
|	Net Official Sector Purchases	|	104	|	516	|	582	|	648	|	588	|
|	Total Demand	|	3,856	|	4,460	|	4,471	|	5,458	|	4,428	|

The supply side of the equation looks pretty stable, where the volatility comes is on the demand side with *investment* and *central banks* causing the big swings.

The second thing that stands out is the huge size of the Jewellery and Industrial businesses. If anyone pooh-pooh's gold to you as a useless commodity with no intrinsic value, then stop them. Please. it's got a lotta demand as a product.

# Valuation

There really isn't any way to judge the valuation that I can think of. Okay, I can get a yield on the Materials ETF, a negative yield on the TIPS and nothing on GLD or DBC, but it's really not about yield is it?

# Well?

So looking at ETFs, I like to come to think of 3 questions (1) Am I happy with the asset itself? (2) happy with this specific strategy? (3) Happy with the provider of the ETF?

1. Well, this is a gold ETF, so, I'm happy enough with the asset class and underlying as an uncorrelated asset. Though I really can't see myself having more than a low single digit allocation to it.

2. Now when it comes to strategy, I wonder, maybe I should just buy a basket of gold miners. Aren't they a leveraged play, and they have end customers?

3. And finally, what about GLD itself... well frankly, as a cheapskate, why would I pay 0.40% per annum v 0.25% at iShares.

4y3jn1_GLD,GLD,Any opinions on GLD or IAU,"I'm interested in a good stock play right now or the next week or so.  Thinking about the gold ETFs (GLD or IAU).

Backgroud: The last time I invested was in 2008... so I'm nervous to get back in.  But I'm looking to make a short term move, but I'd be interested in a long term play too if it presented itself.  Right now I'm worried about a bearish turn on the market overall.  I'm familiar with advanced options strategies, but have never actually done anything except an uncovered call.

Question: I'm looking into gold ETFs.  My beginner level research on gold, as expressed via the GLD stock, seems to indicate resistance/support around $127.50 and $138 respectively.  Right now it is $128.47.  As a person who's lost way too much money than I'd like to reveal, does this sound like a decent short term play?  I'm interested in stock or options.

TL;DR: I lost a lot of money in the past on options.  Is GLD/IAU (Gold ETFs) a decent play right now?  (And are my support/resistance even close to correct?)",2016-08-17,1,5

Avoiding The GLD
By Turd Ferguson | Thursday, June 4, 2015 at 11:21 am

As the reported ""inventory"" of the GLD moves into negative totals for 2015, I thought it would be fun to bring some of these numbers into perspective once again.

Back on Tuesday, the GLD reported another outflow of ""inventory"". The drop was nearly 5 metric tonnes and it brought the total stated ""inventory"" down to 709.89 metric tonnes. As ""inventory"" began the year at 710.81 mts and price began the year at $1184, you can see that both price and ""inventory"" are now down slightly for all of 2015. But that doesn't quite tell the whole story.

Back on January 1, 2013, the price of paper gold was $1650/ounce. That day, the total ""inventory"" of the GLD stood at 1,349.92 metric tonnes. Again, as of yesterday, price was $1185 and GLD ""inventory"" stood at 709.89 mts. What's the big deal, right? Price is down and ""inventory"" is down, too. But let's put this into perspective as simple numbers often need context to be appreciated.

Since 1/1/13, the GLD inventory is now down 640.03 metric tonnes....

​OR

20,578,000 troy ounces

OR

Slightly more than the combined holdings of Austria, Belgium and Mexico.

Stated another way, since there are about 400 troy ounces in every London Good Delivery Bar, over the past 27 months the GLD has shed about 52,000 of these:

And if you pile 192 of them onto a pallet, suitable for forklift movement back and forth across an LBMA vault, you'd fill about 271 pallets. That's a lot.

Of course, we're supposed to believe that this is all genuine, allocated and real gold...keeping in mind that the custodian for all of this ""gold"" is HSBC. (Yes, the same HSBC that has been charged with all sorts of crimes from tax evasion to market manipulation to money laundering. No doubt, though, that their custodianship of the GLD is on the up-and-up. <sarc>) I'm sure that none of this ""gold"" has been used to satisfy eastern physical demand. It has all simply been shifted out if the GLD and into other vaults, where it sits now, collecting dust...just a useless relic and antique.

But I digress, please allow me to give you some additional perspective...

After the ruthless and merciless, Cartel-sponsored beatdown of April 12-15 2013, a beatdown designed to smash the 19-month floor that had held near $1525, price fell further through June of 2013 before finally bottoming at...wait for it...$1180 on June 28, 2013. So, it has now been nearly two years and price is basically unchanged as of this morning.

But what has happened to the GLD over this same time period? Is its ""inventory"" unchanged, too? Hardly.

On the evening of June 28, 2013, the GLD reported ""inventory"" of 969.50 metric tonnes. Again, as of this last Tuesday and with price nearly unchanged in the 2 years since, total reported ""inventory"" is just 709.89 mts. That's a drop of 259.61 mts or nearly 27%. Using the same visuals as above, that's 8,347,000 troy ounces of about 21,000 London Bars filling 109 pallets. WOW! All while price is unchanged.

So, what's the point of all this?

To me, it's clear that the GLD is being drained of whatever physical gold it holds. This gold is being used to satisfy insatiable Asian/Eastern physical demand. If you own shares of the GLD and you think you actually own ""gold"", you don't. What you own is a simple paper proxy for the gold price. Suitable for day-trading and that's about it.

If you want to really own gold, your only option is to do what the Chinese, Russian, Indians et al are doing...BUY IT AND TAKE DELIVERY. You don't own it unless you hold it. In the end, when the music stops playing and the paper charade fails, those owning shares of GLD will find themselves wanting just the same as any other holder of an unallocated or pooled account.

2s2n44_GLD,GLD,GLD and SLV ETF holdings,"Its said that a key indicator of the investment demand for precious metals is the holdings of ETFs and of COMEX. 

Reports state that the total of gold holdings fell 30% from >100000 thousand oz in 2013 to around 65000 thousand in 2014.

While silver holdings hovered around 860 million oz.  

Why has silver ETF holdings held instead of dropping like gold?

Both have lost significant price value. 

Does anyone know what results in the increase or decrease in ETF total holdings?  Anyone know why there's such a difference in change in the physical holdings of gold vs silver?  Whats going on and why?

27up3f_GLD,GLD,GLD,"Looking for another cute short before I get long Gold for the rest of the summer. This is kinda a risky trade so I'll be watching closely if it gets put on, and it won't be a large position. 

I'm looking to put a put position back on somewhere if gold gets up around/near $122.60 (the 21 day simple moving average) to $122.71 (a resistance line I drew). (see levels in the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/itqLXkx.png) ). 

The recent rally has been short covering with no real reason as to why GLD is up. Yields are up (Bad for gold), dollar is up (bad for gold), inflation (well if you ex out food and gas isn't really happening, ie bad for gold). 

Going forward there is a reason to be long GLD from around July 1st + or - a few days onwards, so this is a quick cute trade if the levels allow it. Mind you the SMA is going to move, might be up or down depending on the action (so that $122.60 isn't a static number). 

So this is a time dependent trade it has to happen before July 1st. I'd love to see it go to $115 however I'm guessing it's likely going to hit $119.50 ish prior to the next leg up. (assuming all goes well and I'm right).
