**Not saying what I’m doing, but general thought process:**

Selling CSPs a bit below current price = paid to maybe own GME cheaper

Covered calls if you’ve been holding = collect rent while it chops

Maybe even spreads if you wanna cap risk and still nibble on IV

Price action from the last week has IV jacked... Let the IV cool off and premiums melt.



**Food for thought:**

Is GME’s Bitcoin buy actually bullish long-term?

Anyone else think this might end in an IV crush once the hype fades?",2025-05-28,471,116

$SLE just hit an all-time low, and there are fresh rumors about a potential buyout. With a market cap now around 3 million, GME could literally scoop it up for pocket change.

I’m thinking about opening a small position but wanted to hear what y’all think. Strategically, it makes sense. custom in-game ads are a growing market, especially in platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, and (soon) GTA 6. Roblox even launched video ads with Google recently, proving this space can be highly profitable.

Would GME make a smart play here or just let it burn? Curious to hear your thoughts.

1jjxd6y_NET,NET,GameStop shares surge after firm pledges to add bitcoin to balance sheet,"GameStop said Tuesday that its board has unanimously approved the addition of bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

GameStop shares jumped 7% to $27.23 in after-hours trading.

The decision echoes that of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, which in February dropped the word “Micro” from its name and unveiled a new logo, to emphasize its commitment to the cryptocurrency space.

Strategy said that the rebranding was “a natural evolution” as it seeks to integrate bitcoin — the world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency — into the heart of its business operations.

The move by GameStop comes shortly after President Trump’s executive order, signed earlier this month, to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies using tokens already owned by the government.

GameStop said it will use a portion of its cash or future debt or equity issuances to be invested in bitcoin, but did not specify the maximum amount of bitcoin it might buy, according to its quarterly filing.

It also posted a rise in fourth-quarter profit, helped by its efforts to reduce costs, as it continues to grapple with a slow turnaround in its mainstay of retailing videogame hardware and merchandise.

GameStop’s fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $131.3 million, compared to the same period last year, when it posted $63.1 million.

The company, once at the center of the “meme stock” trading frenzy, has been struggling with its primary business due to an exodus towards digital downloads, game streaming and e-commerce shopping.

However, it has been aggressively cutting costs. It closed 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024 and anticipates closing a “significant number” of additional stores in fiscal 2025.

It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.28 billion, compared to $1.79 billion a year earlier.

1hlfr0k_GME,GME,Gamestop (GME) is a multi-faceted deepest-value buy stock as of now. Allow me to convince you. I have a lot of data in my side (PART 1) from the GoPro guy.,"I'm not sure many will know me, as it's been a long time since I've posted (Go-pro guy as people call me and I have also written about Vestis which is up 44%, look into my past posts). Im understanding this post will net me some dislikes, however, Im willing to risk it as I stand strong with my data (so give me the dislikes if you will). Allow me to convince you with several data types spanning from heavy institutional buying, fundamentals regarding GameStop's financial statement, along with high FTD (which causes mandatory buy-ins causing upward movement and volatility). A lot of people seem to believe that Gamestop is fueled with sheer hype, but I dont believe so as I believe in the data, the facts. There are also heavy institutional buying from the highest performer which suggests otherwise.

This is PART 1.  Part 1 will be touching deep value indicated by institutional buying and FTD data which I will explain for those who've never heard about it.  
  
Tomorrow, I will be uploading PART 2 which touches upon fundamentals especially regarding its cash pile (money earnt from interest from treasuries), possibility of turn-around, CEO analysis.

If there are points you want to discuss, feel free. I am willing to explain, or possibly refute any counter arguments, or agree with your points, whatever it is, please do comment if you have questions. This post is very simplified, as I believe everyone should understand. Unfortunately, this sub does not allow embedding images (Would like to request the mods for this as it's paramount to evidence). Anyways:

# Heaviest INSTITUTIONAL BUYING I've witnessed in a long-time:

Theres a 50:5 ratio of Q3 buy ins or as of (2024/09/30). Explained further below

1. [https://www.businessinsider.com/renaissance-technologies-rentech-simons-nvidia-tesla-gamestop-stock-portfolio-quant-2024-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/renaissance-technologies-rentech-simons-nvidia-tesla-gamestop-stock-portfolio-quant-2024-11)  
\- Jim Simmons. Yes, the quant genius professor turned investor who solved the market using math. Renaissance technologies is the best (quite litearlly the 1st in the world) hedgefund performer when looking at annual performance with a whopping 66% per year using algo's trained with custom-made equations. Although, he had passed away, his equations still exist within his the hedge fund's ai. The ai had cut nvidia and tesla, and built its position in gme. What we do know is that rentech (or its ai really) doesnt buy in with sheer fundamentals but with quant data. Simply stated, the quant data indicates volatility and upward movement. Thus, this buy-in must have happened almost purely because of quant data, which excludes fundamental data (which is bullish too).

2. [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gme](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gme)

\- List by new, and and up the items per page from 25 - 100. What you will see a huge flow of institutional buy-ins from Q3 report. Check it for yourself, there is 50:5 ratio of buy in's where the 5(are puts options). If you notice, even the hedge. Even the hedge funds that have previously shorted have bought massive stocks. Why? It's to hedge the expected upward movement. As of now, only the retailers haven't come in, and January 17th is an expected big day, a day of which I expect retailers to join. In simplicity, 1) institutions bought in 2) waiting for retailers too to up volume 3) volume causes volatility

# Lots of Call options in Jan 17, a massive ratio from calls to puts.

Might seem complicated at first, but I will explain as simply as possible. Calls are basically the right to buy a stock for a certain price in the future (for a premium). The other party, we call them market makers, get benefits by receiving premium, for those permissions. So, I can buy a 25$ strike price call option (each option is 100 stocks), for a 2 dollar premium. Lets say I bought 1 call option contract, then I paid 2 x 100 = 200 dollars in premium for a permission to buy the stock at $25 regardless of the price at that time in the future. So, if its 27 dollars and I exercise, then I get 0$ (not negative nor positive). Simple. 

In january 17th: [https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/optionchain/?date=20250117](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/optionchain/?date=20250117)

There are approx 120,000 call options in the money, meaning it can be exercised which causes forced buy-ins. 120,000 is a massive number. I would love to add a photo with call:put ratio, but you can check it out yourself. Its quite crazy.   
  
Now lets introduce what FTDs are or Failure-to-deliver.   


# Massive FTDs in pressure due to XRT being in the NYSE RegSho List:

  
Okay, before you say what is that. Hang on there with me. Basically by definition: ""**FTDs (Failures to Deliver)** occur when one party in a trade (typically a broker or market maker that has a short position) **fails to deliver the shares or securities** they owe to the buyer by the settlement date.""

Now, what happens if there are FTDs? They have a new settlement date to deliver those stocks, cuz if you dont thats illegal. Gamestop currently has an insane amount of FTDs, where we havent seen forced buy-ins due to FTDs.

Now what is XRT and NYSE RegSho list.

XRT is an etf, that includes gamestop and several other stops. Hedgefunds use very sketchy methods of shorting gamestop indirectly, through an etf that includes gamestop and other stocks. So, if you want to look for research sakes, you will notice that all the stocks in the XRT etf, will have similar price movements. 

Now, XRT is in the RegSho list or the threshold securities where a significant number of shares have been sold short but haven't been delivered to the buyer within the required settlement period. Basically, it's illegal activity, and now there are forced to deliver those stocks (basically buy stocks for the other party). This happened in 2024/12/23) two days ago, so we know its recent data. The SEC will look into such activity and will force them to deliver those stocks. 

Just from these 3 points alone, there is enough evidence that the stock will go up. However, I will do a part 2 near the same time as today (hopefully, might be later) which will touch upon the pure fundamentals of income statement, balance sheet, cash-flow statement, and the turnaround thesis. 

Thanks for reading, and see you next time. Ask questions if you have!

1hbe28l_GME,GME,GameStop posts surprise profit while sales continue to decline ,"I don’t know if we’re allowed to talk about this stock on this sub or not, but I’ve found following it very interesting. I have no positions whatsoever. I have followed the stock for the past several years as a curiosity. Over the past year I have noticed the interesting trend of rising income and declining sales. Today it was released that the company posted a surprise profit of around $17mm, however their sales declined some 20%. So essentially the company continues to strip down as many costs as possible, which consequently causes their sales to decline. But they seemingly have enough cash and revenue trickle to eke out a profit. To me this is the essence of a zombie company. There’s no aim to make a comeback or grow revenue. They are slowly cutting off parts to show profit. What’s the end game? I can only imagine to squeeze as much liquidity out of stock sales as they wind down the company over an hour extended period of time. ",2024-12-10,804,481

Anyway I'm looking for options on hedging calls and puts. I've bought a few dozen seperate call contracts but never a out contract. 

With the price fluctuating over time I am wondering what strategies would be for both calls and puts. Ie. What kind of strike ranges and dates.

1h7g0hg_GME,GME,GME Covered Calls - Buy Back or Hold?,"I bought some GME shares with the purpose of selling covered calls for fairly juicy premiums. As you can see in the image, they can be bought back for a gain of $117 though the underlying equity loss is $175 at this exact moment.

What I'm thinking about doing is taking the cash, and then doing it all over again but I won't be able to get the same premium at the original strike. I can't figure out what is the best move. I am thinking my best outcome is getting assigned (or expire just below strike, of course) but a 1.5% return on literally 2 days seems.. good?

The dollar value isn't huge, this is really just an opportunity to learn how to best manage selling of covered calls and better understand the mechanics of the process. What would you do in this situation?

1gt4jrg_LMT,LMT,What do you think of this GME call spread I plan to enter next week?,"GME is getting some renewed interest lately. IV is high but not as high as it could be, with earnings coming up but not quite close to release.

It seems like there is a bullish expectation with high call premiums (put premiums not as high). But GME can be wild as a meme stock. Anything can happen, so naked calls or puts are out of the question for me even if deep OTM.

*So I'm looking at this setup with the P&L profile linked below:*

BUY +50 VERTICAL GME 100 (Weeklys) 6 DEC 24 28⁄32 CALL @.32 LMT \[TO OPEN/TO OPEN\]

This is a debit spread, so I'll try to enter sooner than later when IV goes higher close to earnings (though I'm not sure if that would matter).

With a breakeven of just a couple dollars higher and a bullish expectation, it seems like a safe way to bet on the upside without spending a lot up front.

Yes, I would be giving up potential upside, but it reduces my entry cost and need to time the directionality. I could potentially let it expire and keep profits also.",2024-11-17,3,3

1fqsul2_GME,GME,"A definitive, verifiable GameStop update","There was a comment on this sub after the most recent GameStop earnings asking:

*“With all the attention on GME, I would really appreciate hearing a factual argument about how this is a positive for shareholders and a positive for the future of the company. There seems to be a stark divide between what some people want to happen and what appears to be happening.”*

Here are some Q&A-style answers to that comment and others I’ve seen.

**Why don’t GameStop investors care that revenue is decreasing?**

This is probably the biggest misconception about the company’s outlook – the role of the legacy business.

The pre-2021 main bull case for GameStop stock was not that the company would *definitely* turn itself around, but rather that Wall Street was too eager in pegging it for bankruptcy, resulting in its low stock price. The company *was* struggling, but investors like Keith Gill believed that bankruptcy was further on the horizon, that the secular headwinds were overstated for the near-term, that the company had more time than believed to address those concerns.

Fast-forward to 2024. Bankruptcy has been all but removed from the conversation, though more so due to stock offerings as opposed to the resilience of console gaming. Even so, this still upholds the original bull thesis because now it seems they have all the time in the world to right the ship, right?

Not necessarily. The legacy business is still a liability. I say ""legacy"" because many GME investors (including Gill, per his latest stream) aren't sure physical gaming is the future for this company, but it is the current reality. The company is fine, but the business model is flawed and staring at those same secular headwinds. Therefore, the company’s revenue decrease has been attributed more to efforts to right-size those operations in order to return to profitability, thus minimizing the current business model as a liability. It comes at the expense of revenue, but that’s not as big of a concern as it would have been without the cash hoard income they’ve acquired.

**What** ***are*** **investors looking for in the earnings reports?**

More hints at what the cash reserve will be used for. No real plan laid out at this moment.

**Why doesn’t that bother you?**

From a neutral perspective, it seems reasonable to assume one of two possibilities:

* There isn’t a definitive plan for the cash at this moment.
* If there is a plan, it would likely deploy in one aggressive swoop (based on how Cohen tends to invest), so signaling beforehand may seem imprudent to the board.

PERSONALLY (re: now we’re entering into my speculative bull case), I think the timing of the cash deployment will coincide with one thing – the steadying of revenue.

It seems clear that the board is not interested in expanding into new revenue streams unless they're really sure there's no risk to profit margin, however meager. In my opinion, the moment they see that revenues AND profit are holding steady – in other words, that the legacy business is swimming on its own in its little kiddy pool – we will see cash being deployed.

That’s probably my biggest bull case for the stock in the near-term. I don’t buy that the long-term plan is T-bills for that cash hoard. Whether or not you believe Cohen is a savvy investor, one pattern is very clear – when he bets on something, it’s usually a swing for the fences. I think the market will react intensely to the news that GameStop has started deploying its cash reserves, regardless of what the cash ends up being used for.

 

I caution everyone on this sub and others to avoid dismissing the case for GameStop simply because of its intense online following. I really wish it could be talked about in more neutral terms. The reality of most discussion around it being so hyperbolic (whether negative or positive hyperbole) has made it really hard to seek out good sounding boards for discussion.",2024-09-27,2,183

1fdvo8l_NET,NET,"GameStop reports fall in revenue, files for 20 million share offering","(Reuters) -GameStop said on Tuesday it had filed for an offering of up to 20 million shares, sending its stock down more than 10% in extended trading after the videogame retailer's second-quarter revenue fell as consumers continued to switch to online buying.

The company, which has been at the center of a ""meme stock"" trading frenzy, is struggling with declining sales in its primary business of selling new and used video game discs due to a shift to digital downloads, game streaming, and e-commerce shopping.

GameStop said it intends to use the proceeds from the offering ""for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with our investment policy.""

The company is also identifying stores for closure and expects to shut down more outlets than it did in the past few years, it said on Tuesday, in-line with comments made by CEO Ryan Cohen in June.

Cohen warned of intense competition in the gaming console market earlier this year.

Analysts at Wedbush said on Friday GameStop continues to face a near insurmountable barrier to its planned return to growth as streaming services proliferate, while the company shows a total lack of any strategy to enter new categories with growth potential.

Shares of GameStop have seen significant volatility this year after online stock influencer Roaring Kitty returned to X.com following a three-year hiatus, with a cryptic meme that was widely seen as a bullish signal for GameStop.

Roaring Kitty was a key player in the 2021 rally in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that was fueled by individual investors on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.

GameStop reported revenue of $798.3 million for the quarter ended Aug. 3 compared with $1.16 billion a year earlier. Two analysts polled by LSEG were expecting revenue of $895.7 million.

Its net income stood at $14.8 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. This was helped by a 16% fall in the company's selling and administrative expenses in the quarter.

This came after the videogame retailer reported a drop in second-quarter revenue as more consumers shift to online purchases.

Once a major player in physical game sales, GameStop continues to face challenges as gamers increasingly opt for digital downloads, game streaming, and e-commerce. The company plans to use the funds from the share offering ""for general corporate purposes,"" which could include acquisitions and investments in line with its investment policy.

Additionally, GameStop announced plans to close more stores than in recent years, following previous remarks from CEO Ryan Cohen in June about ongoing challenges. Earlier this year, Cohen highlighted the fierce competition in the gaming console market.Analysts at Wedbush commented last Friday that GameStop faces major obstacles to growth, particularly with the rise of streaming services and the lack of a clear strategy to diversify into new categories.

I'm working on my university dissertation about the GameStop saga and hit a snag that you might help me solve. It is a ***short 7000 word research project to complete my Master's degree***.

**The Plan:** My goal was to dig into how options volumes impact GME stock prices during the famous gamma squeezes. I wanted to explore the complex interplay between options trading and stock price movements.

**The Snag:** Turns out, accessing historical options data is not an easy task. Without this data, I'm considering a shift in my research focus.

**Potential New Directions:**

1. **The Power of Social Media:** How does our chatter on platforms like Reddit influence GME’s trading volumes and stock movements? This would involve analyzing how posts and sentiments here correlate with market actions.
2. **Using Proxies:** Looking at things like the put/call ratio and implied volatility to guess at options activity (as proxies to options volume). It’s not as direct, but it might still shed light on what’s happening behind the scenes. However, I don't really know if they are accurate proxies.

**I’d Love Your Input:** Which approach do you think would be more effective or interesting? Any thoughts or tips on navigating these options would be incredibly valuable.

$GME CC, 3 contracts, premium .41 a share, strike at 29 expiring 7/26. I have an additional 24 contracts from last week expiring this week as well that I rolled for about 2k. 

$DJT CC, 1 contract, premium 1.60 a share, strike 36, expiring 7/26.

 I stupidly sold cash puts on this immediately after the assassination attempt. The fundamentals are terrible, I’m just in it for the pump and dump. Just after the assassination attempt there was a pop on the 24 hour market, another pop in premarket, and at market open. I expected the same with Biden dropping out and while there was a surge on the 24 hour market, it failed to maintain those levels premarket and at the opening bell. I’ll be selling these just as soon as I can. 

$AVGO cash puts is kinda hurting me. 1 contract from last week with a strike of 158.5. I don’t think it will come back down to that level by end of week and I’ve tied up 16k that I could use to just buy the stock. It has an avg price projected price in one year at 192 on Fintel, with the price at 160 right now it's basically got a bigger upside potential than $NVDA. $NVDA is sitting at 123 with a projected 1 year avg of 132. Thinking between a 5:1 or 3:2 investment ratio $AVGO to $NVDA.

Finally $PFE.  I bought 30 calls, .55 a share premium, at a strike of 31 expiring 8/30. $PFE just spent 2.54 million on lobbying (info from quiverquant.com). They have earnings coming up on 7/30 premarket and there’s been breakthrough in glp-1 medication in pill form. Covid vaccinations will be on-going revenue and they’ve had positive earning several quarters in a row.

1dgb6oy_GME,GME,Long term bull call spread on GME,"Hi all!

I'm new to options trading, so trying to soak up as much information as possible. Diving into the many strategies that people are using here, I found the bull call spread which seems interesting. While researching I found something and I'm not sure yet what to think of it.

As an example the [option chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/?date=1750377600&straddle=false) of GME for June 2025. I know there's been a lot of talks about GME options here, but I couldn't find anything on this specific case.

Let's say I buy a Bull Call Spread for a 30-50 strike price (buying a 30 call at 12.87 and selling a 50 one at 11.55). Cash required would be 1.32 per contract (132 USD). Then I'd have a year to wait on GME to get above the breakeven price of 31.32 and if the stock price increases near 50 (which it has touched a few times in the last weeks), that'd mean a max profit of 18.68 on intrinsic value alone.

As they're options, I can exercise them whenever something happens with the price.

I know these risks:

* Stock might go down and never reach 31.32
* Capital is tied up for a longer time if the stock price doesn't increase enough
* There might not be enough liquidity to sell the spread when it becomes profitable, given that it's so far in the future
* Bid-spread is wide so when buying it might cost more than 1.32

I'm curious what you think of a trade like this. The risk is there, but it feels like a risk I can take for the potential upside that it brings. Am I missing something?

EDIT: maybe the GME example wasn’t the best choice. I have been holding shares in GME for a few years so I know it’s all over the place. And I hold several other stocks as well. 

I’m checking out different stocks and strategies to ease into option trading. I’m not in it for the quick buck, I posted this to try to understand the dynamics and learn. 

If we were to change the ticker to for example TSLA, for arguments sake. Although the volatility is significantly lower and therefore returns are lower, it felt like a solid bet as you have more time for the calls to come ITM and capitalize on them.

if the data shows price opening between yesterday's high and low, you may not want to swing a long position near the high of day because price may open lower the next day where you may be able to get a better entry at the open of the following day.

I bought some GME calls. GME C 21JUN24 20.00

I'm trying to sell my calls. 

I'm just wondering what I set the limit price that or how I determine that on an option. 

The stock value I can see. 

But I'm selling the contract not the stock. 

When I bought it the premium was around but I had $5 

Currently it's around 15. 

I was an idiot and slept through market open. 

What was premium then?? 

Setting my limit order at that a good idea or are there other variable to consider? Definitely other variables to consider. 

I was considering setting a limit order at 20 and walking away, am I throwing away my money? Any explanation is helpful. 

I'll never sell at market. Just trying to determine how to figure out pricing when selling options

1bpcl1h_GME,GME,"Besides the GME issue, are there other reasons to not use Robinhood?","I saw an article about Robinhood's new credit card and the comment section was absolutely ripping them apart. I started looking through a few reddit posts about Robinhood and why people don't like it and it seems like almost all hate on it is derived from the GME issue. I opened up a Robinhood account years ago because other brokerages were charging fairly high commissions for trades. I was only investing small amounts so something like $5 per trade was pretty heavy at the time. I just recently got back into investing again and I am doing buy and hold mostly. I don't plan on doing day trading, trading options or anything like that just long term investing.  


Is there any other reason I should use a different broker like Fidelity for example? I see they also don't have fees but I don't want to switch because of one thing that upset a lot of people. If there are other reasons what other firms would you recommend for long term investing?

1bnm1sf_MAR,MAR,GameStop squeezing ahead of earnings,"GameStop (GME) stock is rallying ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, with shares up 13% to $14.88 on Monday. This marked the stock's largest percentage increase since December 13, 2021. The so-called meme stock is still down 84% from its all-time high of $86.88, recorded on January 27, 2021. 

GameStop is scheduled to release its financial results for the quarter after the market closes on Tuesday. Considering the stock's volatile history, it is challenging to predict how its performance will reflect the company's underlying business. 

Wall Street anticipates earnings per share of 29 cents and revenue of $2.05 billion for the quarter. Investors are hoping for positive earnings results, given that the company's previous report, for Q4 2022, showed EPS of 16 cents and revenue of $2.23 billion. The release of the earnings report on Tuesday is set to be a significant catalyst for the video game and pop culture merchandise retailer. 

GameStop is aiming to diversify its production as its video gaming business has become outdated. As a global video game retailer, its performance and operating margins will be crucial to monitor in the upcoming report, as they may impact the stock price.

Short Interest remains very high as 22% of the float remains short. This is nearly $1 billion bet against GME. The stock has staunch resistance at the $15 level but that might entice short squeezers as it suggests a number of stops could be in this neighborhood. The potential for a short squeeze is further exasperated by the light participation which is usual for a holiday-shortened week. GME shares are trading nearly 3x daily volume today, highlighting the focus from the retail crowd.

It was a tough day for anyone who had difficulties finding positions, but it was a day full of opportunities to capitalize on the momentum in the markets and realize some gains.  

&#x200B;

Look to continually capitalize on the momentum in the markets, but please make sure you are walking on eggshells if you are attempting to go long in these market conditions. The only positions I would recommend you look into getting at this moment, are fundamentally solid organizations that are undervalued at the moment. There are lots of positions that would fall under this category. The two that I personally am looking at right now are $DIS and $DG. Both are very solid organizations that have some short-term issues that are negatively impacting them in these market conditions. These are just some of the few organizations that I personally have a lot of confidence in entering right now, as they are great companies that in the case the markets do decide to come down, will not be impacted as heavily as major tech organizations.

**Last Week – Slightly higher for stocks put plenty of volatility**.

SPY was up 1.1% on the week, a move less than half of what options were pricing. However, the market had multiple swings of more than 3% within the week and closed the week badly with a selloff on Friday. The VIX closed the week slightly higher but also saw large swings, nearly 30 on the upper end and 22 on the lower end. Last week’s volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation. Some of the best-performing stocks last week were in large-cap tech as a rotation to those names was spurred by lower interest rates and declining treasury yields.

Continuing signs of stress in the banking sector could spook stocks and confuse the options market, attempting to price both the downside market risk of bank runs and the potential for melt-ups happening elsewhere as rotations take place among investors eyeing declining yields (and a potentially dovish Fed). As one example among many, Microsft (MSFT) was higher by more than 12% last week, while KRE (the regional bank etf) was lower by 14%. Those type of competing moves resulted in an overall market that was almost flat on the week, but underneath the hood was some chaos.

Back to treasuries, short-term yields saw some of their wildest swings in years. For instance, the 2-year yield closed the week at 3.85%, down from 5% on March 7th. That’s a fast move. The bond market is essentially calling the Fed’s bluff on where rates will be in the near future. Speaking of the Fed…

**This Week – A Big Decision by The Fed**

A consortium of mid-sized banks sent a letter over the weekend to the FDIC requesting a rules change to guarantee deposits for the next two years in an attempt to stem further bank runs. A couple of weeks ago it was assumed the Fed would keep its foot on the gas on rate hikes and the market was settling into an assumption of higher rates for longer as inflation numbers remained somewhat stubborn. All that has now changed and the Fed has big decisions to make in the next few meetings. The FOMC announcement is Wednesday and a Powell presser follows. The market still assumes a 25 basis point hike (after some thought 50 just a few weeks ago) but a pause wouldn’t be a shock at this point. The reaction by the market to any of those scenarios would be tough to read ahead of time because the reasons given by the Fed are arguably more important.

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, similar to last week. The majority of the move is being priced by options for the actual FOMC day. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.6% expected move, about $400 on the upside and $380 on the downside. Note the bulge in the expected move chart mid-week, as option IV jumps from about 19 before the meeting to 26 after:

Millions of counterfeit naked short shares, it is going to the authorities."," Kolibri $KGEIF is an excellent investment growing and profitible, but PR just came out  **Shareholder Exposes Short Seller Manipulation in Shares of Kolibri Energy**   

 TORONTO, Feb. 13, 2023 /CNW/ - Harrington Global Opportunities Fund Limited (""Harrington""), announced today that it has been working in cooperation with Kolibri Global Energy Inc. (""Kolibri"") (TSX: KEI, OTCQX: KGEIF) to investigate anomalies in Kolibri's shareholdings. Harrington is Kolibri's third largest shareholder and beneficially owns or exercises control or direction over 4,077,050 common shares of Kolibri.

With the assistance of Shareholder Intelligence Services, LLC (""ShareIntel"") and Wes Christian of Christian Levin Law Group, and also relying on the resources of Buyins.net, Harrington has been able to establish the existence of persistent and significant share imbalances which Harrington has concluded demonstrates the likely existence of counterfeit shares in Kolibri.   Based upon the data compiled, there are potentially millions of counterfeit shares that have been manipulated into circulation. 

With 35.52 million shares outstanding, and an actively traded float of an estimated 10 million shares, the addition of such a large amount of counterfeit shares would act to significantly depress Kolibri's share price to the detriment of its shareholders and to Kolibri itself. Recordkeeping and reporting rules would also have been violated along with several provisions of Regulation SHO and the Fair Market Making Requirement.  Steps are being taken to address this matter with regulatory authorities and law enforcement.

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

|Expected Minimum Return|1.09%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|1.72%|
|Standard Deviation|13.11%|

&#x200B;

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data.

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash & Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

# RC Ventures LLC to $BBBY on 6th March 2022

**We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby, Inc. (“BABY”) and a full sale of the Company.**

**2. Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies**

Another path that can streamline Bed Bath’s strategy and **unlock value trapped within the Company’s underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner.** Given that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company’s entire market capitalization today. Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other ecommerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.

In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. **Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABY’s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers.**

**3. Evaluate a Full Sale to a Well-Capitalized Acquirer**

The final path we want to raise for consideration is a full sale of Bed Bath, in its current form, to one of the many well-capitalized financial sponsors with track records in the retail and consumer sectors and the ability to pay a meaningful premium. The past 10 years have shown that Bed Bath faces a difficult existence in the public market. The market is not giving the Company nearly enough credit for BABY’s value. A sale that can lock in a substantial premium for shareholders and provide Bed Bath the flexibility of the private market could be an ideal outcome for customers, employees and investors. **We believe Bed Bath presently satisfies financial sponsors’ interest in specialty retailers with recognizable brands, niche assets and sub-banners, and margin expansion opportunities.**

**A private market participant with a long-term vision could unlock meaningful value by running the core business for cash and initiating a public offering for BABY at the optimal time. After stripping out the sizable costs of being a public company and setting a more focused strategy, we suspect Bed Bath’s core business — excluding BABY — could generate attractive earnings.**

# How did Carl Ichan buy West Point Home?

""Trumping"" Seniority: Recent Decisions in Westpoint Stevens allow Bankruptcy Process to Undermine Intercreditor Terms Between First-Lien and Second-Lien Lenders.

**The** ***Westpoint*** **case involved a contest between two groups of secured lenders for control of the debtor's business.** The first group, led by Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., held a majority of the debtor's first-lien debt of $488 million. **The second group, led by Carl C. Icahn, held a majority of the second-lien debt of $165 million, and 40% of the first-lien debt.** When it appeared that a consensual plan was unattainable, the debtor proposed a Section 363 sale of its assets. **Following a bidding war between the groups at an auction, the Icahn group emerged the winner** and obtained approval from the bankruptcy court to purchase the debtor's assets under Section 363(b). **Under the terms of the Icahn group purchase, a new Icahn entity would purchase the Westpoint assets, the first and second liens would be released, and the equity in the new entity would be shared among the first-lien lenders** (which would receive shares valued at $489 million, the value of their first liens as determined in the sale order), the second-lien lenders (which would receive shares valued at $95 million), **and the Icahn group (which would purchase a stake in the new entity for $187 million in cash)**. **This sale structure assured that the Icahn group would obtain majority control of the debtor's business, through the equity in the new entity distributed to it on account of its first-lien and second-lien positions, combined with the equity interest it purchased with cash.**

***If all directors were representing Ryan Cohen, why is there not pressure to remove them following his sale in August. Because the Game is still on!***

# Why did Ryan Cohen sell his shares of BBBY on August 17th 2022?

**If you remember the start of August, out of nowhere the media started talking about Ryan Cohen buying Bed Bath & Beyond and the call options he owned.**

**But we all knew about this since March, why was it being pushed now!**

**I believe it was because the bonds were heavily discounted and Carl Ichan started buying them.**

**They then started to push the narrative of Ryan Cohen and Bed Bath to drive the price and the value of the bonds.**

**The value of the bonds were rising, Ryans holding was therefore turning against him as the media was using this to pump the stock and the bond values.**

**The lower the stock went and the lower the bonds went the better, RC could acquire more shares on the cheap and or Carl Ichan could buy more debt at discounted value.**

y7hyqv_MS,MS,Carl Ichan is not buying GME Shares!,"***I think its pretty obvious what's about to happen.***

***I believe Ryan Cohen only has interest in BABY and Gamestop is the buyer under Section 2 and he was already speaking with Carl Ichan about being the Well-Capitalized Acquirer under Section 3and that's why he says he believes*** **Bed Bath presently satisfies financial sponsors’ interest. Ryans motive was and still is to spin-off Baby. The post yesterday was to indirectly say that they have found an agreement.**

1. ***Carl Ichan to buy Bed Bath and Beyond***
2. ***Gamestop to buy Baby of Bed Bath and Beyong after Carl Ichan takes control***

# RC Ventures LLC to $BBBY on 6th March 2022

**We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby, Inc. (“BABY”) and a full sale of the Company.**

**2. Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies**

Another path that can streamline Bed Bath’s strategy and **unlock value trapped within the Company’s underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner.** Given that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company’s entire market capitalization today. Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other ecommerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.

In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. **Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABY’s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers.**

**3. Evaluate a Full Sale to a Well-Capitalized Acquirer**

The final path we want to raise for consideration is a full sale of Bed Bath, in its current form, to one of the many well-capitalized financial sponsors with track records in the retail and consumer sectors and the ability to pay a meaningful premium. The past 10 years have shown that Bed Bath faces a difficult existence in the public market. The market is not giving the Company nearly enough credit for BABY’s value. A sale that can lock in a substantial premium for shareholders and provide Bed Bath the flexibility of the private market could be an ideal outcome for customers, employees and investors. **We believe Bed Bath presently satisfies financial sponsors’ interest in specialty retailers with recognizable brands, niche assets and sub-banners, and margin expansion opportunities.**

**A private market participant with a long-term vision could unlock meaningful value by running the core business for cash and initiating a public offering for BABY at the optimal time. After stripping out the sizable costs of being a public company and setting a more focused strategy, we suspect Bed Bath’s core business — excluding BABY — could generate attractive earnings.**

# How did Carl Ichan buy West Point Home?

""Trumping"" Seniority: Recent Decisions in Westpoint Stevens allow Bankruptcy Process to Undermine Intercreditor Terms Between First-Lien and Second-Lien Lenders.

**The** ***Westpoint*** **case involved a contest between two groups of secured lenders for control of the debtor's business.** The first group, led by Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., held a majority of the debtor's first-lien debt of $488 million. **The second group, led by Carl C. Icahn, held a majority of the second-lien debt of $165 million, and 40% of the first-lien debt.** When it appeared that a consensual plan was unattainable, the debtor proposed a Section 363 sale of its assets. **Following a bidding war between the groups at an auction, the Icahn group emerged the winner** and obtained approval from the bankruptcy court to purchase the debtor's assets under Section 363(b). **Under the terms of the Icahn group purchase, a new Icahn entity would purchase the Westpoint assets, the first and second liens would be released, and the equity in the new entity would be shared among the first-lien lenders** (which would receive shares valued at $489 million, the value of their first liens as determined in the sale order), the second-lien lenders (which would receive shares valued at $95 million), **and the Icahn group (which would purchase a stake in the new entity for $187 million in cash)**. **This sale structure assured that the Icahn group would obtain majority control of the debtor's business, through the equity in the new entity distributed to it on account of its first-lien and second-lien positions, combined with the equity interest it purchased with cash.**

***I believe they will focus on the carve out of BABY carve out under point 2 of RC Ventures Letter***

**Carl Ichan - Shelly C. Lombard**

I believe **Shelly C. Lombard represent Carl Ichan** in structuring the indirect buyout of Bed Bath & Beyond through acquired the BBBY debt and exchanging it for equity to take control. Similar to how Carl Ichan took control of West Point Home.

There was no mention of **Shelly C. Lombard looking at Baby so what is she there to do? WHat is her expertise**

**Biography from Bend Bath & Beyond Website**

Ms. Lombard currently serves as an independent consultant, focusing on investment analysis and financial training. She has over 30 years of experience analyzing, valuing, and investing in companies. **Prior to becoming a consultant**, **she served as Director of High Yield and Special Situation Research for Britton Hill Capital, a broker dealer specializing in high yield and special situation bank debt and bonds and value equities,** from 2011 to 2014. **Prior to that**, she was a high yield and **special situation bond analyst and was also involved in analyzing, managing, and restructuring proprietary investments for various financial institutions.** She was named by NACD as one of its 100 Directorship Honorees for 2021. Ms. Lombard brings strong financial analysis, investment, capital markets, and public company director experience to our Board.

***I believe she will focus on buyout and change of control of Bend Bath & Beyond in a structure similar to how Carl Ichan bought West Point Home***

***If all directors were representing Ryan Cohen, why is there not pressure to remove them following his sale in August. Because the Game is still on!***

# Why did Ryan Cohen sell his shares of BBBY on August 17th 2022?

**If you remember the start of August, out of nowhere the media started talking about Ryan Cohen buying Bed Bath & Beyond and the call options he owned.**

**But we all knew about this since March, why was it being pushed now!**

**I believe it was because the bonds were heavily discounted and Carl Ichan started buying them.**

**They then started to push the narrative of Ryan Cohen and Bed Bath to drive the price and the value of the bonds.**

**The value of the bonds were rising, Ryans holding was therefore turning against him as the media was using this to pump the stock and the bond values.**

**The lower the stock went and the lower the bonds went the better, RC could acquire more shares on the cheap and or Carl Ichan could buy more debt at discounted value.**

**A value that truly represents the situation the company is in and not a pumped value created by the media.**

# The BBBY September 29th Update

A lot of disappointment, all the hype pushed for another day. However hidden in the 10Q was this little gem.

10Q - [Source](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/5def01b1-cf9d-4c64-b2fe-d5c9c4edd750)

The Company is considering liability management transactions with particular focus on the 2024 bonds. Transactions could be launched in the third quarter and could include offers to **exchange our current debt for new longer tenured debt or equity at exchange ratios related to the then-current value of the current debt**. However, the transactions could take other forms or might not be launched at all.

wv6e6g_PATH,PATH,The GME Anomaly and the Slow March,"I'm posting this on a burner account because posting from my main would be compromising in a bad way. 

If you aren't familiar, there's a community-created direct registration tracker that has for the last two earnings  accurately anticipated the amount of registered shares. 

[The white points represent the official figures from GameStop, with the blue plot being the trimmed average of user-submitted entries.](https://imgur.com/a/eKJuMm5)

At the time of posting, this tool is estimating that roughly ~48% of GameStop's public float is directly registered. About ~80 million shares are owned by retail investors. And it largely baffles me that more people aren't talking about this. I believe that this is unprecedented (I might go as far as saying that I *know* this is unprecedented). It's uncharted territory. I think I remember doing some napkin math and coming up with an estimate that it would take ~4 years for half of the public float to be registered. This was around the time DTC withdrawal was first discussed in the GameStop forums (maybe in August of last year?), and I think I made the error of assuming that there wouldn't be a kind of memetic contagion (that or I'm terrible at math). 

This is to say: GameStop ""Apes"" are doing something incredibly strange at an incredibly quick, if not near impossible, pace. If this continues (at *this pace*), there is a very good chance that by next August/September the majority of publicly traded shares will be individually registered to who knows how many people. And that's weird. That is enough right there, I think, to re-evaluate the whole meme-stock frenzy. It was for me, at least. I very much wrote off the whole phenomenon until a colleague brought the tracker to my attention.  

If you want to understand my thinking better: here we have a highly retail-driven instrument that is quickly becoming illiquid. I know social sentiment is largely disregarded as ""soft"", but as evidenced by the last week, it is a salient driver of price action. A *vast* majority of GameStop investors are not selling these registered shares (or at least say they aren't). GameStop's turnover rate has plummeted in the last few months, and intraday volume is miniscule barring extreme/sudden movements. This is independently verifiable with whatever data provider you use. 

I originally called it a slow march. 
It's at least a spirited waddle now. 

I anticipate it to increase somewhat, without taking too strong a position in either direction. However, basic newtonian physics tells us two things: it's *really* hard to get a massive object moving, and equally difficult to get it to stop. 

I envision a horrific, gigantic ball of monkeys just starting to roll down a hill, with some clueless octogenarian in a top hat right in its path. I hope that's a colorful illustration. 

Now, before I get bombarded (not that it matters because I plan to ditch this account right after I post this), I will say a few things: 

1. I know for a fact that GameStop will not reach some $xxx million per share. It's completely impossible. Anything else is wishful thinking. Even *if* there are many *n* times the float of ""synthetic"" shares, there is simply not enough money in the world (the entire history of it) to reach those prices. I cannot believe I have to explicitly say this, but here we are. 
2. I do not care about Ryan Cohen. I have no strong feelings in either direction. This post is not about Ryan Cohen. Please, for the love of all that is good, do not conflate this post as being about Ryan Cohen. Please.
3. I do not own *any* GameStop. No positions, no stake in this. I am making this post purely out of the desire to have discussion on the most popular... financial... forum on this website. 
4. (Final and most important point) the tracker very well may be wrong. We have, what, a week or so? To see if it's still acceptably accurate. I do anticipate it to be, as a model with as much data and previously verified trends as this one to be hideously inaccurate would be highly anomalous. Nothing is impossible, however.  

Take of this what you will. Take care. Be kind. Make money.",2022-08-22,2487,691

Crucially, Cohen also purchased 2023 call options on BBBY shares, with strike prices ranging between $60 and $80. For reference, the stock closed on Friday at $12.95 per share. While these bullish bets had appeared outlandish back in March, given the ongoing short squeeze in BBBY shares, it remains within the realm of the possible that Ryan Cohen’s call options enter the in-the-money territory. Even if that does not occur, any rally that takes the stock above $30 – which was the stock’s rough price level toward the end of March – will result in outsized gains for Cohen on the back of the increase in these options’ intrinsic value.

GME among the top 10 most unprofitable stocks for short sellers during July 2022," Gamestop GME short sellers have lost $443.4 million so far this month. $GME is among the top 10 most unprofitable stocks for short sellers during July 2022. All GMErs out there, are you still long?

Shares of GameStop (GME) - Get GameStop Corporation Report are trading higher again in June, helped by catalysts such as the launch of the company's NFT marketplace and a stock split.

In fact, GameStop shares have managed to outperform the S&P 500 so far this year. And they've also managed to cause big losses for short sellers who insist on betting against the stock.

According to a report published by S3 Partners on July 21, GameStop has been among the top 10 most unprofitable stocks for short sellers during July 2022. So far this month, short sellers have already lost $443.4 million on GME.

 It's worth noting that, compared to the many large-cap companies on the list, GameStop's average borrow fee is incredibly elevated — 32%.

Borrow fees are the amount that short sellers must pay to ""borrow"" shares of the stock and open a short position.

However, following the report and GameStop's 4-for-1 stock split, fees reached a sky-high 126%:

vxkh68_KO,KO,The ACTUAL business model for GameStop & NFT!,"Say u bought some digital version of a game, say on PC (steam,etc.) or ps4/5, xbox, wii, etc. and u want to sell the game to someone else when your done or bored of it, like how in the old days with physical games, there was GameStop stores as the middle man (the physical marketplace)… now … with the GameStop NFT Marketplace, if a game developer/studio onboards, they can enable the digital resale of games, and each time a used game trades hand, GME gets 2.5% commissions, like how a credit card company does as processing fees, and the original game development company can get a 10% cut for each and every time a “used digital game” exchanges hands, THEREFORE the used game market is modernized and is brought back to life in the digital world.. now the same thing applies with used digital anything, from movies (like my collection of iTunes movies I’ve paid for) and my selectively paid for digital collection of music albums on various platforms… this is what they’re ultimate plan is, hence they only charge 2.5% commissions because GME plans to be a large volume processor and won’t want to compete with or been seen as a threat to the existing digital distribution ecosystem. Instead they would want to partner with them and enable these companies to make more money from the huge volumes of digital assets people already paid for and eager to make a resale! Knowing that I can resell my iTunes movies will allow me to binge purchase movies!

And….

Imagine if GTA game started allowing you to actually buy and sell weapons and clothes and etc. for real money on an exchange with other players using a low fee NFT exchange that everyone already knows and trusts! The entire game industry is going cash money! The global games market is NOW over $180 BILLION, which is more than movie and music industry combined!

TLDR;

GME will push forward with … 

1) NFT as we know it yesterday… speculative digital art?

2) NFT exchange to facilitate tradable progress/achievements within games (think GTA guns & gear) between players.

3) NFT as a resale marketplace for used digital games/movies/music by becoming a large volume processor like Visa.

This is like investing in Apple when it was about to go bankrupt and Microsoft had to bail them out!!

To the moon, and build a base!
BUY, HODL, DRS!

Etoro Rep = "" Please note that we have yet to receive any information regarding this split. When we do we, will update our clients accordingly.

eToro’s policy in response to a split is to adjust the opening rate of the trade-in question to reflect the new rates after the split. This also ensures that all subsequent profit calculations are proportionately correct.

In summation, the price of the instrument and the number of units in the positions may change, but the value of all positions remains the same.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.""

Dumb Ape = ""I would like clarification if the gme split will be direct shares or cash equivalents.""

Etoro Rep = "" Please be advised that dividend payments are paid out only in cash.

When a stock goes ex-dividend, it will typically open the following morning at a lower rate depending on the amount of the dividend and market sentiment. The price gap of individual stocks causes the index in which the stock is a component to open at a lower rate as well.

vtrdt5_V,V,GME just laid off 20% of corporate staff,"While everyone is pissing themselves in glee over the 4 way stock split, GameStop is at this very moment laying off 20% of their corporate staff.  I have a friend who works there in Grapevine and it’s still ongoing.

I know what you apes are probably thinking: that this is good, they’re trimming the fat, RC Cola and friends will remain and save the day - the layoff INCLUDES new hires from Chewie and Amazon.  Say what you want about the future of the company, but 20% layoffs are never a good sign.  I have a pretty good feeling that Royal Caribbean’s resurrection plan isn’t going so great.  His success with Chewie is starting to look less like mastery of business and more like right place at the right time.

twwzbr_VTI,VTI,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers,"**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs. The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read.

# Background Information

I'm rewording a previous post and adding another fund onto it... Going to try and make it easier to understand.

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker dealer (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

Thinking of that example, funds are currently lending GME shares to broker dealers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold.

The [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar exposure to securities lending counterparty risks as the broker dealers did who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The broker dealers currently borrowing and lending GME have a [similar exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) to what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic from AIG... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** loaning the GME shares. So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares in the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds contain shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the first post I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

* 138 of 213 funds were loaning GME shares
* 70 funds lent out more than 90% of their GME shares
* An estimated 5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending), and
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) in the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * Note: You'll need to see ""GME Deep Dive: So Much GME Lending"" in my profile for the original post with this info. I have it pinned.

That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund... I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks at the bottom of this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:

[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/7lddv0rb8pr81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a13147fbe642ce67f51476bec0636f4497fbcd4)

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/88b90mog8pr81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a2fe6803e0f02f217938829139f785e82cc17d)

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

https://preview.redd.it/o67gkzxc9pr81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=502bec7e2d34818c3da305caadf38eec9fe83787

The ***fund*** has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:

[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/4q0mn82g9pr81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=6188e2ff74c05db37c78b0ed51acbb6cb033eae5)

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

Many other funds loaning GME shares have similar looking securities borrowers, shareholders, and fund holdings compared to the three funds we've just reviewed. That's a lot of securities lending counterparty risk when you considered the amount of funds loaning GME shares (over 5.72M shares by 138 funds).

Remember, this is just lending from mutual funds and ETFs and does not include other avenues for lending GME shares.

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

*Buckle Up*

Tanks fo reedin

**Note:** I have not extensively reviewed all funds and fund holdings, but GME appears to be one of the most loaned securities held by these funds, if not the most loaned, BUT there is a SUBSTANTIAL amount of securities lending currently happening with these funds so I can't be certain where GME falls.

**Note 2:** I'll leave the post with these quotes that I used in my original post regarding counterparty risk:

**The Counterparty Risk**

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However, in recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can’t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

tvgb6i_GM,GM,"""bUT AMc iS CHeapEr ThAN GmE !!!"" Proven Wrong With Data","# Intro

Recently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of ""POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME"" or ""Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?"" or my personal favorite ""if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!"".

All of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.

Here are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a ""DD"" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886

https://preview.redd.it/zcg55iz2zcr81.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad8385b7a0c05247784da5d62ce52bf253744a3

There are others, but you get my point.

&#x200B;

# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.

Here is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:

If company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.

If this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.

This ""trick"" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.

The psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a ""deal"" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.

&#x200B;

# The Proof

I took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54

The X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.

&#x200B;

# Let's do a hypothetical.

If you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.

(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)

I'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.

Now, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.

As of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.

In this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.

In the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.

But price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want. NFA.

# I. Elliot Waves and Fibo:

https://preview.redd.it/44h7jobja7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28783785d3c2fc25de11c9b21221d0b1a1d9e535

  
The horizontal 🌈 lines you see on the chart above is the Fibonacci retracement tool, the measurement starting point is applied to April 3rd 2020 low of about three bucks (shorting hedgies surprised Pikachu face type of reversal), and the top point is Jan 27th 2021 inter-day high of about $450; this period constitutes GME phoenix-like reversal and the first chapter of the short squeeze of everything (squeeze your nuts yourself you fucking bot). Just a quick reminder, that Fibo is used by ‘traders (anagram)’ for measuring the potential corrective move, and 0.786 Fibo is a sweet and attractive level to hug and support the 2nd, corrective Elliot Wave - EW (for the in-depth discussion of why 0.786 is the perfect level for the price to touch down during a correction, refer to the Big Short 2.0 linked in the second paragraph of this post). All in all, 78.6% retracement level is one of the strongest support levels for the global bull trends that exist, and GME recent price action is the perfect manifestation of that. Therefore I really doubt that we will go below $100 in the near future.

04|03|20-01|27|21 bullish price action used for initial Fibo measurement, imho, also awesomely corresponds to the first Elliot wave of the global bullish impulse. The rest of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 price action incorporates into corrective EW 2 perfectly, in its turn. This one is characterized by lengthy consolidation around $180 (average) followed by a tasty 0.786 dip. The new-born Feb 2022 uptrend is just the beginning of the fresh 3rd EW intensive bullrun, and let me quote Wikipedia here, on its characteristics:

“Wave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend. The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone looking to ""get in on a pullback"" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave three's midpoint, ""the crowd"" will often join the new bullish trend.”

Wave 3 is my favorite EW, and for GME it will be juiiiicy!

  


# II. The year-long resistance and moving averages:

https://preview.redd.it/bmn9exjsa7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75294d0b4fd86a9ec1746554189201056d8b5138

This one is really interesting. Take a look at two pink resistance lines first. The thinner, straight one is what I originally identified as the main 2021 GME resistance about half a year ago: all of the previous cyclical bull runs (as well as the original January Sneeze breakout) were caught by it and subsequently reversed; three out of four from those cycles resulted in the powerful false breakouts - which illustrates grotesque selling pressure above this trend line (margin call protection squad maybe?). The dramatic reversal and subsequent bearish price action of each cyclical pattern take up to 90% of each cycle, and that automated, algorithms driven nasty pattern is aimed at keeping the broader investors circle uninterested in the asset, while trying to exhaust the existing buyers and shake weak hands. Well, it looks like there are no weak hands left (thanks 0.786 Fibo supportive buying pressure, coming mostly from 💎🙌💎 direct registering shares), so buckle the fuck up, autist, this rocket goes to moon with or without you.

Furthermore, take a look at the thicker, curved pink resistance which is steeper than the one discussed previously - this reflects additional ~~short dick pain~~ selling pressure inserted on the stonk starting last November. This beautiful smooth line covers all of the false breakouts - and it also incorporates the complete EW2 price action, acting as a resistance through Dec21-Jan22 (almoasst on the chart above) and currently (LFG). You may notice on the chart above, that the price is now trapped between pink curved resistance and the red 21 day exponential moving average - which acts as a strong local support for the newly commenced bull trend.

Speaking of moving averages. 21D exponential MA is used by traders for identifying the trend locally. For GME it clearly acted as an intermediate support during the uptrend phase of the cycle morphing into resistance for the bearish phase (check the chart above for sup/res). Now it’s SUP, and flipping sup/res usually last for weeks! 80, 150 and 200 day are major simple moving averages which are used for a longer term trend identification, and those were rejected as supports one by one in Jul, Oct, and Dec 2021 accordingly. Now they act as magnetising resistance levels, begging for the penetration from the downside - if you know what I mean.

The parameters outlined above represent the major resistance zone of $120-$200, breaking through which will shoot the apes into space. Wen break? etaSon:

# III. RSI and cycles:

https://preview.redd.it/bvc5vkcya7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2d3c1f8816927ab2f56085903bb8234ba3ee310

Futures cycles theory simplified for dummies through TA: check RSI at the bottom, which perfectly structures into the u/W shaped cycles - where peak zones correspond with the quarterly futures rollover dates/periods. Firstly, this RSI trending does not look like normal behavior at all. GG, take a look at this gay bear robo algo pathetic shorting, instead of Porn Hub for once, damn it!

Each time, after that red RSI downtrend completes, we approach quarterly bullrun’s acceleration (purple arrows pointing up). Notice, how Relative Strength Index shoots to its upper gray resistance towards the end of each cycle, and currently we have plenty of RSI upside left. That, in turn, points at the aggressive bullrun in the next couple of trading days. Especially considering that:

GME 4H chart, cup and handle completed LFG Cup and handle reversal formation has just been completed on 4H, just above diamond handed 0.786 Fibo support, which is ultra bullish. Who ordered nuclear sandwich for breakfast: notice, how the shape has been forming in between blue Fib and pink year-long resistance, and how handle is supported by daily 21 EMA - what a goddamn juicy technical picture! All that is left is to FUK!

# V. In conclusion, I came:

**TR;CR: GME is set for one of the strongest breakouts and bullruns since Jan 2021. The price action, which had been suppressed through the entire year, has just bounced off the strongest supports that exist, that is 78.6% retracement level (of the entire bullrun from $3). Furthermore, the stonk is entering Elliot Wave 3, that has to be the most intensive one in the structure. Locally, a juicy cup and handle formation has just been completed, which is set to send the price action to 170-200 range, penetrating and conquering the most important resistance zone. The local price action is further supported by 21 exponential moving average, and the futures cycle completion will also push the price hard in the next couple of trading days. All in all, lets fuk, LG!**

The new-born Feb 2022 uptrend is just the beginning of the fresh 3rd EW intensive bullrun, and let me quote Wikipedia here, on its characteristics:

“Wave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend. The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone looking to ""get in on a pullback"" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave three's midpoint, ""the crowd"" will often join the new bullish trend.”

Wave 3 is my favorite EW, and for GME it will be juiiiicy!

  


# II. The year-long resistance and moving averages:

https://preview.redd.it/bmn9exjsa7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75294d0b4fd86a9ec1746554189201056d8b5138

This one is really interesting. Take a look at two pink resistance lines first. The thinner, straight one is what I originally identified as the main 2021 GME resistance about half a year ago: all of the previous cyclical bull runs (as well as the original January Sneeze breakout) were caught by it and subsequently reversed; three out of four from those cycles resulted in the powerful false breakouts - which illustrates grotesque selling pressure above this trend line (margin call protection squad maybe?). The dramatic reversal and subsequent bearish price action of each cyclical pattern take up to 90% of each cycle, and that automated, algorithms driven nasty pattern is aimed at keeping the broader investors circle uninterested in the asset, while trying to exhaust the existing buyers and shake weak hands. Well, it looks like there are no weak hands left (thanks 0.786 Fibo supportive buying pressure, coming mostly from 💎🙌💎 direct registering shares), so buckle the fuck up, autist, this rocket goes to moon with or without you.

Furthermore, take a look at the thicker, curved pink resistance which is steeper than the one discussed previously - this reflects additional ~~short dick pain~~ selling pressure inserted on the stonk starting last November. This beautiful smooth line covers all of the false breakouts - and it also incorporates the complete EW2 price action, acting as a resistance through Dec21-Jan22 (almoasst on the chart above) and currently (LFG). You may notice on the chart above, that the price is now trapped between pink curved resistance and the red 21 day exponential moving average - which acts as a strong local support for the newly commenced bull trend.

Speaking of moving averages. 21D exponential MA is used by traders for identifying the trend locally. For GME it clearly acted as an intermediate support during the uptrend phase of the cycle morphing into resistance for the bearish phase (check the chart above for sup/res). Now it’s SUP, and flipping sup/res usually last for weeks! 80, 150 and 200 day are major simple moving averages which are used for a longer term trend identification, and those were rejected as supports one by one in Jul, Oct, and Dec 2021 accordingly. Now they act as magnetising resistance levels, begging for the penetration from the downside - if you know what I mean.

The parameters outlined above represent the major resistance zone of $120-$200, breaking through which will shoot the apes into space. Wen break? etaSon:

# III. RSI and cycles:

Futures cycles theory simplified for dummies through TA: check RSI at the bottom, which perfectly structures into the u/W shaped cycles - where peak zones correspond with the quarterly futures rollover dates/periods. Firstly, this RSI trending does not look like normal behavior at all. GG, take a look at this gay bear robo algo pathetic shorting, instead of Porn Hub for once, damn it!

Each time, after that red RSI downtrend completes, we approach quarterly bullrun’s acceleration (purple arrows pointing up). Notice, how Relative Strength Index shoots to its upper gray resistance towards the end of each cycle, and currently we have plenty of RSI upside left. That, in turn, points at the aggressive bullrun in the next couple of trading days. Especially considering that:

GME 4H chart, cup and handle completed LFG Cup and handle reversal formation has just been completed on 4H, just above diamond handed 0.786 Fibo support, which is ultra bullish. Who ordered nuclear sandwich for breakfast: notice, how the shape has been forming in between blue Fib and pink year-long resistance, and how handle is supported by daily 21 EMA - what a goddamn juicy technical picture! All that is left is to FUK!

# V. In conclusion, I came:

**TR;CR: GME is set for one of the strongest breakouts and bullruns since Jan 2021. The price action, which had been suppressed through the entire year, has just bounced off the strongest supports that exist, that is 78.6% retracement level (of the entire bullrun from $3). Furthermore, the stonk is entering Elliot Wave 3, that has to be the most intensive one in the structure. Locally, a juicy cup and handle formation has just been completed, which is set to send the price action to 170-200 range, penetrating and conquering the most important resistance zone. The local price action is further supported by 21 exponential moving average, and the futures cycle completion will also push the price hard in the next couple of trading days. All in all, lets fuk, LG!**

MACD and RSI you should know, if not, wait for Cramer to tell you about it on CNBC ya boomer.  

The sequence to look for with GME is:  

*	The Boom Pro Signal line (the WHITE line amongst the agglomeration of Center of Gravity a.k.a COG oscillators) finds a bottom after a high point.  

*	The Red COG cloud establishes an uptrend.  

*	The signal line finds resistance (red line) in it’s first top after the red cloud has established it’s uptrend. (YELLOW circles)  

*	When the signal line breaks the resistance (red line) the rocket is launching (GREEN vertical line)  

*	This is confirmed by MACD, RSI, and a stochastic pop indicator made by another guy who fucks:  https://www.tradingview.com/u/ChrisMoody/  

As you can see this is a leading indicator strategy with multiple confirms, with a high success rate for GME.

However, SPY traded in a $15 range and was higher by about $10 and lower by about $5 during the week. Implied volatility was higher on the week with the VIX closing on Friday above 30.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 2.4% move (about $11 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY 453.50 that is a range of about 442.50 to 464.50.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 30.50, up from around 28 to start the week. That means expected moves are large (historically) in all the market ETFs, particularly the QQQ and IWM:

r3p60z_GME,GME,Bull $GME spreads for (actual) free money,"I decided to open a Jan 2023 GME LEAPS on Friday because I noticed how out of whack the far OTM options are priced: [https://imgur.com/lDl362g](https://imgur.com/lDl362g)

\~$23 for a $950 strike expiring in about 400 days... 6,500 OI... those buyers need GME to go up $773 from Friday's close in that time \*just to reach breakeven.\* This, obviously, creates a pretty sizable discount on an ATM LEAPS- my $210C's profit point goes down from $288 to $265.

If you are long GME but do not believe the stock will squeeze to $10,000,000 in the next 14 months this is a no-brainer. And if that does happen, congrats to r/Superstonk. You would still stand to make a measly $62k per spread.

For the past few weeks, it's obvious that the calls have been leading, as you can see on the chart below. The green and purple bars at the bottom are not volume bars, they represent premiums. As you can see, recent sessions have been overwhelmingly biased towards the call side.

WASHINGTON—A trading frenzy in shares of GameStop Corp. [US:GME] shares earlier this year raised a number of questions for regulators but didn’t expose major weaknesses in stock-market infrastructure, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday.

A highly anticipated SEC report attributed the episode primarily to a rapid increase in trading by individual investors, many of whom used social-media platforms like Reddit to swap ideas and strategies. The agency poured cold water on a number of alternative hypotheses for why the struggling videogame retailer’s share price soared from less than $20 at the end of 2020 to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28.

The SEC also found no evidence to support theories that gained traction on social media around brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc.’s [US:HOOD] decision to restrict trading in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that day.

The SEC said shortening the amount of time it takes for brokers to clear equity trades from the current period of two days could make the market less risky during times of heightened volatility. It also said more reporting of short sales—a method of betting a stock’s price will decline—could help regulators monitor markets.",2021-10-18,1555,156

pmzz5j_GME,GME,GameStop (GME) Recent Stock Float History,"I tried posting this on another subreddit but it didn't work. I thought it might be of interest to people here. I went through my archives and put together the attached chart of GME stock float and short interest over the last several months. As everyone has noticed, the float number recently reported by Yahoo Finance looks to be off. I can't explain why, but based on my experience with such data, float does not fluctuate that greatly on a day to day basis. It will be interesting to see what the data bears out over the next several days. I hope this is of interest to followers of GameStop stock (I currently hold no positions in GME).

plo2yy_GME,GME,What do GME apes see as the endgame?,"Perhaps a lot of us here hold some GME (myself included) because you believe in it, or just want to hop in on the fun. But I'm having trouble finding logical answers to basic questions regarding the theoretical squeeze. It's a cult over in superstonk and GME subs, can't get straight answers. 

The squeeze theory at it's core hinges on hedge funds needing to cover a massive short that includes millions of synthetic Gamestock shares. When it eventually must reconcile, the share price will moon to 5K, 50K, 500K etc. Per share. Some even believe a single share could reach millions of dollars. (!) 

My question I can't seem to get an answer to is: who actually pays this theoretical megafortune out? If billion or trillions are owed to cover, the hedgefunds go under. The market makers go under, and there's a domino effect. The US economy tanks. Is that the idea? Or the gov steps in for a bailout, which at this scale also would be a catastrophic event. Either way, what would the USD be worth in those scenarios, even if you had millions of it. 

Do apes truly believe the endgame is something like this? Or am I missing something...",2021-09-10,194,325

**Last Week** – SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week** – SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.5%**
* DIA **0.8%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.5%**
* DIA **0.8%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move. It's tight, but that's what a 16 VIX looks like vs Condors and other OTM credit spreads.

**In the News**

Covid booster shots are now a topic of conversation and Pfizer (PFE) may be available for a roll-out by the end of September with their FDA review scheduled for the 17th. Moderna (MRNA) will likely lag Pfizer and officials are recommending those that had the Moderna shots to wait for a Moderna booster. There is no timeline yet for review of a Johnson & Johnson booster. Here's how options are pricing expected moves for those three stocks out to October 1st:

* PFE 4.5%
* MRNA 12%
* JNJ 2.5%

pcb42r_GM,GM,"AMC and GME Prediction's, and Some of todays trades I took","GME  Bullish I see GME opening with a little bit of weakness. I will be looking to buy calls around the 200-195 range. I then see a Push up to the 210 range, we could see some resistance there and possibly pull back or blow right through. But overall I believe that the 210 range will be broken. Reaching my price target of 220-227. These are the levels I will be looking to trade tomorrow.

I'm going to choke vlad the fuck out if I ever see him on the street which is probably never going to happen. A man can dream though.

This decentralized crypto exchange called Merrymen is allocating 20% of their shit to anyone who has been affected by the Robinhood GME fiasco. So if you've got some screenshots, I'd hold on to them because it will earn you some free money.

op00jd_GME,GME,Your Thoughts on $GME Thesis,"Hello I want to start by saying before this year I didn’t know anything about the market. I’m still not well-versed in it but I have been learning more and more, mostly through analysis of $GME DD on reddit.

I want to step out of the confirmation bias chamber and ask y’all about your thought on the $GME thesis:

- Hedge funds have naked shorted GameStop and the “meme stocks” to oblivion, the entire float several times over.

- Retail (and some Institutions) have been buying and holding since January, owning more than the actual float.

- Price is manipulated through dark pools, so even though these past days buy orders ounumber sell orders 7 to 1, it trades sideways or dips.

- These conditions have set up $GME to have the Mother of All Short Squeezes. If and when the short positions must close, their losses are theoretically infinite.

-Moass aside, GameStops fundamentals have changed. All debt paid off, $2 Billion cash on hand from direct offerings, expanding product line, e-commerce experts on C-suite team, crypto/NFT in production, and Ryan Cohen leading it all.


The bear thesis in my opinion no longer holds any water. I don’t see how this company can go bankrupt any time soon. And if it’s not going bankrupt, what do the short hedge funds have to gain from continuing to short and manipulate it other than living to die another day?

Y’all are, I’m assuming, seasoned and traditional investors. Whats your take on $GME’s bull thesis?",2021-07-21,3,37

ojnpu9_SOFI,SOFI,"Daily Option Statistics for AMC, CLOV, GME, NOK, SPCE, AAPL, BB, TSLA, SOFI, WISH and others.","Hey everyone,

Good afternoon. As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.

The biggest news of the day was NOK. A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit.

Other then that just a normal day. AMC(-7.65%), GME(-4.86%), and SPCE(-7.20%) were the biggest losers today. Everyone else kind of just slid around.

Below are the statistics for today.

o3oskb_GME,GME,$CLOV- Serious Discussion: Is this stock the actual dark horse.. AMC & GME prepared us for???,"Is CLOV the true Dark Horse???

The technical setup:

It is rumored that over 50% of the available float is current shorted. However there is evidence 95% of the available float is in shorted-interests positions. The reason for the in discrepancy is because of they way they are counting Greenoaks capital’s holdings.

Greenoak’s shares are being counted and listed as a part of the available 155m float, however it has been uncovered that Greenoaks holds 93m in Class B shares that are convertible to class A. None of the shares have been converted, the paper work to covert the shares has not been filed and the shares are not currently available. At the same time these facts have surfaced,  there has been a big and coordinated push to suppress CLOV from trending. FUD has ran rampant this 1.5 weeks… it raised eyebrows when BoA coincidentally downgraded the stock.. as momentum began to spike up…. It should be noted that BoA has a decent short-interest position… 

Connecting the dots…

In recent weeks as institutions have been under the radar adding and accumulating short positions in growth sectors  on a separate but related trending topic “inflation” we have been witness to wall-street has been sounding the dog-whistle about inflation and how it’s not transitory. Those of you who know the markets and understand cyclicals know that these institutions and HF managers have been  in collusion on convincing the FED to raise rates….They know that would cause a market cool down to promote a rotation out of growth sectors. This is an efforts to drive the sector down so they can successfully close positions and make money on the pullback. The fed didn’t raise rates and those institutions and funds that prematurely took positions are nervous that they could be the next Melvin Capital if they get over leveraged in short-interest positions… 

Digging into the #’s

CLOV short interest is speculated to be above 90%.. but even at reported levels of +50% the stock is way over shorted,  if/when that  information gets out it will warrant a feeding aka buying frenzy.. 

I challenge everyone to take a little time and do your own DD.. 

Here is the Link to the 13G SEC filing that show Greenoaks Capital Partners shares as class b:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001801170/000090266421001020/p21-0536sc13g.htm

Giving further validity to this, it is rumored that CLOV was left off the 2021 Russell 2000 rebalance list due to not having enough voting shares available among its current common stock float 

Nasdaq List 184 institutional holders:

156,065,359 total shares held 
96,331,338 shares held by Greenoaks capital 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/institutional-holdings

If DD is correct that means only: 59,734,021 available float

Short interest on 5/28 was reported at 41,274,556

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/short-interest

That equates to 69.09 % it is rumored that short interest has increased 5-15% over the first 2 weeks of June.. those numbers should be out Monday. 

More of the numbers:

⁠CLOV

48.45% Short Interest with 100% utilization and super high costs to borrow according to ORTEX (6/19)

•	⁠100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)

•	⁠$700,000,000 in cash, no debt

•	⁠No threat of stock dilutions 

•	⁠Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is &gt;$30 for 90 days

•	⁠Citadel owns 7x more AMC than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.

•	⁠Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)

•	⁠Shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely), released “timely” information 🙄 about a DOJ investigation from months ago that didn’t go anywhere

•	⁠Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Post 6/8 run up there has been a desperate and frenzied efforts to spread FUD. Then another sub (to remain nameless) started removing all CLOV post and DD to control the narrative additionally in the “moderated” post we only saw propaganda downplaying CLOV as an attempt by HFs to distract attention away from GME and AMC and accusing this sub of being a HF’s (note the sub is only growing strong because of the FUD and unfair policing of CLOV post on other SUBs)

To continue: Since the $28 mini-pop on 6/8 

All these subsequent actions!!!!

 It makes me think that we have only seen a FRACTION of what is really hidden behind the reported numbers. 

There is a huge coordinated effort to suppress this information… I challenge all of you in this sub to follow the links and do your own DD… then come back with your findings and add to the discussion. It looking more and more like CLOV is the dark horse in this race.

Remember:

We buy the rumor and sell the news…

nv3ib3_SLV,SLV,We Need Separate Daily Megathreads For GME / AMC / BB / CLOV,"Having a hundred BB posts a day is pulling out momentum AMC and GME have from this community. It's the same problem we had with GME a couple months ago - the big difference being BB is still not showing comparable gains, and it's not even shorted. So where is *this* amount of support coming from?

Don't get me wrong - I have shares in BB and would love it to moon, but the amount of AMC/GME FUD going on from new accounts where 100% of their post history is pushing BB or fucking SILVER is blowing my mind. That shit's not organic and we see through your bullshit. Again, I say this as someone who's been holding BB since January.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay.

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

na2wye_GME,GME,GME Put/Call Parity breaks apart,"In an interesting development this week, GME put/call parity, which has tracked like any normal stock for months, started to split apart this week and today really fractured.

Put/Call parity implies that both the put and call will have (about) the same IV at the same strike. I have been using a model to track GME IV for, among other things, an at-the-money strangle since Jan 27, 2021, recorded in the database at around 1:00 PM ET.  

My models calculate implied daily volatility (IDV) rather than annual volatility. I am always tracking a monthly so currently the May 21.

GME ATM IV has declined steadily and in a very orderly way and showing relative parity since late March. IV was extremely high in March but began a relentless decline. There was some asymmetry - put IDV typically higher than calls, such as Put IDV at 0.08748 and Call IDV 0.07048 on Friday, April 9 - but this is often seen in tech stocks and is usually explained by heavy hedging of long positions.

In the last two weeks, both calls and puts were moving down to the 0.05 level of IDV, largely at parity.

Today, a little after 1:09 ET (I ran the model a number of times because I was having trouble pulling in live data) I recorded the 140 Put IDV at 0.06025 (GME at 141.27) and the 145 Call IDV at 0.03856 (GME was 141.22). [Yeah, I know, that is not the same strike but when they are that close you still get very close to parity].

Other than in panics, I don't recall that I have ever seen a parity spread that wide. 

To me it indicates an extreme level of hedging. Any other guesses?

[Edit: ran the models again at 1:18:04 and the spread persists, but at a lower level, the 145 Put at 0.05699 and the 150 Call 0.03062. Another thing that surprises me is that the Call IDV is so low .. part of that explains the parity spread].

[Update edit at 12:30 PDT]:

And by 3:20 PM ET it was entirely arbitraged away! At 12:23:19 the May 21 145 Put has an IDV of 0.05680 and at 12:22:19 the 150 Call had an IDV of 0.05539 (and that is essentially parity). I pulled up the limit order book for the 150 Put and watched with fascination how that one participated in the convergence. A while ago when that Put had an ask size of 116 at 11.60 it had a bid size of 1 at 10.80, but hundreds of contracts bid at 10:50. It sat there for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the solitary 10.80 (it was on PEARL) got filled and then 10.50 ask at high volume instantly became best ask. I have been watching this kind of screwy trading all day long in GME near the money options. Very interesting and kind of unusual. We are back to parity so someone made a little money here I guess on rational arbitrage.

OK, time to move on.

There was some asymmetry - put IDV typically higher than calls, such as Put IDV at 0.08748 and Call IDV 0.07048 on Friday, April 9 - but this is often seen in tech stocks and is usually explained by heavy hedging of long positions.

In the last two weeks, both calls and puts were moving down to the 0.05 level of IDV, largely at parity.

Today, a little after 1:09 ET (I ran the model a number of times because I was having trouble pulling in live data) I recorded the 140 Put IDV at 0.06025 (GME at 141.27) and the 145 Call IDV at 0.03856 (GME was 141.22). [Yeah, I know, that is not the same strike but when they are that close you still get very close to parity].

Other than in panics, I don't recall that I have ever seen a parity spread that wide. 

To me it indicates an extreme level of hedging. Any other guesses?

[Edit: ran the models again at 1:18:04 and the spread persists, but at a lower level, the 145 Put at 0.05699 and the 150 Call 0.03062. Another thing that surprises me is that the Call IDV is so low .. part of that explains the parity spread].

[Update edit at 12:30 PDT]:

And by 3:20 PM ET it was entirely arbitraged away! At 12:23:19 the May 21 145 Put has an IDV of 0.05680 and at 12:22:19 the 150 Call had an IDV of 0.05539 (and that is essentially parity). I pulled up the limit order book for the 150 Put and watched with fascination how that one participated in the convergence. A while ago when that Put had an ask size of 116 at 11.60 it had a bid size of 1 at 10.80, but hundreds of contracts bid at 10:50. It sat there for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the solitary 10.80 (it was on PEARL) got filled and then 10.50 ask at high volume instantly became best ask. I have been watching this kind of screwy trading all day long in GME near the money options. Very interesting and kind of unusual. We are back to parity so someone made a little money here I guess on rational arbitrage.

OK, time to move on. 

And for those of you asking what it all means, it means that options are really, really interesting.",2021-05-11,773,290

I myself am long in GME because Ryan Cohen is BRILLIANT and the company will be great in the future under proper leadership. As for the squeeze, I would not mind it but could care less atm. Should it occur, I will buy covered calls (buy-write for those who do not understand) and enjoy it.

With the proxy vote arriving, does anyone see it being the catalyst for the squeeze to finally occur and be ended? We can all agree that absuive shorts attempted to bankrupt GameStop and should not have the power to do so. My thoughts are, with the amount of calls being ""thrown to the wind"" like these, is there something we do not know or cannot see? Why would someone aimlessly throw away $1.6m? They wouldn't. I have the luxury of doing well for myself and would not waste money on a guarentee fail. So, if you have any thoughts that aren't too tin-foilish, lmk.

Cheers and good luck to everyone. Bears, Bulls, Pigs, and even gamblers.

This is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):

&#x200B;

>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  
>  
>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\[1\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \[2\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \[3\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don’t you start.  
>  
>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  
>  
>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  
>  
>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I’ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  
>  
>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  
>  
>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \[those\] relationships.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>My time is coming done. *How are you going to solve this? Do you feel that we can so we don't have any more of this Gamestop?*

Hello apes, have not posted a technical analysis in a while. Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.

\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$

\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!

\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.

\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.

\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.

Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.

TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",2021-04-23,5600,1189
mvldoj_GME,GME,"GME/AMC SQUEEZE, when to cash in?","GME/AMC SQUEEZE, when to cash in.

When do you actually cash in your shares during the big POP to get the maximum return? That answer depends on how many shares you own.

GOOD ADVICE: don't sell on the way up, sell just after the peak.
The problem is, we have no idea what the actual real peak will be. 

There will be fake outs, over and over again, think of it as steps, but you don't know how many steps there are. We also don't know how many days or weeks this will take to unwind.

If you only own a few shares, your best bet is to wait for a high number you like and go for it. Possibly leaving 1 share to see how high it goes.

If you own a large number of shares your better off spacing out your cash in point over different price points. That way your chances of getting a good price is much higher.  Leave a few shares in just to see what happens.

THE BIG UNKNOWNS:
1) how long the process will last, days, week's?
2) how high the price will go.

Just to restate, this won't be resolved in a single day. Expect a long drawn out crap show.",2021-04-21,12,44

mnwx0g_GME,GME,"An untrained perspective of GME (There was no ""Tin Foil Hat"" flair or i would have used it)","Yup, i said it. That's me. When will the squeeze happen? Here's how i see it.

There are lots of DD and guesses going by. Every day passes another guess that didn't come to fruition. Let's face it. No one really knows. Heck, the super successful wallstreet guys never really know either. They always just find the latest loophole/advantage and exploit it, until everything catches up... 

So that leaves me with my dark place, protected by my foil hat. I cant do DD. I dont have years of time put in, or inside knowledge. I'm just a guy who wanted to play.

6 billion in losses isnt shit to these types. They also have ""Friends"" with 90 billion each. 100's of them. They can call 6 roaches out of the woodwork and squash a few million small traders, no problem. So WTF is going on?

Melvin and Co. Got caught in the shitter when the bell rang, by a bunch of apes. Normally, a quick cover up. Some fuckery. A quick illegal shutdown. Some distraction from the new SEC chair, who gives hannies to melvins friends at the parties, some ""Press"" (lmao) and business as usual.... But.

Some huge voices made some statements of support. Like ""nothing to see here. Just normal predatory behavior."" Coupled with the new ability for the masses to transfer information still somewhat unfettered by Beef Wellington and his friends in Connecticut. (Slowly being lost now)

This ""exposed"" the fuckery. Informed the apes who were joined by some heavy hitters, who pinned the petty tyrants into a corner. Where they remain now.

Here is my hat.
I was staring and waiting while this odd stagnation plays out. I went to the most basic levels of thought. I droned on the bid and ask size, which was sitting at ""1"" for extended periods. Really? On $GME? The biggest, most monumental shockwave to smack face on ass face?

Then i saw it. For every action, a reaction. (Regarding the bid/ask sizes) so i tightened my hat. Surely Melvin and kenny and friends are up to fuckery. They will do it with methods and tools not available to apes. The shit will be covered by the corrupt friends in high places. Apes ""would"" get shit on. Using HF Trading systems and sketchy practices to get out of a jam. Little guy gets the shaft again. Right in front of your lying eyes!

  BUT, there are now predators on the side of the apes. The exposure of the vulnerability caught the attention of Beef Wellington's rivals (Beef always shat on them at the party. A little TOO arrogant for the club) who see the opportunity to take Beef's pie and leave with it.  *and an equal force of methods and tools* are now working against the shorted position. Algorithms set that ""counter"" every move made. Experienced traders try to look at the analytics of a day and say WTF here? Every day... don't worry. THEY know WTF

Uh oh... there is no way out now. Everybody knows it. Who ends up with the pie in the end, is the game...

So, ""when""? There is no set time. Beef will have to start shitting on people OTHER than the little guy now. Small fries will start falling. Bigger and bigger entities. ""Names"" will start to fall. Soon, Beef will shit on the wrong guy, who holds the cards to the explosion and final, inevidable downfall.
THEN, you will see large scale implosions. It will be there for all to see. Can't hide it. Can't fuckery out of it. In the news everyday. Another ""massive"" (not really that massive in the realm) corporation or company or entity goes down. Boom!

This process will be longer too. You won't have to catch a 2 NanoSecond peak on thursday. Just keep a good supply of popcorn, and enjoy.

So in conclusion, that's how i stand and hold with none of the FUD having affect. It WILL happen. I DON'T have to watch for anything. The whole world will be watching.

I'll have my little piece though. Because i won't give it back.

Peace out!",2021-04-10,16,72

mbfm99_GE,GE,"Sir Isaac Newton secretly wrote about GME, and was a 💎🙌 💪🦍 who gave us a target share price","Isaac Newton is known as being one of the biggest smart smarts in history. 

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

𝕹𝖊𝖜𝖙𝖔𝖓'𝖘 𝕷𝖆𝖜 𝖔𝖋 𝖀𝖓𝖎𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖘𝖆𝖑 𝕲𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓 (𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓐𝓹𝓮 𝓛𝓪𝔀)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s² and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>gₑ = (6.67 \* 10⁻¹¹ N•m²/kg²)(6.0\*10²⁴ kg(/(6.4\*10⁶m)²  
>  
>gₑ = 9.8 m/s²

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually 𝕭𝖎𝖌 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇𝖘 who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GMₑ= gₑ \* Rₑ²

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""ₑ's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE²

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29²  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us.

mbqxm9_MS,MS,GME: 4 Additional Board Members Expected to leave in June. Possible additional changes to senior executives.,"[Buried in the 10-K that Gamestop released today, under ITEM 9B Other Information](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109) are additional upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:



>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**


*This indicates four more board members than previously announced are planning on leaving. Additionally, a little further down there is a caveat under the description of the formation of the Strategic Committee that indicates additional senior executive changes may be in the cards:*


>Our Board of Directors has formed a committee of directors called the “Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee” (the Strategic Committee). The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our operational objectives and corporate strategy, capital allocation priorities and other opportunities for maximizing stockholder value. Our Board, through the Strategic Committee, is currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm to assist it in its evaluation and exploration. **This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of our senior executives.**





*******
`````Updated since some incorrectly believe this is old news`````

Here is the [original section of the 8K filed for the agreement with RC Ventures Jan 11](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) that shows the four additional names listed as leaving today were at that time expected to stand for re-election:


>Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to increase the size of its board of directors (the “Board”) by three directors to a total of 13 directors and appoint Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube (the “New Directors”) as members of the Board, each with a term expiring at the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”). The Company has further agreed that, effective at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced by four directors to a total of nine directors. The Board will nominate each of the New Directors (or their replacements appointed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) and **current directors Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aimé, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner and Kurt Wolf for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting.**

********
Edit 2:
Just spotted another minor change from the same section of the 10-K:

The previous CFO is out as of tomorrow, not the 26th, with the previously mentioned interim CFO picking up his duties until a replacement is announced. Not really new info, just moved the timeframe up 2 days. I wonder if this means there will be a new CFO announcement sooner because his end date moved up, or if it means they are still searching and the interim will be in place for a while.

>Mr. Bell’s cessation as our Chief Financial Officer and Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh’s assumption of the role of interim Chief Financial Officer will occur on March 24, 2021

********
Edit 3:
One last edit because I'm seeing a lot of articles coming out in the media where they lean heavily on the fact that Gamestop retains the ability to issue shares:

From [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under 

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**


Yes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.",2021-03-23,4013,222

$GME -25% 3/19 EOW

# Rambling OPINION PIECE, skip if you just want the calculator

It's been two weeks with over 70% correlation between gamma and price. Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for 🦍🦍🦍 to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.

Some important points

1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.
2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.
3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.
4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\_was\_the\_footprint\_of\_institutional\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)
5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.
6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate

I believe if 🦍🦍🦍 understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   🍌 to it, 🦍🦍🦍 together  💪 , 🦍🦍🦍 + 🧠 = mega  🍌🍌 🍌

# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8

This update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders

The calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include

* Current Price
* Projected Price
* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)
* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)
* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date

The new graph simulator graph has the following controls

https://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e

That allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a

From the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while 🌈🐻 buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.

By clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price

https://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571

From the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.

To find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge

https://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a

To find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest

https://preview.redd.it/yb8j1jdu8ho61.jpg?width=1315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6495f3c8ea70a1a543a62a3d03bcda5cd75b3d8

You can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).

To model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.

https://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448

change the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067

https://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4

You'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.

On the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.

https://preview.redd.it/r74sn5ud9ho61.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae17addc9f5cf1d9c1dac73343fbb2847524f00

Gamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV

&#x200B;

# Obligatory harebrained scheme

If all 🦍🦍🦍 understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.

*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling 🦍🦍🦍 to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if 🦍 did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*

For this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  💎🤲 , I suggest 🦍🦍🦍 wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, 🦍🦍🦍 can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.

Summarizing, the steps are

1. 💎🤲  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week
2. Wait for IV <200%
3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio
4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting 🍌🍌🍌s. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *🦍🦍🦍* together or the play won't work
5. Watch price goes up end of week
6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain
7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes
8. Witness short hedgies cry
9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse
10. Profit !!!

With the current structure of the OI strikes, expiries and underlying price, $GME will be bleeding shares, dumped by MM because delta is decreasing due to theta. This phenomenon is particular in high IV stocks with a concentration of OI strikes above the underlying nearing expiry, ie like $GME.

To get back to Monday's price level, you guys need to either NET BUY 400MM USD(400 thousand **🦍🦍🦍** with 1k 🍌🍌🍌 each)  worth of shares (not on RH since they may not be actually buying it but just give you an IOU instead), or Gamma up the ATM and near OTM options for 3/19 and 3/26. No, I'm not a HF shill or  a thetagang vampire, I'm being real, your stimmy won't be enough to move the market  by only  buying shares at this price point.

Ms Alexis Goldstein agrees that options probably contributed most of the volatility

m7vpcc_EA,EA,"Healthy Discussion About Potential Risk of GameStop, Please Support This Thread"," 

Hi Mods and Apes,

I want to create a thread where we can have a healthy discussion of the potential risk of GME. WallstreetBets is turning itself as GMEBet nothing else. GME is not that relevant anymore in my opinion. Anything raising doubts or discussing potential downside will be downvote to dead. Whenever I reply to a comment will get the downvote attack as well. or fill with trash comments like apes can't read etc. It's toxic and unhealthy. The posts that I put up got taken down in 5 seconds due to not enough popularity. How? Is that manipulation? or we need better training for the new mods?

I'm betting against GME with leap options as I disclosed before. So at this level, I think GME is dangerous and have more downside than upside looking at every single metric.

Here is what I'm thinking:

* Next week post earning. GME is likely to announce a huge secondary offering to pay down debt and raise capital. This makes perfect sense given the amount of buyback they did in the past. This is a once-a-lifetime opportunity for GME which is great.
* There is no easy way to turn this company around. I don't say this easily, but EA has Origin, Activision has Battle Net, Ubisoft has its own, and Steam. How many of you are buying games majority from retail these days? I'm talking about the mainstream. Looking at those companies earning. There is no sign this will be changing anytime soon.
* I don't know the short squeeze gamma squeeze still holds, you can claim all data are fake, then I'm not sure why people are still living or trading in this country. Even the stock price is fake, it doesn't matter if it has a short squeeze or not. The big boys can just change the price like a video game. If you are on fake news and fake data camp. Please move on.
* Many big tech and great companies are getting hammered. Either people are selling to meet their margin requirement or reserving cash to buy the dip later, GME is not comparable to many of the good deals out there.
* SEC may be stepping in at any time for some actions, good or bad will impact the stock price. It's clear to me that there were many hedge funds were involved in driving up the stock price (P&D), there are still a ton of bag holders at the 300 and 400 levels if you disagree. So someone will definitely get caught for some illegal behavior at some point. There are 2 different kinds of hedge funds just so you know, the short that got burned, and the speculating ones that gain a ton off retail apes.

TL:DR

We're here at WSB is to try to make money and beat the market. So even GME was good at one point is no longer good at this level. If you disagree, but please be civil and nice. Bring up your points rather than trashing talks and attacks.",2021-03-18,0,11

m6hj9a_HON,HON,Gme isn't over,"Hello retards,

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a 🥖French🥐 retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other. In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng 🧻🙌). It also trigger stop loss (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE?

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data 🖍️ to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions.

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our 🌈🐻.

* ***🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸***

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people 💖) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge 🚀 tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win !

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose !

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet : “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.”

TLDR: Price down cause of short sells and 🧻🙌 ----> Solution = Buy now and hold 💎🙌 for going to 🚀🌑

I like the stock (16.56@216)

m4rbdw_MS,MS,Forbes just published the DUMBEST and most dangerous article yet about the GME saga.,"Here's the link: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2021/03/09/losing-touch-with-reality--a-gamestop-lesson)

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

Here's the tweet they sent out: [Forbes on Twitter: ""Losing Touch With Reality – A GameStop Lesson https://t.co/msQlQleVqI"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1370993131592814601)

LLY,"LLY is the maker of PROZAC and if you are anything like me you feel like you need some after not buying GME at $5 .. Should you buy GME after it rose 50x ? I'm kinda scared to do that even though I'm a retard. And I hope I'm wrong and GME rises another 50x for all the APES that are in YOLO positions.

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) .. This will help both those stocks if you feel like they are a good alternate investment. Time to cheer up the old fashioned way :)

There is a lot of speculation that GME will go crazy high (like $1000+). Of course that very well may not happen, however if it did get up to say $1000, would it be better to exercise the contracts because they would be so far in the money at that point?

m0eeav_PATH,PATH,"🦍 🦍 🦍 optimize your stimmy 🍌🍌🍌, $GME gamma squeeze calculator update","The purpose of these posts is to provide tools that enable 🦍 🦍 🦍 to calculate the gamma squeeze effect for themselves.

I've updated the gamma squeeze calculator to include all the option chains until 2023 and removed the 3/5 expired ones, it now contains a total of 2,603 strikes and expiries. I have also added several new parameters to address shortcomings that others had pointed out. If for example you wish to only include strikes that will expire ITM in that week, now you can do it via the filters.

The calculator can be used to simulate several projected delta hedging scenarios under different forecasted prices with the time value as a parameter

https://preview.redd.it/ftfr19bmnsl61.jpg?width=421&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ee056d4fbcd4c95690d429d53c780f719511d29

We see from the cover that even using very conservative parameters, MMs are holding close to 20% of the float just to delta hedge, which might partly explain the high float percentage owned by institutions as displayed on Bloomberg's terminal.

Now 🦍 🦍 🦍 only have limited amount of 🍌🍌🍌, 🦍 🦍 🦍 need to ensure each 🍌 is used for maximum effect. Based on the calculator's BSM modeling, the best delta/price ratio in the options chain across all expiries would be

https://preview.redd.it/7f1mifkqnsl61.jpg?width=1514&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b071e11c59970d61a5b84efe8e4cde2a28c3c1

The 3/12 270C, if apes were to buy one contract, 3.04 x 100 = $304, then MMs would need to hedge 0.137x100x137.74 = $1882 worth of shares to remain delta neutral

Giving an amplification factor of

**1 🍌 -> 6 🍌**

OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO-ers 🦍 , but carry very high risk of 🦍 loosing all 🍌, if 3/12 closing price ends below 270. A safer way for 🦍, would probably be ITM calls, somewhere around the 100-110C strike price

https://preview.redd.it/nsheej6tnsl61.jpg?width=1517&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ebb4ab3f305e9d3e940c030ca1229592e2fce75

This would still gives 1 🍌 -> 3 🍌 in delta hedge amplification

The profit / loss for 🦍🦍🦍 would be

Suppose $GME on 3/12 does close above 151, what should 🦍 do next ? Best would be to exercise those calls, but most 🦍🦍🦍 are poor(because they are 🦍🦍🦍) and don't have enough powder to exercise calls. The next best thing would be to rollover those calls, selling 🦍's calls that are expiring and buying the next week's ITM calls at higher strike, further propagating the gamma squeeze. Here's a graphical illustration of the process

https://preview.redd.it/4tvci7b7osl61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16ac2e20103057ca7421be70b341850cef7bc34d

this way, 🦍 ape can ensure 🍌 is used to maximum effect, without taking on too much risk while also mitigating the shorts attacks.

🦍🦍🦍 path to victory is almost ensured, but 🦍 should be aware that  🦍 is not in the final stage yet, 🦍 still needs to go through MMs first before showdown with 🐊👑 in WallStreet. MMs are cold blooded amphibian species that likes to dwell in polluted bodies of water, thus most can be found alongside the Chicago river in Wacker drive. The following map shows path to infinite 🍌🍌🍌

# TL;DR 🦍🦍🦍 🤲 💪, 🦍🦍🦍 🤲 + 📊 = 👨‍🚀🚀🌕💰🏦

**Edit 1 :**

**The 3/8 closing price of 194.5 should've triggered an additional 3 million stocks of delta covering, bringing the total stocks bought by MM for delta hedging to 13.5 million(25% of float)**

**Edit 2:**

**Buying the strike/expiry mentioned in this DD at open today would've netted you EOD**

**3/12 270C +340%**

**3/12 110C +157%**

lyu9n0_PATH,PATH,Options Greeks and why GME far OTM calls are counter productive,"I got asked to write this post to explain my opinion on GME's option trading and why I think buying far OTM (C800) etc. is actually bad for everyone trying to watch the price rise.

Before we get into any real discussion standard legal shit:

* I'm not a financial advisor
* I'm not a pro
* This is my opinion and not advice

My position:

I'm basically completely bled dry so I only hold one 3/19 C300 and yes I know it's a long shot but I'm deep into other positions. I got the call because I begrudgingly love this sub and the autists that frequent it.

Okay, so people want to buy FD's and get paid but it's important to understand what you're actually doing when you buy that option and pay that premium.

I am hoping that I won't be downvoted to oblivion because I'm actually trying to help people understand as much as I can and be more successful. I'm not an expert so this is my best understanding of how options work.

&#x200B;

Let's talk about options...

## Strike Price

A strike price is the set price at which a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it is [exercised](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp). For [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder; for [put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp), the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)

the strike price is what everyone screams about and it's the magic numbers we want to watch the price go to in order to ensure our options are In The Money (ITM) If options are ITM that means that your option has value, even if it doesn't go past the point where you hit a break even ( which ideally you want to see to realize a profit) All option contracts that are ITM are subject to potential exercise and this is where the magic happens.

Options that expire OTM are worthless. All those 3/5 C800, yes all 30,000 of them that expired? Free money to the people that sold them to you? Why did you give free money to the people that are going to spend it to try to stop you from making more money? Well probably because you didn't understand what you were doing.

&#x200B;

# Premium

This is the money you paid to the option seller. The hedge fund, the market maker, the theta Chad trying to fuck your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend. You need to keep in mind that this money goes directly into their pocket and they don't just put it away for a rainy day. They may do shit with that money to increase their chances of being correct and your chance of being out of the money (OTM)

&#x200B;

## Delta

Delta is the ratio that compares the change in the price of an asset, usually [marketable securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketable_security.asp), to the corresponding change in the price of its [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp). For example, if a stock option has a delta value of 0.65, this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share, the option on it will rise by $0.65 per share, all else being equal.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp)

At-The-Money options typically have Deltas hanging around .5 ($.50 per $1 of underlying price movement) where as far OTM calls have extremely low Delta because they're still extremely unlikely to expire ITM. Options that are ITM already have Delta's around 1($1 for every $1 of underlying price movement) because every gain is seen as a profit because you're already past the point of probability.

&#x200B;

## Gamma

Gamma is the rate of change in an option's [delta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) per 1-point move in the underlying asset's price. Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a [derivative's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) value, in relation to the underlying. A [delta hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp) strategy seeks to reduce gamma in order to maintain a hedge over a wider price range. A consequence of reducing gamma, however, is that [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) will also be reduced.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp)

&#x200B;

Gamma incorporates time. Gamma will be low and look much like a bell curve with respect to time. When time decreases the price of the option is extremely sensitive to time because you have less time to see your option change in value. ITM options become increasingly more likely to expire ITM and OTM options become increasingly less valuable because it would take a fucking miracle to make them ITM.

&#x200B;

# Let's talk about orders and price movement a little

What makes selling an option safe? What makes it risky? Ask yourself a simple question. if you want to be successful are you move likely to sell an OTM call at C50 or C500. Obviously you're more likely to not get assigned your call exercise if your strike price is higher. How can you understand the risk?

A few key concepts

&#x200B;

# Volume

Knowing how much buying and selling happens on a regular basis can inform your intuition as to how much volatility you might expect. If you see a stock with a volume of 1M you might assume from that the chance of volume of 100M is very low.

&#x200B;

# Holding

Holding your shares of your stock does a few things when we consider basic economics

* It lowers the supply of the desired underlying.
* It may not have any effect at all on the demand
* Smart people will look at a 'cult' of people holding and understand that this is a 'control' or a constant rather than a variable on which they can incorporate to make decisions. If you know people won't sell suddenly and that if you can presume that they have no more buying your a portion of your risk is mitigated by the simple fact that you are concluding a buying frenzy is unlikely to occur => making sold calls safer.

Consider the bloodbath of the past few weeks. Stocks are tumbling but GME... it's basically stayed very consistent. Some stocks are down 20/30 percent, but GME is basically flat. How? people aren't selling and they also aren't buying that much.

&#x200B;

# Open Interest

Open interest is sometimes confused with trading [volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp), but the two terms refer to [different measures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-open-interest-and-volume.asp). On a day when one trader who already holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to a new trader entering the market, the transfer of contracts does not create any change in the open interest figure for that particular option.

No new option contracts have been added to the market because one trader is transferring their position to another. However, the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer does increase the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp)

# What strikes are people buying calls for? (expiry 3/5)

&#x200B;

|Strike|Open Interest|In the money?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|30|63|Yes|
|40|598|Yes|
|45|4612|Yes|
|50|1597|Yes|
|135|\~5500|Yes|
|140|\>14,000|No|
|250|4854|No|
|300|5446|No|
|800|\~30,000|No|

All the ITM calls retained value and can be sold or exercised. all OTM calls are worth NOTHING.

&#x200B;

Is there any surprise that it ended up this way? Ending the week above $140 would have caused option sellers to either buy back or get assigned for 14,000 \*100 =1,400,000 shares

&#x200B;

# If you were an option seller, and you were smart enough to buy GME at $50 and you sold covered calls or naked calls at $140 and you saw it at $140 what would you do?

* Sell your shares to lower the price
* Consider shorting it to lower the price
* Buy the underlying to hedge against the oncoming ass fucking (this is a gamma sqz)
* Literally anything but give retards on wsb 1.4Million GME shares worth of money.

# Here's a list of the things you would NOT do

* Stop selling super deep OTM (C800) calls
* Stand by and watch and risk losing your 5th yacht while working class assholes take your money

&#x200B;

Jail is for poor people, never forget that. It's not for rich people.

&#x200B;

Let's look at what some folks are buying these days

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0kcgnkle5cl61.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=346f279562a639f270f3aace65f050af4066a58d

[Do you guys see what the problem is yet?](https://preview.redd.it/jzu7qymu3cl61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1407dcfa5492f20d740b073dad7c9c91f0f702e6)

People are spending their money buying these retarded calls that have no chance of success.

&#x200B;

Remember when I said earlier that if you sell a call and you have money it's in your best interest to use that money to increase your chance of success?

It makes sense to spend as much much as you need to to mitigate risks. If you winning cost them $100,000,000 and it will only cost them $99,999,999.99 to make sure you don't expire ITM, guess what...

THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT THING.

This is the basic economics of opportunity cost. For you retards that didn't take economics or don't read it means the valuable path is derived by comparing it to all other paths.

&#x200B;

Obviously they're not spending all of their premium to make sure options expire ITM, if they were it'd be a bad trade to begin with. These folks are smart, they know math, understand probability and have a deep understand of options arbitrage, orders, limits etc.

&#x200B;

# So what am I saying?

# TLDR

Buying super far OTM calls is fucking retarded. You're just handing the people you're trying to beat free money. It's harder to win when you keep giving all the advantages to the people you're trying to take money from Yes of course they could become the biggest gainers but they are the last calls that will become profitable. So say we had a gamma sqz to 790 and you hold until near expiration. Guess what? Theta(option price decay over time) murdered all your money because you wanted to spend all your cash on the absolutely least likely successful call.

Buying ATM/ or close OTM (Next Strike) has a very real possibility of actually making you money. Those options might actually cause a price increase.

If people who bought calls were stacked ATM near the current market price this could very easily start a gamma squeeze. Every seller doesn't want to get fucked so every single one of them is going to try to cover their own ass.

Like if the options were something like

* 135 - 15,000
* 140 - 12,000
* 145 - 20,000
* 150 - 15,000

# SUDDENLY

All of the call sellers become potential panic-buyers afraid of losing their Manhattan condo.

Do you see the difference? Every time a strike is hit the next strike becomes almost destined to be hit. The amount of shares needed to cover those sold calls forces the price up if they're exercised and it's a mathimagical chain reaction. The important thing to look at is what is the volume of limit sells between the strike prices? if there isn't enough shares between strike prices that are within that price range it $135 going ITM makes not only $140 to go ITM but now suddenly $145 may become ITM and we haven't even dealt with $140 yet. Do you get it now?

Don't come at with that bullshit like I'm a shill or bot either check my history I was posting DD pre-GME craze.

If you think I'm wrong => cool. But don't downvote me because I'm trying to help you. I wish all of you the best and I hope GME goes to $1,000 and Biden legally classifies DFV as the first living deity in human history.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes I'm fully aware that you can buy far OTM calls and sell them later before expiration and realize gains if the  price goes up. Day trading option traders are not the target audience of this piece so fuck off kindly.

If you liked my post you can check profile for other shit I've written and also proof I was in on GME

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Not specifically advocating for it but 3/19 is the 'quad witching' day and that typically sees crazy option levels as I understand.

&#x200B;

EDIT3 on 3/8: Yeah so If you heard me out and bought a C150 or C160 You'd basically be ITM literally right now as of 3/8 before lunch. Have fun all.",2021-03-06,4617,662

Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

&#x200B;

This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.

Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.

If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.

You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.

If you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.

Edit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......

Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,

&#x200B;

>Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group

lw0g1g_PATH,PATH,The industry players again GME,"Thought I would have a quick run through of the mid February 13F's to see who has the big positions against GME. Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.

>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

&#x200B;

This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.

Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.

If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.

You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.

If you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.

Edit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......

Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,

I’ve been super stoked about Mama Kelli’s start, I think we can start expecting some substantial moves in GameStop’s org structure with Mama Kelli at the helm. Every customer is gonna feel so serviced even boomer Sherman can get a chub.

lugobr_TM,TM,Wondering where to set your sell limit for GME? Worried about missing the squeeze? Please read.,"First off, welcome to Wendys! Where our advice isn’t financial, and our burgers are stuffed with crayons!

I’ve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren’t sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you’ve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.

I’ve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn’t Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 2nd: $263

October 3rd: $277

October 6th: $292

October 7th: $287

October 8th: $294

October 9th: $296

October 10th: $342

October 13th: $353

October 14th: $352

October 15th: $390

October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**

October 17th: $358

October 20th: $277

October 21st: $242

October 22nd: $243

October 23rd: $229

October 24th: $210

October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn’t* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn’t matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

luc6hf_PATH,PATH,GME IS A MEME STOCK,"I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

**Has the Squeeze Been Sqoze? Absolutely not**

**Will the squeeze be sqoze? Potentially** 

**Strap in. This is going to be exhaustively long, but I have a lot to say.**

**Please** see my other work. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not a shill, I am not here for confirmation bias, I am a pragmatic, neutral party. Anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper DD on **me.** If you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate I have been thus far. Even in Part 5 I nearly perfectly predicted all of Friday's entire movements. 

**Note:** That does not mean I will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga. I also am not saying all of this to flex, it's because I am tired of being called a shill when I was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate. This doesn't mean you should take what I am saying as truth, but it does mean that if it doesn't align with your thoughts you should probably put down the kool-aid, loosen up the tin-foil hat, and listen to someone else's opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact, this isn't even advice. It is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been. One thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes. If people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in, please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say. 

**I also want to make it crystal clear that I think the squeeze has not been sqoze, however, the landscape is very different now.**

Finally, any PT’s including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict. Please do not take these as certain numbers. It’s the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens Monday.

# So What Happened Friday?

For the sake of this not being an entire novel, I encourage you to read Part 5 as I think that prediction is precisely what happened. To summarize, we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point, volume wasn't enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through, that's when selling and more shorting occurred. The price dipped down to around 88. Now, I didn't mention this in the DD but I did mention it in the comments section that I expect interesting price action around 2pm. Why? Because of the call options expiring ITM. 

I think these shares were already covered. I know we expect a higher price increase, but why? Where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions? 

Total Options That Expired On 02/26 ITM: **22,713** [Data from here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows)

This would equate to **2,271,300** shares 

At **13:02** the price fell to **\~86,** this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day. By **13:07** there was a volume of over **20,000,000** in the buying direction. 

Not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered. 

At **13:07** alone there was a positive net change in volume of **17,656,000** nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered...within 1 minute. 

The rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to **\~121**. Then it began falling off again, as did volume. 

Now, ask yourself...why would this be the case? Because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing, this was the ITM calls being covered. 

*At this point I'm sure you're ready to stop reading and call me a shill, but I encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next. This may not fit your narrative, and that's ok. A squeeze is possible, it might just be time to think that it won't be happening quite the way you imagined.*

# Before we move on to what comes next, let's play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding. 

For some reason, people still believe that holding your shares is preventing HF's from covering. I cannot express how untrue this sentiment is. Holding is a valid play, but it absolutely **should not** be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts. A 5 second look at any chart could show you there is **more than enough** sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them.

Let's take the largest post on r/gme as an example.

The top post of all time received **59,600** upvotes. According to the comments most people are actually holding only about 1-10 shares each. But for the sake of the argument let's get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns **100** shares of GME. Let's also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys.

That's a total of **5,960,000** shares that are being tucked away so HF's can't get their grubby little paws on them. On Friday alone, **91,960,000** shares were exchanged. So even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from. 

Holding is certainly a valid play, but there are two things holding certainly does not do:

1. It does not increase the price of a stock
2. It does not prevent HF's from covering

If you are holding solely because of these two reasons, then you are playing this wrong. There are three reasons to actually hold:

1. You absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent, so you are patiently waiting for it to occur.
2. You are already positioned extremely well like DFV who has a cost basis of 26.7896
3. You are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake, you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable. 

**If you don't believe me, then please examine the evidence.**

When you purchase a stock the price goes up, when you sell a stock the price goes down. So what happened when RH restricted trading? The price plummeted. Why? Because holding and selling were the only options.

Let's play another absurd game and pretend that 100% of shareholders held when trading was restricted. The price would have gone completely sideways, it would not have gone up or down.

But let's be realistic, that will never happen. Even if retail traders decided to hold, institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up. No, no. They are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense. You call them allies which they are not, they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100% gains while everyone else is waiting for 10,000% gains.

I want to pause for a moment in this DD and take a moment to point something out. Even though I'm not trying to convince anyone to sell, I have been called all sorts of names as though I'm evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation. But let's be absolutely clear. **You are the ones peer pressuring people into holding. You are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative. You are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope.** 

If you have made it this far, congratulations, I would love to have a discussion regarding the ""hold"" play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above. 

# My Thesis

My thesis remains the same, **the shorts want a short squeeze.** Yes, this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this. They need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round. They are reporting their losses publicly...but they have not disclosed their gains. 

I think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze. They open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers FOMO and market purchasing as well. This allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene. 

Once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak, they begin shorting on the way down, opening new, extremely favorable positions. The gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable ones...by a lot. 

Institutional traders are not stupid, they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze. They ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls. As I mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100% gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the Earth. 

So institutions ride it up, sell at the top, where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down. They then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again. Rinse and repeat.

I think the idea of the [Interstellar Yo-Yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/) was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component, ""Snidely"" in the story is *intentionally* doing this. 

A circumstance like GME will never happen again, when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that don't allow these kinds of things to happen. Institutions and HF's would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can.

So my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground. 

**Let's think about that for a moment.**

If your original PT on GME was $1000, you are already almost there.

The first squeeze took the price from \~$12 to \~$500, \~$488 increase.

The second squeeze took the price from \~$40 to $200, \~$160 increase.

So, already GME has increased around $648. You are now only a $352 increase away from your $1000 PT.

**Is a massive short squeeze still possible?**

**Yes.** However, so much of the DD floating around is all talking about *possibility* but we as investors don't care about that. We care about *probability.* 

So what is the probability of a massive short squeeze? Well, there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as Cohen joining the board. I think there are still several catalysts which I outline in [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). There could very well be new catalysts that I have not mentioned since that post, such as Cohen getting appointed CEO as I have learned many believe based on his Tweet. 

Let's talk numbers.

There are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible. 

$170 - This is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce, but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number.

$200 - This is a MASSIVE sell wall. Why? Well, I think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned. Probably not right at $200, they probably shorted \~$205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall.

If this sell wall falls, it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze *however* it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the $200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period. 

If this happens, it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over $400. At this point, FOMO + shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over $1000.

**But what is the** ***probability*** **that this will happen?**

Without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume.

Let's consider the first squeeze and volume for reference.

**Jan 22nd:** This was the highest volume at **197,157,900,** the high was 76.76 and the low was 42.32

Absolutely insane volume, but it didn't move the price all that much (I mean at least in comparison to other days)

**Jan 25th:** Volume **177,874,000 H:**159.18 **L:** 61.13

**Jan 26th:** Volume **178,588,000 H:**150.00 **L:** 80.20

**Jan 27th:** Volume **93,396,700 H:** 380.00 **L:** 249.00

**Jan 28th:** Volume **58,815,800 H:** 483.00 **L:** 112.25

**Jan 29th:** Volume **50,259,200 H:** 413.98 **L:** 250.00  


See the pattern?

**25th:** 177M volume to nearly triple the price (160%)

**26th:** Even more volume to only double the price (87%)

**27th:**  Half the volume for a 52% increase 

The volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasing/decreasing, with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted. These first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze. 

The 28th and beyond trading was restricted, but if everyone could only sell or hold, why wouldn't the price immediately fall? How could there still be support? This was shorts covering. Between just those two days there was \~109,000,000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell. A *perfect* time for shorts to cover. 

**But I thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up?** 

Absolutely...if trading wasn't restricted. Because virtually everyone could only sell, this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction FUD. 

So, as strange as it seems, I think the price going up was *some* shorts covering but for the most part, I think they covered while the price was falling. I know this *seems* counter-intuitive, but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered, the amount of selling was able to drive the price down *while* they covered. Again, think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted, *someone* was buying massive amounts of shares as the price fell...and it wasn't us.

**So, Hooman, if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible?**

Because of my thesis, entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions. Perhaps some of the old HF's also did to try to recoup some losses. Last week we *almost* forced this to happen all over again, but a TON of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at $200 prevented us from tipping that very important, very first domino. This isn't the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down, this is a different situation entirely. 

That situation is *still* squeezable. The question is...how?

Volume. Volume. Volume.   
Sheer and pure buying power.

We would *need* those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that $200 sell wall AND hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close. We were so damn close but couldn't quite break it. This is precisely why my predictions for Friday were so accurate.

A catalyst, a whale, large global sentiment again, FOMO; there are A LOT of different ways this is *possible,* but as I mentioned before; we as investors deal with *probable.*

In one of my original posts, long before this became a meme stonk, I literally used the word **imminent**  in the title, that's how sure I was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm. If you now notice, all of my titles are **What Comes Next?** That is because this is the honest truth: literally no one knows. Why? Because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and FOMO has worn off, more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum. 

This has gone from a sure thing, **to a straight up gamble.** 

If I had to give it a probability, which I really don't want to do I would have to say 50/50. There is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past $200, but it is still *possible* with catalysts and other factors. 

What appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death, people get bored, or a catalyst pops the MOASS's.

But you *can* be certain of one thing: **this will end.**

It does NOT have to end with a MOASS, but it might. My guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the MOASS by April, then this will be on pause. The interesting thing is that the *possibility* of a MOASS might never go away, but as time passes the *probability* lessens. 

The reason for my April guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers. It is very possible that this thing cools down after that, shorts enter unfavorable positions, and then Cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later.

That being said, I think the most *probable* outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly, we are just along the ride for. There is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen, we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next. How are they getting away with this? **You.** So long as the world things that Redditor's are the reason this is happening, they can continue playing.

# I've Been Asked By Many of You to Examine the DD posted by u/HeyItsPixeL 

[The DD can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/)

*Disclaimer: Both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else. You should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions.*

**Overall Impression:** Well done DD. There was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven. I will say, there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the author's narrative. From a more objective point of view, this simply could have been shorts shorting. From a less objective point of view, it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes. Let't go as chronologically as possible.

""On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!""

""**Conclusion:** Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!""

**My take:** I actually find this quite compelling. Either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell, or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze. Both ideas are equally nuts, but we live in crazy times.

""**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲""

**My Take:** I agree. Large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do. Either that or a whale buyer like Chamath. I also agree with the $50 assumption, as that was a clear battle ground. Where we disagree is I think that last week was in fact, the gamma squeeze. However, we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next, more important domino at $200+.

""On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). ""

**My Take:** Well, first of all I really wish there was a link to this data. But let's go with Fintel's data that shows 33 million short volume on 02/25. If you look at the chart for 02/25 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred. My guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140-180. This is one of the reasons I have been saying that the **135** resistance is a key point. If this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the **170 and 200** point, but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there? I'm not sure. I mean, I hope so! But I'm not sure.

**Anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding, I'm not even going to touch.** Why? Because it doesn't matter.

This goes back to my original point, everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen. But who cares? I think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock. What we need to be asking is WILL the squeeze be squozen and if so HOW?

**March 19th:** Including the options chain, XRT data, FTD's, etc. I think this date could in fact act as a catalyst. But that's about it. To me I would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it. There is a lot of good information backing this theory, but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory. In my opinion, this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either A: spark the MOASS or B: It could be the date of another microsqueeze.

**""MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable.""

**My take:** Absolutely not inevitable. Certainly possible.

# Monday Predictions

Again, this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off. I can't express that enough. That is why holding is gamble that could really go either way. If something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing. My predictions for Monday are based on no new catalysts.

Virtually, I am expecting a repeat of Friday that could end differently.

**Open:** I am expecting a sharp price increase at open, volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go. 

I imagine we will struggle at **115** resistance but we can hopefully blow through that, the real test will come at **135** resistance.

 If we reach **135** and blow through it, then this gets very interesting. I see the next resistance points at **150, 155, and then the really important ones of 170 and 200.** I already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a MOASS.

If we reach **135** but volume is too low (if you're not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it). If it takes more than two attempts, without a significant volume boost I can't imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points.

**Shortly after Open:** My guess right now is still before 10:00 (but it could go later in the day if I'm wrong about people covering on Friday) if we have not broken through those early resistance points, I think the slow bleed will begin. 

My bottom PT is somewhere between 60-80.

Once we hit this mark, it gets difficult to predict. No one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock. The closest I would say would be 40-50 since thats where the greatest support we had was. It is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 60-80 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover, the market see's it as a good point to enter and ride the wave, or if GME is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with.

After that, it's a blur. This truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly I cannot provide this kind of DD every single day. I don't have work Monday so I'm considering live streaming this.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

Now, some of you will call me a shill\_or\_whatever but I simply have a different tactic. You might believe in the MOASS, but I'm not certain I think it's *probable.* So I will be playing these mircosqueezes instead. 

I mentioned in my last post, I have a really nasty wash sale. From what I understand, this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by $100. IE if I purchase the stock for $80 my cost basis will be adjusted to $180. I'm still unclear on how this works, if someone could clarify in the comments section I would absolutely love to continue playing this stock. I will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well, so if I'm not responsive to the comments like I usually am, please understand I am attempting to prepare for this week.

So...as long as the wash sale isn't an actual reflection of my real price, then I will buy as soon as the market opens. I will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning, **I will buy more there to fight the good fight**. If it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase won't make a difference, then that will be my indicator to sell. 

**This part is vital:** If you are SELLING at the resistance points, you are hurting the cause. BUYING at these points is what will break through the wall. But if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling, then you might as well profit. You holding won't change the fact that we couldn't break resistance. **I can't stress this enough**. If you simply sell when we hit resistance, you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesn't happen. So either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets, but if it is lost no matter what you do, then sell and prepare for another attempt.

Once it gets below 90 I will start scooping up shares again, averaging down with the price (I do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom).

From there I will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again. If it does, I will sell at whatever I think the top is and then will re-enter just before close. Again, if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then I will not sell, I will buy to try to push through that resistance.

Why would I re-enter just before close? Three reasons:

1. I'm better positioned and back on board in case the MOASS does trigger
2. I won't have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on Tuesday.
3. I am bullish on GME thanks to Cohen and would like to re-open my long position.

If the same pattern continues Tuesday, I will repeat this play until the pattern stops and I am sitting on A LOT more shares at a MUCH BETTER cost basis.

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has not been squoze, but it has become closer to 50/50 odds that it will occur. I think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and I will play accordingly. Simply holding does not increase a price, buying does. My play will not only net me profits, but it will increase my buying power significantly. There is no TLDR to justify this post, if you don't feel like reading then you aren't playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways. Just remember, this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze. Happy trading!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, none of this is advice at all. It is my analysis of the situation that I have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand. The only direct advice I have for anyone is you should do what's best for you. I am bullish on GME long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if I end up with bags (as long as they aren't too heavy) that's perfectly fine with me. Anyone who tries to convince you I am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor, I am not even a bear on this situation, but you should always examine the bear case, not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias.*",2021-02-28,7464,1188
lugobr_DE,DE,Wondering where to set your sell limit for GME? Worried about missing the squeeze? Please read.,"First off, welcome to Wendys! Where our advice isn’t financial, and our burgers are stuffed with crayons!

I’ve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren’t sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you’ve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.

I’ve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn’t Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 2nd: $263

October 3rd: $277

October 6th: $292

October 7th: $287

October 8th: $294

October 9th: $296

October 10th: $342

October 13th: $353

October 14th: $352

October 15th: $390

October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**

October 17th: $358

October 20th: $277

October 21st: $242

October 22nd: $243

October 23rd: $229

October 24th: $210

October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn’t* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn’t matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want.*

**Has the Squeeze Been Sqoze? Absolutely not**

**Will the squeeze be sqoze? Potentially** 

**Strap in. This is going to be exhaustively long, but I have a lot to say.**

**Please** see my other work. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not a shill, I am not here for confirmation bias, I am a pragmatic, neutral party. Anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper DD on **me.** If you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate I have been thus far. Even in Part 5 I nearly perfectly predicted all of Friday's entire movements. 

**Note:** That does not mean I will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga. I also am not saying all of this to flex, it's because I am tired of being called a shill when I was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate. This doesn't mean you should take what I am saying as truth, but it does mean that if it doesn't align with your thoughts you should probably put down the kool-aid, loosen up the tin-foil hat, and listen to someone else's opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact, this isn't even advice. It is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been. One thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes. If people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in, please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say. 

**I also want to make it crystal clear that I think the squeeze has not been sqoze, however, the landscape is very different now.**

Finally, any PT’s including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict. Please do not take these as certain numbers. It’s the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens Monday.

# So What Happened Friday?

For the sake of this not being an entire novel, I encourage you to read Part 5 as I think that prediction is precisely what happened. To summarize, we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point, volume wasn't enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through, that's when selling and more shorting occurred. The price dipped down to around 88. Now, I didn't mention this in the DD but I did mention it in the comments section that I expect interesting price action around 2pm. Why? Because of the call options expiring ITM. 

I think these shares were already covered. I know we expect a higher price increase, but why? Where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions? 

Total Options That Expired On 02/26 ITM: **22,713** [Data from here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows)

This would equate to **2,271,300** shares 

At **13:02** the price fell to **\~86,** this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day. By **13:07** there was a volume of over **20,000,000** in the buying direction. 

Not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered. 

At **13:07** alone there was a positive net change in volume of **17,656,000** nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered...within 1 minute. 

The rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to **\~121**. Then it began falling off again, as did volume. 

Now, ask yourself...why would this be the case? Because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing, this was the ITM calls being covered. 

*At this point I'm sure you're ready to stop reading and call me a shill, but I encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next. This may not fit your narrative, and that's ok. A squeeze is possible, it might just be time to think that it won't be happening quite the way you imagined.*

# Before we move on to what comes next, let's play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding. 

For some reason, people still believe that holding your shares is preventing HF's from covering. I cannot express how untrue this sentiment is. Holding is a valid play, but it absolutely **should not** be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts. A 5 second look at any chart could show you there is **more than enough** sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them.

Let's take the largest post on r/gme as an example.

The top post of all time received **59,600** upvotes. According to the comments most people are actually holding only about 1-10 shares each. But for the sake of the argument let's get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns **100** shares of GME. Let's also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys.

That's a total of **5,960,000** shares that are being tucked away so HF's can't get their grubby little paws on them. On Friday alone, **91,960,000** shares were exchanged. So even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from. 

Holding is certainly a valid play, but there are two things holding certainly does not do:

1. It does not increase the price of a stock
2. It does not prevent HF's from covering

If you are holding solely because of these two reasons, then you are playing this wrong. There are three reasons to actually hold:

1. You absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent, so you are patiently waiting for it to occur.
2. You are already positioned extremely well like DFV who has a cost basis of 26.7896
3. You are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake, you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable. 

**If you don't believe me, then please examine the evidence.**

When you purchase a stock the price goes up, when you sell a stock the price goes down. So what happened when RH restricted trading? The price plummeted. Why? Because holding and selling were the only options.

Let's play another absurd game and pretend that 100% of shareholders held when trading was restricted. The price would have gone completely sideways, it would not have gone up or down.

But let's be realistic, that will never happen. Even if retail traders decided to hold, institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up. No, no. They are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense. You call them allies which they are not, they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100% gains while everyone else is waiting for 10,000% gains.

I want to pause for a moment in this DD and take a moment to point something out. Even though I'm not trying to convince anyone to sell, I have been called all sorts of names as though I'm evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation. But let's be absolutely clear. **You are the ones peer pressuring people into holding. You are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative. You are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope.** 

If you have made it this far, congratulations, I would love to have a discussion regarding the ""hold"" play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above. 

# My Thesis

My thesis remains the same, **the shorts want a short squeeze.** Yes, this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this. They need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round. They are reporting their losses publicly...but they have not disclosed their gains. 

I think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze. They open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers FOMO and market purchasing as well. This allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene. 

Once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak, they begin shorting on the way down, opening new, extremely favorable positions. The gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable ones...by a lot. 

Institutional traders are not stupid, they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze. They ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls. As I mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100% gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the Earth. 

So institutions ride it up, sell at the top, where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down. They then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again. Rinse and repeat.

I think the idea of the [Interstellar Yo-Yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/) was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component, ""Snidely"" in the story is *intentionally* doing this. 

A circumstance like GME will never happen again, when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that don't allow these kinds of things to happen. Institutions and HF's would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can.

So my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground. 

**Let's think about that for a moment.**

If your original PT on GME was $1000, you are already almost there.

The first squeeze took the price from \~$12 to \~$500, \~$488 increase.

The second squeeze took the price from \~$40 to $200, \~$160 increase.

So, already GME has increased around $648. You are now only a $352 increase away from your $1000 PT.

**Is a massive short squeeze still possible?**

**Yes.** However, so much of the DD floating around is all talking about *possibility* but we as investors don't care about that. We care about *probability.* 

So what is the probability of a massive short squeeze? Well, there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as Cohen joining the board. I think there are still several catalysts which I outline in [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). There could very well be new catalysts that I have not mentioned since that post, such as Cohen getting appointed CEO as I have learned many believe based on his Tweet. 

Let's talk numbers.

There are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible. 

$170 - This is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce, but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number.

$200 - This is a MASSIVE sell wall. Why? Well, I think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned. Probably not right at $200, they probably shorted \~$205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall.

If this sell wall falls, it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze *however* it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the $200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period. 

If this happens, it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over $400. At this point, FOMO + shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over $1000.

**But what is the** ***probability*** **that this will happen?**

Without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume.

Let's consider the first squeeze and volume for reference.

**Jan 22nd:** This was the highest volume at **197,157,900,** the high was 76.76 and the low was 42.32

Absolutely insane volume, but it didn't move the price all that much (I mean at least in comparison to other days)

**Jan 25th:** Volume **177,874,000 H:**159.18 **L:** 61.13

**Jan 26th:** Volume **178,588,000 H:**150.00 **L:** 80.20

**Jan 27th:** Volume **93,396,700 H:** 380.00 **L:** 249.00

**Jan 28th:** Volume **58,815,800 H:** 483.00 **L:** 112.25

**Jan 29th:** Volume **50,259,200 H:** 413.98 **L:** 250.00  


See the pattern?

**25th:** 177M volume to nearly triple the price (160%)

**26th:** Even more volume to only double the price (87%)

**27th:**  Half the volume for a 52% increase 

The volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasing/decreasing, with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted. These first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze. 

The 28th and beyond trading was restricted, but if everyone could only sell or hold, why wouldn't the price immediately fall? How could there still be support? This was shorts covering. Between just those two days there was \~109,000,000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell. A *perfect* time for shorts to cover. 

**But I thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up?** 

Absolutely...if trading wasn't restricted. Because virtually everyone could only sell, this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction FUD. 

So, as strange as it seems, I think the price going up was *some* shorts covering but for the most part, I think they covered while the price was falling. I know this *seems* counter-intuitive, but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered, the amount of selling was able to drive the price down *while* they covered. Again, think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted, *someone* was buying massive amounts of shares as the price fell...and it wasn't us.

**So, Hooman, if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible?**

Because of my thesis, entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions. Perhaps some of the old HF's also did to try to recoup some losses. Last week we *almost* forced this to happen all over again, but a TON of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at $200 prevented us from tipping that very important, very first domino. This isn't the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down, this is a different situation entirely. 

That situation is *still* squeezable. The question is...how?

Volume. Volume. Volume.   
Sheer and pure buying power.

We would *need* those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that $200 sell wall AND hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close. We were so damn close but couldn't quite break it. This is precisely why my predictions for Friday were so accurate.

A catalyst, a whale, large global sentiment again, FOMO; there are A LOT of different ways this is *possible,* but as I mentioned before; we as investors deal with *probable.*

In one of my original posts, long before this became a meme stonk, I literally used the word **imminent**  in the title, that's how sure I was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm. If you now notice, all of my titles are **What Comes Next?** That is because this is the honest truth: literally no one knows. Why? Because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and FOMO has worn off, more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum. 

This has gone from a sure thing, **to a straight up gamble.** 

If I had to give it a probability, which I really don't want to do I would have to say 50/50. There is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past $200, but it is still *possible* with catalysts and other factors. 

What appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death, people get bored, or a catalyst pops the MOASS's.

But you *can* be certain of one thing: **this will end.**

It does NOT have to end with a MOASS, but it might. My guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the MOASS by April, then this will be on pause. The interesting thing is that the *possibility* of a MOASS might never go away, but as time passes the *probability* lessens. 

The reason for my April guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers. It is very possible that this thing cools down after that, shorts enter unfavorable positions, and then Cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later.

That being said, I think the most *probable* outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly, we are just along the ride for. There is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen, we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next. How are they getting away with this? **You.** So long as the world things that Redditor's are the reason this is happening, they can continue playing.

# I've Been Asked By Many of You to Examine the DD posted by u/HeyItsPixeL 

[The DD can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/)

*Disclaimer: Both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else. You should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions.*

**Overall Impression:** Well done DD. There was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven. I will say, there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the author's narrative. From a more objective point of view, this simply could have been shorts shorting. From a less objective point of view, it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes. Let't go as chronologically as possible.

""On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!""

""**Conclusion:** Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!""

**My take:** I actually find this quite compelling. Either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell, or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze. Both ideas are equally nuts, but we live in crazy times.

""**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲""

**My Take:** I agree. Large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do. Either that or a whale buyer like Chamath. I also agree with the $50 assumption, as that was a clear battle ground. Where we disagree is I think that last week was in fact, the gamma squeeze. However, we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next, more important domino at $200+.

""On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). ""

**My Take:** Well, first of all I really wish there was a link to this data. But let's go with Fintel's data that shows 33 million short volume on 02/25. If you look at the chart for 02/25 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred. My guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140-180. This is one of the reasons I have been saying that the **135** resistance is a key point. If this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the **170 and 200** point, but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there? I'm not sure. I mean, I hope so! But I'm not sure.

**Anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding, I'm not even going to touch.** Why? Because it doesn't matter.

This goes back to my original point, everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen. But who cares? I think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock. What we need to be asking is WILL the squeeze be squozen and if so HOW?

**March 19th:** Including the options chain, XRT data, FTD's, etc. I think this date could in fact act as a catalyst. But that's about it. To me I would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it. There is a lot of good information backing this theory, but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory. In my opinion, this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either A: spark the MOASS or B: It could be the date of another microsqueeze.

**""MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable.""

**My take:** Absolutely not inevitable. Certainly possible.

# Monday Predictions

Again, this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off. I can't express that enough. That is why holding is gamble that could really go either way. If something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing. My predictions for Monday are based on no new catalysts.

Virtually, I am expecting a repeat of Friday that could end differently.

**Open:** I am expecting a sharp price increase at open, volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go. 

I imagine we will struggle at **115** resistance but we can hopefully blow through that, the real test will come at **135** resistance.

 If we reach **135** and blow through it, then this gets very interesting. I see the next resistance points at **150, 155, and then the really important ones of 170 and 200.** I already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a MOASS.

If we reach **135** but volume is too low (if you're not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it). If it takes more than two attempts, without a significant volume boost I can't imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points.

**Shortly after Open:** My guess right now is still before 10:00 (but it could go later in the day if I'm wrong about people covering on Friday) if we have not broken through those early resistance points, I think the slow bleed will begin. 

My bottom PT is somewhere between 60-80.

Once we hit this mark, it gets difficult to predict. No one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock. The closest I would say would be 40-50 since thats where the greatest support we had was. It is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 60-80 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover, the market see's it as a good point to enter and ride the wave, or if GME is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with.

After that, it's a blur. This truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly I cannot provide this kind of DD every single day. I don't have work Monday so I'm considering live streaming this.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

Now, some of you will call me a shill\_or\_whatever but I simply have a different tactic. You might believe in the MOASS, but I'm not certain I think it's *probable.* So I will be playing these mircosqueezes instead. 

I mentioned in my last post, I have a really nasty wash sale. From what I understand, this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by $100. IE if I purchase the stock for $80 my cost basis will be adjusted to $180. I'm still unclear on how this works, if someone could clarify in the comments section I would absolutely love to continue playing this stock. I will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well, so if I'm not responsive to the comments like I usually am, please understand I am attempting to prepare for this week.

So...as long as the wash sale isn't an actual reflection of my real price, then I will buy as soon as the market opens. I will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning, **I will buy more there to fight the good fight**. If it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase won't make a difference, then that will be my indicator to sell. 

**This part is vital:** If you are SELLING at the resistance points, you are hurting the cause. BUYING at these points is what will break through the wall. But if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling, then you might as well profit. You holding won't change the fact that we couldn't break resistance. **I can't stress this enough**. If you simply sell when we hit resistance, you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesn't happen. So either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets, but if it is lost no matter what you do, then sell and prepare for another attempt.

Once it gets below 90 I will start scooping up shares again, averaging down with the price (I do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom).

From there I will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again. If it does, I will sell at whatever I think the top is and then will re-enter just before close. Again, if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then I will not sell, I will buy to try to push through that resistance.

Why would I re-enter just before close? Three reasons:

1. I'm better positioned and back on board in case the MOASS does trigger
2. I won't have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on Tuesday.
3. I am bullish on GME thanks to Cohen and would like to re-open my long position.

If the same pattern continues Tuesday, I will repeat this play until the pattern stops and I am sitting on A LOT more shares at a MUCH BETTER cost basis.

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has not been squoze, but it has become closer to 50/50 odds that it will occur. I think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and I will play accordingly. Simply holding does not increase a price, buying does. My play will not only net me profits, but it will increase my buying power significantly. There is no TLDR to justify this post, if you don't feel like reading then you aren't playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways. Just remember, this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze. Happy trading!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, none of this is advice at all. It is my analysis of the situation that I have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand. The only direct advice I have for anyone is you should do what's best for you. I am bullish on GME long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if I end up with bags (as long as they aren't too heavy) that's perfectly fine with me. Anyone who tries to convince you I am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor, I am not even a bear on this situation, but you should always examine the bear case, not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias.*",2021-02-28,7460,1188
ltudu7_PG,PG,"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY","Hey folks!
I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.

Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:

So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).
I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:




TL;DR:
You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.



Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic.
Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:

you start with ~0~ shares
you borrow one from a broker
you now have ~1~ shares
you sell that share, completing your short
you now have ~0~ shares

Now imagine the short squeeze happens.
And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.
The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).

Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:
Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. 
You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.

you start with ~0~ shares
you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!
you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe”
you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!

Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! 
Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: 

THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO
The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?

Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.
Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.


If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations.
Now think about that again.


Effective TL;DR 2.0:

People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?
Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.

But here’s MY question:
What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? 
VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.


Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not.
Joy to all,

[GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrxbvv/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4/)

Before we get into what happened today I would like you all to know that I have sadly closed my position. I sold at the top today and then wanted to buy back in at the bottom but forgot about a little thing called wash sales. That being said when I purchased at 147 my cost basis was actually showing at \~250. Now, this is just for tax purposes however it was factored into margin and completely eliminated me from other trades and would have kept me sidelined for quite some time. I made the decision to close my position entirely and put a large sum of my capital into ACTC which will be my next DD. Sadly, I need to wait 30 days for the wash sale to wear off before I could re-enter GME. This bars me from participating in any upcoming squeezes without substantial risk and it prevents me from entering a long position prior to the 3/25 Earnings Report. This is very sad news indeed. However, I am extremely interested in what is happening and will continue monitoring the situation. I might play options although they are entirely to hard to predict, but I will be re-entering as soon as the wash sale wears off.

Side note: I am feeling better but not well enough to film, so for those who have been waiting for videos this week I do apologize, I will have content coming out as soon as I am able to record.

**So let's talk about today**

Well, if you read my last DD (Part 4) today went exactly as expected all the way up until the end. There was one crucial part I missed and that was the top of the downward channel which was $170. I kept mentioning $200 as an important number but completely disregarding the top of the channel. 

Alright, so pre-market kind of went sideways and that seemed to bode well for us. At open we saw a massive dip, my prediction was that this would be a sell-off of profit taking and bag holders leaving with their original investment. I still maintain that belief. We found the bottom at around $102 which was impressive to me so the following bounce seemed natural. We had several halts along the way and I want to clarify to everyone that this is completely normal.

Halting trades happens for those of us who can't be behind a computer at all times. It gives us a moment to catch up and make our decision. It also prevents a price from plummeting due to panic selling as it essentially pauses the trade to let people calm down and orders hold off for a second. It works well in the opposite direction to prevent FOMO from kicking in and prices rising to irrational heights quickly. 

I think a majority of the price action today was a combination of poorly positioned shorts covering and FOMO for a second squeeze. That in conjunction we scalpers and day traders, I think we simply had a lot of people playing this for profits on this push which gave us the volume and buying power we needed to surpass certain levels. 

We tested a few places on the way up, and some of those tests were rejected. The volume was able to push us through after 1-3 attempts. However, we met with the top of the channel, the $170 mark and at that point, we had no more gas, we had no more volume. We simply couldn't break through, there was a false break which brought us to the days high, but not enough to truly break out. If we did break it we would have been met by the massive sell wall at $200 which we surely would not have had the volume to break. We then were completely exhausted and were forced down significantly. In short, today was not our day.

There is a silver lining, even with AH we somehow ended up finishing over $106. This gives me hope. Let's immediately hop into what comes next.

**So...what comes next?**

All of the catalysts mentioned in Part 4 are still in effect, this has not changed. There are still many shorts sitting above $200 and some probably opened positions on the way down again. 

**Tomorrow** there is something still interesting to me. The fact that we ended over $100 and options expire tomorrow makes me thing there is still gas in this rocket to go for a second push tomorrow. No bears, no one really, could have expected this to close over $100 today, so a lot of calls are dangerously ITM. Tomorrow will be an all out assault for sure to try to drive the price as low as possible prior to the options expiring. Not only will this assault need to be dealt with, but nothing has changed with the $170 channel ceiling or the Wall of Troy at $200. Be warned folks, this is a battle. It is winnable, but a battle indeed. 

Without a known catalyst, this will be *extremely* difficult to win. Many things could happen, from whales jumping in to last minute news such as Cohen being named CEO (a leading theory regarding Ryan Cohen's mysterious tweet). 

Tomorrow, I expect the opposite reaction from today. Before I elaborate I would like to remind everyone: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I a wizard. I could be completely wrong about all of this. So please, do your research, make your decisions. Don't base your financial choices off of my one opinion. 

I digress, I expect an opposite reaction tomorrow with all the diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla. So I expect a massive run-up right at open. The question is...will it be enough? **Pay close attention to volume tomorrow and pay close attention to important resistance points we say today: 135, 152,155, 170.**

If volume low, that means everyone is waiting for everyone else to do something; this is assuredly a losing strategy. There will need to be a significant amount of volume to break through the first wall at 135. Hold on.

To make this more clear it is actually good to think of this like war. Imagine volume as the number of troops you have and imagine each resistance point as a gate you are storming. If you don't have the troops (volume) to break through the first gate (resistance point), you will need to regroup (consolidate) and try again. But each of these attempts uses more and more troops (volume), which means less (troops) to fight break through the following gates (resistance points).

So pay attention to volume and pay attention to resistance points and how many attempts you are taking to break each one. Without a general (a catalyst/whale) this will be a very difficult and potentially bloody battle tomorrow. 

From the oppositions perspective, they have two options. They could either bring troops out to meet you (try to force the price down right at open) or they can sit behind their gates and hold the line (bull trap). As I mentioned before, my guess is they will bull trap, why? Because that's what I would do. If we knew you couldn't break the 170 resistance on the first attempt with your whole army, why would we be concerned about reaching it with less troops? Again, volume is key to monitor.

If you see low volume + sharp price increase, it is likely the bull trap I am expecting, so have buy orders ready to go near resistance points and don't waste your resources trying to climb to them. 

If you see high volume + sharp price increase, then they probably sent troops out to meet you but you are winning.

If you see low volume + sharp price decrease, then it seems your reinforcements haven't arrived and you will need a miracle to save you.

If you see high volume + sharp price decrease, then they are winning.

If you are driven back then at least you are driven to reinforcements (IE: If the price is sent downward then it will be a good buying opportunity for more people to jump in and help the fight). Again, volume here is key. If you see a bounce back, make sure the volume is high enough to justify it, otherwise you are charging back into battle without enough reinforcements and will certainly lose. 

**After Tomorrow**

Until April I see potential for a squeeze, one even larger than the first. But every day that passes, every micro-squeeze in between weakens our side. Play it smart. Sell at what you think is the top, buy back in at the bottom. Rinse. Repeat. This gives each person more and more capital on every attempt. Placing buy orders around the resistance points to help break down the gates is essential. I want to clarify here, the only people who should be playing this are ones who are long on GME to begin with. At some point, this will all settle down, come back to Earth and you will be left with a lot of shares (especially if you keep selling and re-entering). 

The reason this works is because it's literally exactly what the shorts want. **The shorts want a short squeeze.** Yeah see, I said it. Everyone on every side is profiting on this phenomenon aside from the few casualties (bag holders) caught in the crossfire. They drive the price down by shorting it, then they cover to help trigger the short squeeze. You all ride it on the way up allowing them to open new very favorable positions not possible on other stocks and they ride it back down. The cycle continues. 

This is going to be the unfavored opinion, but the notion of diamond handing it til death isn't a winning tactic unless you have the capital to continue adding at the bottom. To win the war, that capital must be generated and what better way than this infinite game of profitable yo-yo?

**Diamond handing worked when there was 226% short interest and that is no longer the case.** 

**Diamond handing does not force a short squeeze, it only did the first time due to these conditions.** 

**Diamond handing worked because the shorts would be screwed if there was no one to buy their shares anymore, this is no longer reality. People are willing to sell their shares, if the price action doesn't convince you of that I don't know what will.** 

There is only one way to force a short squeeze. **Power.** Buying power that is. 

Again, I am not giving advice. This is my perspective and how I think a squeeze is possible WITHOUT a catalyst. 

**TL;DR:** I am not a spreader of FUD, I am a realist. If you are going to continue playing GME then you should find a way to profit from it. Volume is key. Important prices are: 135, 150, 155, 170, 200. The potential for tomorrow squeezing certainly exists with us finishing off at $106. They would have needed to send it much lower to make this be over. However, without a catalyst it will be a difficult battle indeed. This very well may have been the second squeeze, but as I mentioned in Part 4, I don't expect it to be the last one if it is, in fact, over.

[GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 4 (Micro Update)](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lm92zw/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4_micro/)

Before I get started I want to apologize, this will be a smaller less detailed version than I had hoped and I will not be releasing a video as I feel extremely under the weather. However, I have received a large volume of messages regarding part 4 and my analysis, so here it is.

First, let's address something that I find very misleading: ""this happened on absolutely no news""

Well, that simply isn't true. I will mention some key things that led up to this point and would like to also quickly mention the 3-day rule. If ER is bad, you follow the 3 day rule meaning you give it 3 days to bleed before it begins to recover. This is the same for the news cycle. Even the first squeeze when Cohen was announced to be joining the board, it took several days before the market react.

Ok, so let's talk news. 

1. We have passed the first potential catalyst which was the first GME hearing [which unfortunately, was filled with useless information](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lnkmrn/gamestop_gme_short_squeeze_congressional_hearing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
2. Another catalyst I mentioned was today, the short interest report that was post Jan. 28th spike. [Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) is reporting 60% and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) is reporting 24%. Again, the discrepancy between the two is simply based on a calculation difference using a different float. One is including synthetic longs while the other is not. This is the first mention I could find regarding the [XRT discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/) and how shorts may have actually essentially moved their positions into an ETF that includes GameStop. At this point, there are so many moving parts and distrust, I'm having trouble assessing what the true short interest might be. Regardless, even if we use the 24% figure and respect that to be true, [this is still considered very high.](https://www.powercycletrading.com/what-is-a-high-short-interest-ratio/#:~:text=Regardless%2C%20most%20options%20traders%20would,above%2020%25%20is%20extremely%20high)
3. Following [iborrowdesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) we can also see a significant amount of new short positions opening over the past several days, probably an attempt to short the stock but without it being reported in todays numbers.
4. Chamath also expressed anger regarding how the Congressional hearing went and followed it up with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1363571801289154560). I personally believe Chamath was one of the several large buy orders today.
5. Ryan Cohen also [tweeted one of his infamous emoji tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289). Now, I'm not going to bother to attempt to decipher it, but when he Tweets, GME spikes much like when Elon tweets about Doge, it spikes. 
6. The [GameStop CFO ""resigns""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/23/tech/gamestop-cfo-resigns/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20After,his%20roles%20on%20March%2026) which later news indicates he didn't really willingly resign. This is extremely bullish as GameStop continues to make changes. If the company was losing money for years and the man in charge of money was just fired, this is a *good* thing.
7. [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/)

**Ok, now let's discuss some of these things**

1. The GameStop hearing was simply a joke. The next hearing will paint a more clear picture regarding data as the SEC, FINRA, and potentially, the DTCC will be present.
2. Let's talk short interest. As I have mentioned in previous parts, I have no doubt that original shorts have covered and new shorts have entered. A clear battle I have had in the comments is a lot of individuals seem to believe that shorts only re-opened their positions at the top and that's it. I couldn't disagree with this more. The narrative of GME being a dying brick and mortar company is alive and well, and shorts will continue opening positions all the way down. We saw many new positions open today when it was around $50. There are shorts everywhere, and they completely doubt this company and everyones willingness to hold and continue purchasing more, both for retailers and institutions. 
3. Chamath, Cohen, and DFV was a much needed intervention which brought back excitement and truthfully, they probably purchased more shares themselves. 

**Sorry had to take a bathroom break, like I said I'm feeling very unwell and apologize that this isn't quite as good as my other posts.**

**Let's talk about what happened today**

I believe today was a gamma squeeze with shorts in the worst positions having to cover. I concur with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/) regarding the gamma squeeze and how it started the domino effect. 

I predicted that a large sum of shorts were sitting just over $200 and the AH action helps bolster that claim. We saw the price touch $200 for a moment and then get swatted down like it was a gnat. They absolutely do not want it to break the $200 mark.

**But onto the important part, my predictions as to what comes next**

Now, I'm about to say something very silly but the reason is I want you to make your own decision on what the most likely outcome is.

Tomorrow, either the price will come plummeting down, or it will rise to new, extraordinary heights.

1. Reason for it to shoot down: There are a lot of bagholders, a lot of individuals who are simply trying to escape with at least their money back. Depending on pre-market, we could expect a large sell off at open as people reclaim their losses. This sell-off will induce a panic sell that causes everyone to exit in an attempt to mitigate as many losses as possible.
2. Reason for it to shoot up: There are a lot of bagholders...who won't be satisfied by just breaking even and will refuse to exit until it breaks $1000-$2000. Depending on pre-market there will also be a lot of people who missed the first run have less doubt in their mind for a potential second run. FOMO and sheer buying power will continue to drive the price upward.

Both of these are considering retail investors only, although the ATH price action compared to volume suggests there are significant amounts of institutional and ""large whale"" buyers getting in on the action. They both are also dependent on pre-market so let's talk about that for a moment.

**Pre-Market**

While institutional buyers don't necessarily need retail for this to work, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have reinforcements, so I think they won't begin a bull run until the market opens and retail investors have a final chance to double down while new investors have a chance to purchase their tickets. 

However, if they seemingly don't care and want to buy as soon as able then we will test that $200 resistance. If that is broken...this is going to be absolutely wild. The domino effect will continue upward chasing the shorts who entered at the very top. It would be wise for these shorts to cover prior to it reaching them as they could still take profits and walk away with a significant sum of money. This will propel the price extremely high at which point nearly all shorts would have exited. 

**During Trading Hours**

Again, completely dependent on pre-market, but I still expect a decent sell-off in the beginning of the day as bagholders escape with breaking even happily. If we open above the $200 mark and the selloff does not appear to be driving us below, I expect the shorts who entered their to cover and this reaches parabolic heights.

**Price Targets**

Well, I first want to talk about the infinite squeeze notion. I agree with the sentiment but not for the same reasons most users post about. Here's the thing, everyone still considers GME to be a dying brick and mortar retailer aside from few longs such as myself. That narrative is slowly changing as more and more individuals start to see the significant changes being made within the company. So long as this mentality lives on...so does repetition.

I expect this squeeze to conclude sometime this week, perhaps even tomorrow. What's unique here is we have all now lived through the first one and we will make decisions accordingly, IE taking profits or covering earlier. 

But on the way back down....shorts will open new positions....again. 

A new catalyst will arrive....again.

And we will squeeze...again.

I'm not sure how many times this will happen, but I think after 3/25 ER when Cohen globally explains the changes being made and the plans for the company, the narrative will begin to change on GME's business. Until the narrative changes, I expect shorts to continue re-entering at dangerous positions. $50 sounds like a fantastic place to short if you believe this is a dead company, but the market sentiment is changing rapidly on the potential of this company. Once shorts are only entering at ridiculously high numbers, then we will finally see the end of the GME saga. 

I think a second squeeze will be evidence enough to shorts to not enter at such low numbers, however, greed and doubt goes a long way. So it's very possible this is the final squeeze, but I'm not holding my breath. I will address how I plan on playing this in the next section, but first, some price targets.

So long as we break the $200 resistance, we will have many short positions above that level that will close to avoid getting caught in the red as well as gamma squeeze mechanics at play. That being said, I could see $500 being possible as early as tomorrow. Now the top is so difficult to predict because one of the largest factors is the most unpredictable; the people. Many people were burned by GME and many others have serious FOMO. If there is large volume, then that will be my indicator that people are piling in all over again. If this is the case, I see $1-$2k being possible. If bagholders simply want to exit and take their money back then I think $500 might be the dream peak. 

**So whats your play Hooman?**

Well, as I have said before I am long on GME. So I will be trimming on the way up and leaving some just in case it continues to parabolic heights. I will then re-enter when I believe we hit the bottom which I feel confident starting to re-enter at $70 adding more on the way down. I will then hold tight for another potential squeeze and repeat this process until finally, the GameStop narrative has changed and I could leave my shares along for several years. 

**Again, I do apologize** 

I know this isn't quite as good as my previous posts, but I wanted to update everyone who was asking me to provide them with my analysis. Part 5 will be coming regardless of what happens tomorrow as I stated numerous times, I don't think this story is anywhere near over, not until April do I think we will start seeing it slow down. 

**TL;DR:** Today was most likely a gamma squeeze coupled with some shorts covering. There were significant catalysts and whales to propel this thing. I don't think the GameStop story is anywhere near over. I'm sick sorry this was choppy writing compared to other posts.

lrrcdk_GME,GME,GME Gamma Squeeze Part Two?,"Here is what I think happened today. 

Looking at the options chain, 25k $50 call options expiring this Friday were purchased today. Assuming that the delta was .5, that is 1.25 million shares that was bought to gamma hedge. Then the price of the GME stocks started to rise causing a chain reaction in MMs covering.

If you look at the $60 call options, 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was .5, that’s another 1.15 million shares that were purchased to hedge. 

Another 17-18k options were purchased between $51-$59, which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up. 

This is entirely assuming that delta on those were .5. If the Delta was higher = more shares were bought.

We’ve had this shit happen before last month. 

So get ready. If this is a gamma squeeze part II, the fall will be just as fast as the moon. 

But I’m just an ordinary dude (not an expert or a specialist in this field). This post is also not financial advice. DYOR.

I made the worst mistake jumping on the AMC trend and it shattered my portfolio. Pretty much what I deserve from following the trend and deviating from my strategy, but it’s demoralizing to say the least. My portfolio went from up 110% to down 50%, so I’ve lost half my original investment.

Any advice from people who have been in a similar situation, lost a bunch of gains and are currently negative? 

It took me like 6 months to get over that “FOMO” mindset. The second I followed it again, I pretty much lost it all.

lol283_O,O,"Theory: Gamestop was in the process of going bankrupt, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Melvin were in the process of profiting from inside information obtained from GME real estate division.","Edit: They made me my own flair so I'm guessing I'm onto something lmao

So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.

Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.

Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I'm retarded but you apes help me to see if I'm crazy or autistic.

The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:

[https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb\_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf)

CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.

The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.

But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.

Gamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.

Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.

I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol

But then I did some other digging and found a random document:

[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0)

Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.

On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:

GOLDMAN SACHS & CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT

Idk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.

I looked further into it and found:

[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)

**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC

Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.

And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can't find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:

[https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage](https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage)

So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop's regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 ([https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/](https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/)) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?

And then at that point word got around to Melvin who's probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it's a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?

Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they've ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin's hard insider traded tendies.

It's a cooky theory but plausible.

ln3z3a_GME,GME,GME Shares are Pumped Up Pre-Market Nearly Every Morning By Hedge Funds Then Sold Off to Cause Negative Looking Sentiment Going into Market,"This has been a pattern that has been repeating for weeks for GME shares, pre-market pumps and dumps to cause charts to look like they are ready for a slide to trick technical/chart traders.

This is a trick that even Cramer would use during his hedge fund days as he discusses in this interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ckpMQ4tgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ckpMQ4tgE)

The Market is clearly being manipulated on the daily by hedge funds. This chart is for 2-18-21, showing GME shares where pumped up to $50 pre-market, peaking around 9AM, then sold off going into market open at 9:30AM. This is one of many examples, which I will continue to monitor and update regularly. Don't fall for their BS.

I bought shares at the end of the day near $40. (I guess I should say: THANK YOU hedge funds for giving me a sweet deal).

For those planning to buy shares, if you buy a few shares every week, you can cost average in, and ride out the volatility. Anytime hedge funds want to push prices lower, those become buying opportunities for new participants to get shares at a discount. Today it was 10% off, weeeeeeee! 💎💎 <Diamond balls.

Tonight’s hearing will investigate the incredible price push on GME stocks fuelled by WallStreetBets and the following blockage of buying orders by Robinhood, allegedly in order to protect hedge funds shorting these same stocks. 

Ordinary guys from the Internet forcing Wall Street’s hand is not something you came across often, but certainly something that will happen more and more. In an attempt to buy back its credibility Robinhood itself is shifting its centralized modus operandi: in a series of recent tweets they announced the intention to build solutions for crypto deposit and withdrawals, a basic option that was previously denied to its users. 

Let’s see how it goes 😊

llmiu1_BHP,BHP,DDDD - Was GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold Part 2 (A look at Jan 15 to 29 SEC Data),"In this DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be analyzing some Failure to Deliver (FTD) data released by the SEC for Jan 15 - 29 to definitively see if there's been any shady shit going on with GME; namely, illegal (or legal by MMs?) naked short selling. This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**What is a Failure to Deliver?**

A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.

**Methodology & Caveats**

I'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is

1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?
2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?
3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**

The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.

Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.

**The Code**

Feel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.

Hopefully, this data speaks for itself, but as a TLDR

What does stand out is that GME has the most days with FTD > $25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (> $1B) in the SEC list

but

Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you **normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers**. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn't look like there's any systematic fraud going on.

llmiu1_COP,COP,DDDD - Was GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold Part 2 (A look at Jan 15 to 29 SEC Data),"In this DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be analyzing some Failure to Deliver (FTD) data released by the SEC for Jan 15 - 29 to definitively see if there's been any shady shit going on with GME; namely, illegal (or legal by MMs?) naked short selling. This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**What is a Failure to Deliver?**

A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.

**Methodology & Caveats**

I'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is

1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?
2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?
3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**

The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.

Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.

**The Code**

Feel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.

Hopefully, this data speaks for itself, but as a TLDR

What does stand out is that GME has the most days with FTD > $25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (> $1B) in the SEC list

but

Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you **normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers**. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn't look like there's any systematic fraud going on.

This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**What is a Failure to Deliver?**

A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.

**Methodology & Caveats**

I'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is

1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?
2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?
3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**

The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.

Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.

**The Code**

Feel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.

Hopefully, this data speaks for itself, but as a TLDR

What does stand out is that GME has the most days with FTD > $25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (> $1B) in the SEC list

but

Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you **normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers**. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn't look like there's any systematic fraud going on.

ll68pc_SLV,SLV,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day.","Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

likb1g_GME,GME,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. (This post has a lot of sources but in order to push this through I've had to remove most of the link, you can pm me for sources if you'd like)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist. Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is covering using synthetic long shares or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started withreading SEC Regulation SHO which deals with naked short selling. “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**""

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**.

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"".

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when RHood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at RHood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between RHoodand Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of RHoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to RHood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars. So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.”

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.”

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**.

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”**

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a Redditor brought up: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**",2021-02-12,1162,147

lhujhn_GME,GME,Weed stocks are NOT like GME.,"Someone needed to say this. 

There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also ample signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.

That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like ""weed is dead"" and ""I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz.""

For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.

These are not short squeeze/hype/meme stocks. Please stop looking at them as such.

Edit for clarification: People seem to think that I’m bragging? about holding for over a month. I’m not. I only brought up that I entered into a position over a month ago to say that I bought shares based on the company-I didn’t buy shares within the last couple of days because Reddit was hyping it. Congratulations to everyone who has been holding this stock for much longer than I have!

Remember: the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last December, only for that legislation to die in the Senate, still controlled by the GOP. Now that Dems have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization. Obviously that would be enormous for the marijuana industry, so people are grabbing shares now, ahead of the potential explosion in growth.

lgpn8y_V,V,NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest,"**The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded ""upstairs"" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...**
* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**
* **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
* **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.**

&#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Comparing NYSE to OFF-EXCHANGE short volume with respect to GME's Float.](https://preview.redd.it/4qhtpaqqflg61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ca1196548a84f92c5c8d87b1c83b2f863cf812)

* Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Short Volume\/Total Volume from FINRA and NYSE Daily Short Volume files, respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0zdmv7czlg61.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=df17986998464f35f8053bb0c3c3daa92285cdf2)

* Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.
* Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+

&#x200B;

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

&#x200B;

|FINRA|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|84,529,878|155,033,361|79,236,275|
|Short Exempt Volume|1,119,003|**3,437,532**|**4,306,437**|
|Total Volume|193,791,490|415,527,741|146,617,603.00|
|Short Vol/Float|1.80|3.31|1.69|

# NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!

&#x200B;

|NYSE|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|13,279,699|49,046,558|19,041,023|
|Short Exempt Volume|587,776|**5,075,452**|**7,304,781**|
|Total Volume|31,822,868|105,950,709|43,875,824|
|Short Vol/Float|0.28|1.05|0.41|

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

# NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker...

# Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?

# RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!

*""For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes.""*\-  [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:**

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2. **""Short Exempts""are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**
4. **Still waiting on FINRA for the**  [**FINRA Monthly Short Sale File**](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021)

&#x200B;

Not advice of any kind, I should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit, and I miss chewy runts!

Edit:  u/SolveThisProblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for SI: In the post I used short/(outstanding shares (yahoo finance) to calculate the 226% to 78% SI change, however Morningstar/FINRA  use shorts/ float which is (Outstanding Shares - Insider Holdings - Untrading lnst.

lgkm5t_PATH,PATH,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3,"GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say ""it"" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, ""it"", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including ""synthetic longs"" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a ""what-if"" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many ""what-if's"" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. ""It's two weeks old"". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) ""The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.""

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/25 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes ""just happen"". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), was at the time ""inevitable"" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Beginning of April), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from ""get over it, the squeeze happened"" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

But lately I’ve noticed this sub only talks about GME. Will it ever stop? 

Let’s face it, GME isn’t going to the moon anytime soon. The short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share IOUs as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. And since the stock isn’t paying dividends, and the company’s revenue is going down the toilet, there’s really no big downside to them doing so. Maybe Ryan Cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.

Anyways I’d like to see this sub return to its roots. Ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about GME. Anyone else agree? There’s more stocks to invest in than GME, many of them more promising and with higher upside.

lfxux0_PATH,PATH,Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

[https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-the-greeks-to-understand-options/](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-the-greeks-to-understand-options/)

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

May the gains be with you",2021-02-09,6909,635

leorks_PATH,PATH,"Evidence points to GME Shorts not having covered but pretending they did (via the use of options to illegally ""cover"" with synthetic long shares) to break the squeeze","Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. *(This is a re-post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned. I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)*

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

ldzb68_GME,GME,"GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.","This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a think, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting to manual approval only.  

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to lose even a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the kindergarten aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of Christ try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

ldqva1_DNA,DNA,GME and future of WSB ?,"Fellow retards,

I have a couple points I'd like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I'm not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.

I've been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn't make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.

WSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.

However, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It's what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a ""movement"". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 4.2069% Now we cannot hear them due to noise.

Now, the sub is filled with people who just yell ""HOLD!!!!!"" ""BUY MORE"" ""WHO HOLDS????"" ""GME WILL GO TO MOON"". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.

A hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of ""WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME"" I'd love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won't help US.

I wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I'd be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don't get new info. We don't get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.

We need to find our next GMEs. That's how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.

tl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES. Otherwise GME can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make TENDIES

ldjbg1_V,V,"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)","Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts.

BUT! I spent the last year taking 20% gains here and there with a 10% stop loss... you know where that got me? Fucking net zero gains across the board. Quite frankly I’m embarrassed by how little I’m paying in capital gains for 2020 and I know a lot of you feel the same fucking way. 

So Riddle me this my fellow Retard Investors...

1)Why would we sell when the charts show clear manipulation?
2)Why would we sell when the number of shares changing hands has flatlined the past week?

And lastly you beautifully autistic rabble rousers! 

WHY WOULD YOU SELL FOR AN 80% LOSS! 

It blows my fucking mind how many people are giving in right now... JUST KIDDING BECAUSE NOBODY IS ACTUALLY SELLING YOU FUCKING IDIOTS(speaking directly to Melvin, Citadel, and the SEC)!  THE GME DIAMOND HANDS HAVE DECIDED TO BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES BECAUSE (SPOILER ALERT!) DFV WAS PROPPED UP BY THE COMMUNITY AND IS NOW THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE STORY AND ALLEGEDLY UNDER INVESTIGATION! The deck is stacked against us, and they have every reason in the world to pull out all the stops to FUCK YOU OVER! 

That is why this hurts so much... because we have wounded them so mortally over GAMESTOP OF ALL FUCKING COMPANIES! So you better believe they want you to feel the pain. 

Before I delete the Reddit app from my phone... let me explain the difference between us and them... 1)When we take a position, we know that there are no guarantees and if you lose, you fucking lose NO TAKE BACKS! 
2)When we get hurt, we don’t go on fucking CNBC to cry about it! We log onto WSB and post that lost porn while our wives are out fucking Chad for a dinner at red lobster!

I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven't shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.

But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.

Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.

lbv6iy_PARA,PARA,GME Rollercoaster,"Listen up bag holders, 💎🖐, short bus riders.  

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling.

I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**

Hello all, 

I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.

**First let's talk about yesterday**

There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).

Another large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.

1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2. They haven't covered yet

I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create ""phantom shares"" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. ""With [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations."" From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.

Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. 

So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.

Now, I'm not saying ""nobody sold"" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. 

Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.

**Today**

So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.

1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.
2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.

Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. 

Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. 

So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. 

My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. 

So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. 

But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.

Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. 

So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.

**So when will this second squeeze happen?**

If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.

**In summary**

I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. 

Positions:

1100 GME @ $16 closed

500 GME @ $20 closed

50 GME @ $120 open

236 GME @ $250 open

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.

Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever. Retail investors have more power than we think.",2021-02-03,21913,3795

lbsae4_RIO,RIO,GME and what I've learned about the market.,"Ok Tards,

Like the rest of you, I bandwagoned GME hard and became part of the cult. Lucky for me, I've been losing money here for years and got that panic urge to do my own DD the other day.

Having gone through *literally thousands* of posts, I've realized most of you are folding tinfoil into hats and turning relatively mundane things into full-blown conspiracies. For real y'all are becoming Flat Earthers. Here's what I mean.

1. **Short Ladder Attacks** \- Not a real thing. Someone here made this term up.
2. **Synthetic Shares** \- Very cool and very legal. Synthetic shares were created by the Shorts buying calls to hedge their bets. Lets say you short 100 shares of a stock at $5 and buy 1 $5 call. Despite not actually possessing any shares, you are still technically ""long"" 100 shares. These are called Synthetic Shares. This *could have* thrown off Short Interest numbers, but it also makes it easier for Shorts to recover/get shares/make margin calls.
3. **Twitter Viking** \- I would bet you my car this guy is fake. Everything about this feels like a persona created to appeal to 25-30yo dudes. An altruistic Powerlifter Billionaire who also wrote all of the commonly used trading algorithms? Sounds like Dan Bilzerian's fantasy LinkedIn.
4. **You can Sell, but not Buy** \- This was shady as fuck. The Brokerages fucked up with how they handled this. Unlikely to be a conspiracy though, just small brokers leveraged to the tits during a retail feeding frenzy. That's the issue with instant deposits - they didn't have the liquidity to keep fronting you autists until your money cleared.
5. **""But they need our shares!""** \- Not any time soon, unless the stock goes back to \~$250 *independent of a squeeze*. Yeah, Melvin and Citron got screwed. They lost money. But they do this for a living, so they just reentered their positions at the top (or bought puts for April). They will end 2021 with a net gain on this.
6. **""But the Squeeze never Squoze! It's only a matter of time!""** \- Maybe, maybe not. There still might be a squeeze, but it will not be the MOASS you're creaming yourselves over. SI is somewhere between 50% and 70%. High, but not the 140% of last month.
7. **""But VW! 2008! $1000/share!!!""** \- First of all, GME gained more *by percent* than VW. Second, that was an Institutional Investor locking up the shares. The rules are different at the BigBoi table. They can see and do things we simply can't.

Please do your own research. FFS even gamblers learn the rules of the games they play.

Disclosure: I no longer have a stake in GME. I exited with a small profit. This is not financial advice, I was dropped on my head as a child.",2021-02-03,251,244
lbzkbi_GME,GME,Reminder - Whether you own GME or not - CHANGE YOUR GODDAMN BROKER,"Hello everyone,

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

lbuhp0_F,F,GME short squeeze what comes next part 2,"**EDIT: Added a warning because people in the comments seem to think I’m trying to manipulate people**

**WARNING: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RISKY PLAY: THERE ARE NO METRICS OR CURRENT DATA TO PROVIDE SOLID DD TO HAVE A MORE “CERTAIN” OUTCOME. WHAT YOU ARE TRULY BETTING ON IS OTHER PEOPLE. I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**

Hello all, 

I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.

**First let's talk about yesterday**

There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).

Another large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.

1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2. They haven't covered yet

I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create ""phantom shares"" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. ""With [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations."" From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.

Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. 

So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.

Now, I'm not saying ""nobody sold"" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. 

Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.

**Today**

So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.

1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.
2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.

Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. 

Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. 

So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. 

My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. 

So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. 

But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.

Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. 

So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.

**So when will this second squeeze happen?**

If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.

**In summary**

I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. 

Positions:

1100 GME @ $16 closed

500 GME @ $20 closed

50 GME @ $120 open

236 GME @ $250 open

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.

Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever. Retail investors have more power than we think.",2021-02-03,21908,3795

lbjzsn_GME,GME,Gamestop Big Picture: Has The Game.. Stopped?,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

So today was rough for those in the GME trade.  I, for example, cracked jokes in the comments to my last post about how my remaining GME holdings went from new Lexus money, through Corolla money, and briefly delved to the depths of used golf cart money.  At one point I mentioned maybe ending up with a Razor scooter in the end, but luckily ended the day with Polaris RZR type money instead.

I wasn't paying attention to the pre-market action, but right the start of normal market hours it looked like an avalanche of panic selling.  Looking back at the chart, seeing the consistent downward march of price, the gap down into early pre-US market, immediate drop at 7am pre-market, it shouldn't have been too surprising.  Likely a number of people who are unable to trade pre-market were just watching their numbers move in the wrong direction for hours before they got the chance to bail, and that's what happened immediately once the option was available.

In my previous post I had identified $150/$148 as what I thought might be the ""retail line of defense"".  Given the immediate open below, there was no solid support or consolidation around any level, though some hyper aggressive buying put the floor in at $74.22 at around 10:45.  I'm honestly not sure what to make of that remarkable move.   Likely it staunched the bleeding somewhat, repairing retail morale temporarily.  Once that parabolic arc slammed into the LULD halt, price action reversed and resumed a steady march downward.

So, where does that leave things at this point?  With respect to a squeeze, which I've been asked about quite a bit over the past few hours, my concern is the unlocking of so much float, given what I have to interpret as heavy panic selling.  As I covered in the Market Mechanics post, locking of liquid float is paramount and today was certainly not a help in that regard.  That being said, as I pointed out in that post, locking up the float gets cheaper at lower prices, so we shall see what happens over the next few days.

So what's next?  I don't know, and no one else does either.  Yes, that tired old answer I give in just about every post.  The thing is, it's true.  The events over the past couple of weeks have certainly reinforced that fact to me.

As with yesterday, I've been variously accused of being a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pumper and dumper, which again I take as indicating a healthy balance.  One thing I promise is that I will call it like I see it, and admit to any mistakes I make.

# Knowledge and Responsibility

Watching events unfold today had me thinking quite a bit.  About the debates across this sub and others, the media, etc.  As I've mentioned previously in comments, my purpose in creating this account was to try to help provide some information, education, and a space for healthy discussion for in particular all of the newer traders that were flocking to this particular trade.  I've been very happy to read the numerous comments and messages from various people who have expressed that they feel they've been able to learn quite a bit in a very compressed timeframe due to the intensity of focus on the situation.

I have been told by some that rather than discuss this trade or the mechanics behind it at all, I should simply flat out tell people to stay away because of the risk, and speak of it no more.  I have to admit, I was conflicted about this, because the risk is very high, as I've always stated.

That being said, I believe that participation in the market is one of the most important rights people should have, and equal participation in the market requires knowledge, transparency, and information.  You are all free to make our own choices.  Whatever others may say, You *will* make your own choices.  At least we can try to help each other make those choices with the best information we have available.

Hah, I managed to keep this post at least a little shorter!  As mentioned previously, I will probably have to keep it that way for a while due to real life responsibility.  Thank you all in advance for the great discussion.

Man, rocket rides can sure be bumpy, but it's been the most interesting week in the market I've ever seen.  Let's see what the day brings!

Good luck in the market!",2021-02-03,1130,876
lblofg_GS,GS,Why $GME is gonna rise.,"It's not rocket science.

Robinhood's imposed buy limits coincide perfectly with $GME's stock plummeting.

If the demand for stock is: buying it > selling it, it rises.

If it's selling it > buying it, it plummets. And $GME is plummeting because of Robinhood's buying restrictions.

The only hurdle right now is Robinhood's decision to limit $GME share purchases. But everyone is either against or on that case ([Sherrod Brown](https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1354881250922819585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354881250922819585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Ted Cruz](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354833603943931905%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Attorney General James](https://twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN/status/1354914072194592776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354914072194592776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [AOC](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1354830697459032066), [Elon Musk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/01/elon-musk-robinhood-clubhouse-gamestop/)).

As long as you don't sell your shares, the sky-fucking-high demand for $GME right NOW is gonna skyrocket its prices—it's garnering worldwide attention.

So hold, even if it's one share. 💎🙌

Edit (Feb 4, 15:19 GMT) : The logic definitely is over simplified, but I wanted to be short and to the point. Couching my point with a bunch of esoteric financial terms is only gonna obscure what I'm trying to say. Robinhood definitely isn't the only reason the share prices are plummeting. I may have come off that way. I acknowledge that plenty of other brokers have placed purchase restrictions as well.

lbzkbi_V,V,Reminder - Whether you own GME or not - CHANGE YOUR GODDAMN BROKER,"Hello everyone,

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

lbv3f6_GME,GME,GME POV: someone who already exited position," 

Constant lurker in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and occasionally [r/ValueInvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/) (weird combo I know).

Wanted to share a quick point of view of someone who got in relatively low (39) and got out in the middle (200, stop loss triggered), that I can feel a lot of people with common sense did the same.

Now I dont want to blame anyone on wsb, im a big fan of some DD there and made some small risky plays with the money I was ready to lose. Originally I got into the GME on the short interest DD, when the stock had some impressive jump but it was clear that there is more room to grow considering original thesis. I was happy with every uptick day considering my total portfolio before this play was 9k CAD (ended up @ 22k CAD after exit). But at some point, as many who's been lurking on WSB I started noticing a lot of new things. First of all enormous growth of the sub, but only in quantity. I've noticed that people will be spamming to the moon, diamond hands and than turn around and start asking questions such as ""Why my stocks dont move on Saturday"", ""How do I sell a stock"" etc. Clearly people got into something they had no idea about, jumping on the hype train, which is extremely risky when you are trying to play in the environment you dont understand.

Second red flag was the famous VW squeeze comparison. Every single down day people will be referring to that down slide of VW right before the squeeze. Now when you see it for the first time it makes sense, but when every single dip is referred to that one moment - it just gets super dumb even for WSB. Even scrolling to yesterday you can find some DDs referring to the dip as a last day to jump on the ship.

One of the most important things that forced me to put a $200 stop loss was the entry of new players. When it was just retail vs hedge funds field, it was decently position in favor of regular investments. Even after media joined it was still a favored fight, with Chamath and Elon and Cuban being pretty vocal in supporting GME holders. Unfortunately when brokerages realized that they can't handle the trades asset requirements (especially RH, where majority of old WSB users and new retails investors are holding their positions) and SEC joined the party with rumors of investigations/suspension of trading I promptly setup my stop loss, guessing the game is over.

Crucial thing to realize in both investing and speculation (like this one) is that uncertainty is bad, especially when its a negative uncertainty, especially wen majority of the retail players involved are newbies. If it was just WSB - they could hold the line no problem, I believe in the guys who can leverage their life savings on 0DTE FDs on some shaky company. But when its moms and grandmas who are investing, any negative news on TV will shake their positions. At the end of the day, their way of thinking (its either lose small now or lose EVERYTHING later).

Last nail in the coffin was the whole religious approach that started over GME. When it was an original play on short interest, with actual DD and projections - everything was civil. As soon as it transformed into ""stick it to the hedges"", ""revenge for '08"" it was over, because emotions is your worst enemy in investing. As soon as you are under emotions, you cant make decisions rationally and you just lose control over your position. You start dreaming about 10k price target, driving your new lambo etc.

End thoughts: I sincerely hope that squeeze happens and other people make money, but imo it got too hot and too public too early for it. Regardless if you invest or speculate - make sure you do your own DD, dont jump on a hype train (especially if you are new) and good luck in the future!",2021-02-03,382,218
larhlw_TMO,TMO,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,271,59
larhlw_XLC,XLC,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,267,59
lb0lol_GME,GME,GME short interest down to 51% from S3 Partners,"Last week, GME holders were clinging to a data analysis by S3 partners that GME short interest was still high, even while other sources were claiming that many shorts had covered. Today S3 partners has updated to confirm that the majority of shorts are now covered. The short squeeze is over.  


[As of Jan 31 Ortex said that the number of shares on loan (a proxy for short interest was 30.28 million compared to 69.75 million shares outstanding and 46.89 in free float.](https://twitter.com/rationalsquad/status/1356083271524888580) Ortex's overall estimates for short positions was at 38 million down from 71 million last Monday. The days to cover had gone down to 1.15.  


Now [S3 partners has updated their data](https://twitter.com/rationalsquad/status/1356645940036304900?s=20) to show that GME is about 51% short.   


Unfortunately many of the GME bag holders are clinging to data from financial sites that only update every two weeks with a two week lag. Plenty of sites still show a high short interest. Some of which them show you that the data is current as of a certain date, many don't. Add this to the long list of reforms that are needed to increase transparency in the markets. Even the data from Ortex and S3 are based on their own fancy methodology, and are just estimates.",2021-02-02,0,57
lautma_SLV,SLV,Did Hedge Funds Manipulate Small Time investors (Reddit/Retail) in Gamestop/Silver Option plays?,"The established wisdom on the recent Short Squeezes is that a bunch of 'happy' Options traders led by Reddit and Social Media (us in other words) :-) created a Retail Swarm and hit the Hedge funds and made a ton of money whilst at the same time sticking up to Wall Street.

Today, Carson Block (who always published his Shorts instead of keeping quiet about them but is now de-leveraging as a result of recent price action), suggests that underlying the recent incredible Stock and Options actions we've all witnessed, retail investors were actual  'set-up' from opposing Hedge Funds (CALLs versus PUTs) using the so called 'retail swarms' as a cover for their pre-meditated price action on the same Options many of us bought and so half of Wall Street actually got rich on this as a result. He's not names the funds yet and it will be hard top prove, but we may just be incidental foot soldiers in a larger (mob?) Hedge fund game . .

In addition and as I forecast, the SEC is now looking at how it can enact new legislation to ensure that  this sort of trading modus operandi can't carry on.

Not good any of it . . Take care out there Mark",2021-02-02,1636,696
larhlw_BNTX,BNTX,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,272,59
lajou0_SLV,SLV,I Posted This in WSB and Got Banned -- READ IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE HOLDING $GME,"GAME (STOP) THEORY: THE FINAL STAGES OF THE MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES (MOASS)

**IF ANYONE CAN POST THIS AS A THREAD PLEASE LET ME KNOW -- MY ATTEMPTS WERE AUTOREMOVED**

Disclaimer: *The below should not be misconstrued as financial advice. The below is simply one person layout the current situation aroung $GME and what is likely to occur in the comoing days. Please do your own DD; there is plenty of it on this subreddit, sort by posts 1 week old or before. $GME is highly volatile and it is absolutely possible that you get dicked over by your broker, the clearinghouses, or the SEC. Be prepared to lose everything you invest in $GME.*


Listen up, retards. Many of you just joined Reddit the past few days and are still teething on the unholy spawn that is the market. You've never lost $10000+ on investing in triple leveraged oil ETNs or purchased FD's with an IV crush so horrific that it went down 50% on a sideways move in one day. In fact, before last week you never even knew what put or call options were and the most investing you've done is take out an $40,000/year student loan from the US govt to spend on four loko and shit weed instead of ECON 101 textbooks. First and foremost, let's get one thing clear:

WE ARE HERE FOR **THE MONEY**.

REPEAT AFTER ME: **WE ARE HERE FOR THE MONEY**. 

Don't let the politicians, clout chasers, and pump and dumpers hijack the narrative. This was never a holy crusade against the hedge funds or market makers, this was about a smart investment that had the potential for 1000-1 returns. If the hedge funds got in our way, it was their own undoing for idiotically shorting a stock 100%. They provided the ammunition, wallstreetbets lit the fuse.
So with that out of the way, let's break down the market mechanics.

As far as I see it, we have three groups of people in this sub right now. 

1. 💎 ""HOLD""ERS. These are the people who bought $GME 1, 6, 12 months ago at $4, $5, $15 a share. These guys will never sell, they've more than likely already sold enough to break-even and are now here along for the MOASS. Ride or die until the end, because they have the best positions and have sharpened their 💎 fucking 👐 on $OILU, $PRPL, $TSLA. These guys have done the work and concluded that the fundamental value of $GME even without a squeeze is somewhere north of $100 due to Ryan Cohen turnaround, positive balance sheet and P/S ratio. I suspect this core is ~10% of current r/WSB based on the subscriber count from Friday 1/22, and somewhere in the area of 10-15 million shares.

2. PUMP AND DUMPERS. These are the 1 day old accounts that post about $NOK, $BB, and $SLV. (I am not including $AMC because they have a legit business case and I am also not including people who have invested in $BB and $NOK based on legitimate DD.) This group is the tik-tokers, the twitter daytraders, who are asking to spread our lines thin because they 1) got in late, 2) are looking to make a quick buck off r/WSBs name, and 3) don't understand the fundamentals of a short squeeze. As of 1/31/2021, $GME is the **ONLY** stock **IN THE MARKET** with a short interest of over 100%, meaning it is realistically the most likely to give us the **MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES** (MOASS). When the going gets tough, these people are the most likely to scramble for the exit, as you can tell by comparing the price action of $NOK and $BB vs $GME into Friday's close.

3. LATE ENTRANTS. You guys are who I am most concerned about. You have the most to lose. You've probably entered at $300 or above on Wednesday or Thursday, because you heard it was a way to *stick it to the banks*. Sorry to say, the banks have been deemed too large to fail after 2008 and will likely last until the end of time. Or at least until the heat death of the universe. Again, repeat after me: **THIS IS ABOUT THE MONEY**. Most of you are very young and are not battle tested. First and foremost, don't bet more than you're okay with losing completely. If you bought $GME at $350 or above and can't stomach a move below $100 (that's a 75% or more loss on your position), then PLEASE CONSIDER SELLING ON MONDAY MORNING. It's infinitely better at this point for you to force shorts to cover at $320 (current price) than $50 (what shorts would love to push the price down to) because you will be helping to give shorts momentum, exactly the ammunition they need to collapse the stock. See Thursday's price action from 1030-1120 for an example of what that could look like. Newbies who haven't entered a position yet, consider buying back in on the next move down. THERE WILL BE ANOTHER SHORT ATTACK, I GUARANTEE IT. Consider entering at a lower price point to 1) stop the bleeding for other $GME holders but most importantly 2) give yourself a better price point. Entering at a better price point has a dual benefit: 1) it ensures that you have less to lose, and 2) your potential earnings are higher. N shares at $100 is better than N/3 shares at $300. **Remember, the name of the game, as has been from the very beginning, is locking the shorts out of the market, buying up enough shares so that they will be forced to cover at a price we name.** Realistically, we can do this if everyone diamond hands, and you'll be more likely to diamond hand through a move back to $50 if your entry point is N shares at $100 than N/3 shares at $300. 

Last thing I want to mention. Shorts likely covered a substantial position on Thursday's monster short ladder but short interest is still over 100% of float. What does that mean? Many new short positions were entered at $300 or thereabouts, meaning the pain will not be felt until they see $GME at $450 or more (50% loss on their position). Be prepared for another power play to collapse the stock, convince paper hands to exit, and crush the good guys. Don't fall for it. As long as we stay strong, we'll reach valhalla together. To Neptune, retards.

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

lb9j2l_SLV,SLV,Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS),"Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

lb1x11_SQ,SQ,"A GME fool: I'm hoping to get advice on more realistic stocks I've been researching (AAPL, NVAX, SQ, FUBO, VET) as well as just general tips","Sorry, this is a looonngg post and there are definitely parts you don't need to read like the intro and the NVAX. I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.

So to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.

I'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.

These are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:

**NVAX:**

Currently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.


**AAPL:**

This is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.

**FUBO:**

This seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.

**SQ**:

There was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.

This is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years £400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.

EDIT: Just wanted to update this with; I have been looking through Investopedia University, Khan Academy and have started reading Intelligent Investor. I just want to hopefully make it clear that on top of this post I am doing my own research and I hope people know that I'm not trying to just copy their decisions without any thought.

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

lautma_GME,GME,Did Hedge Funds Manipulate Small Time investors (Reddit/Retail) in Gamestop/Silver Option plays?,"The established wisdom on the recent Short Squeezes is that a bunch of 'happy' Options traders led by Reddit and Social Media (us in other words) :-) created a Retail Swarm and hit the Hedge funds and made a ton of money whilst at the same time sticking up to Wall Street.

Today, Carson Block (who always published his Shorts instead of keeping quiet about them but is now de-leveraging as a result of recent price action), suggests that underlying the recent incredible Stock and Options actions we've all witnessed, retail investors were actual  'set-up' from opposing Hedge Funds (CALLs versus PUTs) using the so called 'retail swarms' as a cover for their pre-meditated price action on the same Options many of us bought and so half of Wall Street actually got rich on this as a result. He's not names the funds yet and it will be hard top prove, but we may just be incidental foot soldiers in a larger (mob?) Hedge fund game . .

In addition and as I forecast, the SEC is now looking at how it can enact new legislation to ensure that  this sort of trading modus operandi can't carry on.

larhlw_BHP,BHP,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY

    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,266,59
larhlw_XLK,XLK,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,268,59

larhlw_SPG,SPG,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,267,59

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

larhlw_ANET,ANET,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,270,59

larhlw_VTI,VTI,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,271,59
larhlw_NOC,NOC,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,267,59
lautma_DE,DE,Did Hedge Funds Manipulate Small Time investors (Reddit/Retail) in Gamestop/Silver Option plays?,"The established wisdom on the recent Short Squeezes is that a bunch of 'happy' Options traders led by Reddit and Social Media (us in other words) :-) created a Retail Swarm and hit the Hedge funds and made a ton of money whilst at the same time sticking up to Wall Street.

Today, Carson Block (who always published his Shorts instead of keeping quiet about them but is now de-leveraging as a result of recent price action), suggests that underlying the recent incredible Stock and Options actions we've all witnessed, retail investors were actual  'set-up' from opposing Hedge Funds (CALLs versus PUTs) using the so called 'retail swarms' as a cover for their pre-meditated price action on the same Options many of us bought and so half of Wall Street actually got rich on this as a result. He's not names the funds yet and it will be hard top prove, but we may just be incidental foot soldiers in a larger (mob?) Hedge fund game . .

In addition and as I forecast, the SEC is now looking at how it can enact new legislation to ensure that  this sort of trading modus operandi can't carry on.

Not good any of it . . Take care out there Mark",2021-02-02,1642,696

larhlw_SWKS,SWKS,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,266,59
larhlw_MRVL,MRVL,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,271,59

larhlw_XLV,XLV,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02,266,59
lb75p7_GME,GME,Seems GAXY is held down by the fixers—using auto trades. Note the straight lines on the graph? (Human orders are not this linear). Volume over 27 million today. Revenues increasing. All-star COO hired. Looks Undervalued. Time to buy in now and break the stranglehold? #GME 2.0? To the moon!,,2021-02-02,1,0
ladv7v_DNA,DNA,GME will squeeze and here's the 10 reasons why I think so + rabbit-hole reading,"TL:DR 💎🙌 = 🦍🚀but read anyways.

My monkey brain has been reading wsb far to long and I decided to put together a quick list of reasons why I think the squeeze will happen (or not, fuck you I lick doors), I sourced everything so that if you learn to read in the next little while you can give it a shot with those. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

A) GME has been on the NYSE Threshold Securities List for over 35 days.  The streak of FTD (Failure to deliver) of shares continues. Where are the shares?

B) The last 3 trading days have had abnormally low volume. It's not coincidental that when the sentiment for $GME is at its all time high and price mooning, trading is/was being suppressed.  Last week was an obvious attack on retail investors ability to purchase shares and gatekeeping from upward momentum. An obvious tell that they would and did incur massive losses.

* Sentiment: [https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment)

C) Since then we've seen Short Ladder attacks everyday to force stop losses and paper hands in order to cover as much as they can. We saw on full display the perversion of MM's/HF's trying to fuck the average joe for their negligent behavior. We've recovered every time. This is an orchestrated attack. This could of ended long ago if they just covered.

D) Brokers no longer have shares to borrow for short sale.

E) Speculation that the shorts have been trading counterfeit shares, this isn't a unique situation and I wouldn't be surprised is this is happening. They could be trying to cover their tracks of this as well as prevent catastrophic losses.

F) The losses incurred should strengthen your convictions about the thesis of $GME.  Melvin needed to be bailed out, RH CEO lied publicly about liquidity and required a bailout today. I'm sure more will also be taking further losses in the days/weeks ahead. HOLD STRONG, they are trying to bait you through volatility, disinformation  and attrition/fatigue. We are gamers HOLD STRONG, consider this a time-gated mission before getting your legendary weapon.

G) The aggressive and blatant ramp-up of disinformation through media is immensely revealing. The billionaires are scared and getting their stooges to throw all the FUD at the wall to see what sticks, to ensure we don't hit the ""grand slam"" as Cramer put it. They are shilling silver (perfectr example), stating arrogantly that reddit is in on silver while out of GameStop ,or both (the swaggystocks sentiment tracker shows the complete opposite) and finally of course saying last week that the shorts are covering. Today's media was down right egregiously incorrect.

H) A large amount of January 29, 2020 calls (strike 115-325) finished itm. These shares will require fulfillment by tomorrow. This is a huge amount of obligated buying pressure.

I) Bloomberg terminal still showing over 120% SI. However there will be a clearer update of the short interest in the coming few days. I want to say the date is Feb. 9, 2020.  IMO shorts have not covered.

J) FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE GME. NOTHING ELSE REPLICATES THE CONDITIONS. I LIKE THE STOCK AND RYAN COHEN. FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE GME WILL REPLICATE CHEWY.  ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET BUT I'M HOLDING. THIS IS A WAR, WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED THAN THEY CAN REMAIN SOLVENT BUT THAT STILL MEANS IT TAKES TIME. DONT BE PAPER HANDED AND STAY RESOLUTE.

I believe that these 10 factors are converging and I'm holding.

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>  
>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
>  
>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
>  
>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
>  
>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
>  
>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
>  
>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*

>  
>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*

>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

l97ykd_V,V,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

l98jee_F,F,GME end financial culture: how this meme is becoming a serious thing,"It is the first time that the financial market is being used against the same monsters who bet on the failures of companies and enjoy manipulating the markets and impoverishing investors.

At least, it is the first time it is happening in front of my eyes and I can actively be part of it.

What is happening has become very serious, but it is experienced with that romanticism and irony that is not often seen in the world of the stock market.

The thing that no one mentions, however, is the incredible contribution that the GME affair is making to global financial culture. Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what's going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.

The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.

This wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.

In short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.

This meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that's hitting us is giving.

This, ~~gentlemen,~~ ladies and gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up. And each one of you is a part of it. And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say ""f\*\*k money, that time we were the protagonists"".

Be honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?

This is why what is happening is not a meme anymore. The world will be different afterwards.

**tl;dr**

The GME Affair is changing the world's financial culture forever. No more financial ignorance, no more ""under the mattress"" investments. No more underhanded economic power plays.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).

Hope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday",2021-01-31,6465,1400

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).

Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose.

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

**Anatomy Of A Short Attack**

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

-----------------------------------

**Typical tactics include the following:**


**Flooding the offer side of the board**

Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. **They will do what has been called a short down ladder.** It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

**By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.** If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

-----------------------------------

**Media Assault**

**The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.**

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

-----------------------------------

**Pulling margin from long customers**

**The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.**

-----------------------------------

**Paid bashers**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

-----------------------------------

**Analyst Reports**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

-----------------------------------

**Planting moles in target companies**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

-----------------------------------

**Frivolous SEC investigations**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

-----------------------------------

**Class Action lawsuits**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

-----------------------------------

**Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.**

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

l9chts_COP,COP,Prisoner's Dilemma - Hold $GME,"This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.

Earlier today I [tried to debunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.

Then I read this awesome post about how [we're being manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from all sides.

This made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we've already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, not everyone will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we're just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. We need them to know why this time.

Enter the $GME [prisoner's dilemma game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Here's the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.

The only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won't) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best outcome is if they HOLD $GME 🚀.

The Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other. That's the mathematical equilibrium/outcome. However, I'm arguing that we've demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We're using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We're maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.

TLDR: HOLD

I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees.

I thought making 5.2M on mattress stocks was amazing, but 50M on Gamestop is freaking Godtism.

Second of all, this volatility in the market is once again creating a good opportunity for selling some high premium puts on your favorite stocks. Currently I am not in these positions, with exception to PRPL and DKNG because I believe the red might continue into Monday.

PLTR- PLTR has enjoyed a nice run up and currently you can sell weeklies that give you about 5% downside protection and will allow you to buy the stock for around 33.00 dollars if assigned. If you go two weeks out then the premiums are even better. I selected a couple of the ones I'd consider selling.  This stock is winning lots of government contracts and recently just signed a large deal with Rio tinto Mining (Go SLV gang). Selling 34.00 - 35.00 puts for 1 or 2 weeks out look nice.

&#x200B;

[PLTR Puts](https://preview.redd.it/rvaqjq9awee61.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9206bbdfcecc081900adaa3e97b644a0dba2716e)

&#x200B;

You all know the story with purple. I just wanted to reiterate, PRPL hit 41.00 on Monday and has been a victim of the mass sell off with no news. I expect a business update soon and I believe earnings and guidance will be excellent. For those with big balls, 40,s 35's are good plays, for those with small little baby balls, 30's are a good play.

&#x200B;

SKLZ- take advantage of the huge Igaming surge. SKLZ is being bought up like crazy by Big Dick Cathie Woods. Selling 30's for big ballers and 25's for small ballers.

[SKLZ Feb Puts](https://preview.redd.it/y3y76q9awee61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=addd02c6e8d67818809d9e38011af4e6da248c40)

DKNG- They just recently released numbers and they beat expectations but fell afterwards. They are on their way back and they grew revenue like mad through the pandemic with most sports shut down. The spending on the Mcgregor fight might also be a good money maker for Q1. I like the 53.00 weeklies for next week or 2 weeks out. 55.00 for the big ballers and 57.00 for huge ballers.

[DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/ssesa0aawee61.jpg?width=898&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64a08b43c9ec83646ed9ed2f5716b3a10ddb6d7c)

GME- I am not in GME gang, but as you know, the premiums are huge. Selling weeklies @ 150 strikes gives you nearly 205.00 of downside protection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a capital intensive play, so tread lightly.

l8nvir_DE,DE,GME Short Squeeze: Act II,"Good day, fellow retards.  We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It’s apparent by now that it’s not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they’re going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.

&#x200B;

For a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:

\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.

\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions

\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.

\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.

&#x200B;

We held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.

Melvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it’s very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they’ve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.

If GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.

&#x200B;

How can we know this is likely true?:

\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering

\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above

\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.

\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they’ll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.

&#x200B;

So basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn’t cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it’s costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.

TLDR:  💎 🙌 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Wow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.

For this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.

Some of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.

I realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!

If any of you reading this are chart jockeys, please share some tips if you have them.

# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest

First, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.

If any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.

A few things to note:

1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27
2. Volume is shrinking
3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high

# Overview - Daily Chart & Summary of the Week

A few things going on here

1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.
2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.
3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.
4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.
5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.
6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.

# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly

Just a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:

1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading
2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.
3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.
4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).

# Technical Analysis - 1/28 to 1/29 Fibonacci Retracement

For those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call ""technical analysis"", it's really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines, bars, etc. on charts to try to figure out what's going on.

One particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement.  It sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it is extremely useful, and extremely commonly used by momentum traders (which is partly why it's useful--if everyone is trading off of the same thing, it's a self-reinforcing bias in the market).  There is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic--I recommend it.  You'll be a better trader and even investor for it, as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts.  Kind of uncanny really.

Looking at this chart I realize I probably should have plotted the 'retail line of defense' here too.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Takeaways:

1. I figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume.  That happened to be the top to bottom move on the Robin Hood news.
2. Using that for the fibonacci retracement, you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the 50% - 61.8% channel in after hours trading.
3. it's quite possible that short-term equilibrium on this battleground stock is $300 to $350 until either side makes a strong push.  Price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume.
4. Probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement (or something very similar) for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense.  In all honesty it's hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook, making it self-reinforcing.  All that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it.
5. Below the price graph, pay attention to the volume bars below.  It's especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price, as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship.  For example, when price is moving around a lot, is it doing so on high volume or not much volume?
6. Traders tend to overshoot a little on each push, so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike, if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push, that actually tells you that it's likely to go higher a little later on.  There are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing (patterns, volume and price analysis, etc.), and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live.

Lots more going on here, but this post is getting pretty long already.

# Other Takeaways

* The whales in the pond obviously do their homework (that's how they got to be that big, after all), and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload 17 million shares at the upper end of the trading range when Melvin got blown up.  That's how you make big bank on big volume--do your homework.
* My thesis in the [part 2 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) that the big early drop before retail pre-market was a short-side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong.  You could make a case either way that it was a new short-side player diving in at a higher price point, a  long-side whale making bank, or a combo of both.  if you check the Ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate.  If so, apologies to the CNBC Squawk Box crew--probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting (though the tone did make a lot of retail panic)
* Ironically, it might very well have been the continued unwinding of Melvin's short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long-side heavy hitter.  LOL.
* Thursday afternoon and Friday were low volume, low-conviction momentum sloshing around.  Dueling HFT algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess.
* Contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week, so I'm not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful.
* I'm sure if I go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully I'll find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts.  It's key when trading, at least in my opinion, that you are willing, able, and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions, no matter how much you liked them. Challenge and verify with data whenever possible.  Not doing that is how Melvin got blown up, after all.
* My worst case scenario thesis in the [part 3 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into GME at these newer highs.  I remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting GME at the $400 as a stabilization mechanism.  Wow.. short something with the most hyper volatility of any $1bn+ stock I've ever heard of... for stability.  That's not a word I'd ever associate with a WSB meme momentum rollercoaster stock.
* An infinity squeeze is still totally on the table, as long as sufficient short interest remains.  The strategy and tactics you'd use to get there may have to be different though, as price ratchets up into higher bands. I'll keep those thoughts to myself--for sure those WSB guys have a plan.  They've proven to be scary effective so far after all.

There are other things you can take away, or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to.  Hopefully, for you newer traders I've given you a useful glimpse into how I might try to use readily available data to improve/challenge/refine a working thesis to ensure I'm better prepared for the days ahead.  You should find the tools that seem to work best for you.

Hope you all have a good weekend.  See you on the field on Monday.",2021-01-30,4900,1249
l8rhr3_V,V,Weekend GME Thread + Homework for all: Let's stop using brokerages that halted trading,"Hello all,

Let's use this thread to discuss the GameStop situation this weekend, please don't open new threads about it unless it is a unique perspective or brings very valuable information.

Do note, posts and comments are still restricted to users with a higher Karma and account age.

##Important information

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

We might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.

I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Wow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.

For this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.

Some of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.

I realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!

# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest

First, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.

If any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.

A few things to note:

1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27
2. Volume is shrinking
3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high

# Overview - Daily Chart & Summary of the Week

A few things going on here

1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.
2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.
3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.
4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.
5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.
6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.

# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly

Just a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:

1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading
2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.
3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.
4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).

# Technical Analysis - 1/28 to 1/29 Fibonacci Retracement

For those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call ""technical analysis"", it's really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines, bars, etc. on charts to try to figure out what's going on.

One particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement.  It sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it is extremely useful, and extremely commonly used by momentum traders (which is partly why it's useful--if everyone is trading off of the same thing, it's a self-reinforcing bias in the market).  There is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic--I recommend it.  You'll be a better trader and even investor for it, as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts.  Kind of uncanny really.

Looking at this chart I realize I probably should have plotted the 'retail line of defense' here too.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Takeaways:

1. I figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume.  That happened to be the top to bottom move on the Robin Hood news.
2. Using that for the fibonacci retracement, you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the 50% - 61.8% channel in after hours trading.
3. it's quite possible that short-term equilibrium on this battleground stock is $300 to $350 until either side makes a strong push.  Price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume.
4. Probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement (or something very similar) for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense.  In all honesty it's hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook, making it self-reinforcing.  All that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it.
5. Below the price graph, pay attention to the volume bars below.  It's especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price, as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship.  For example, when price is moving around a lot, is it doing so on high volume or not much volume?
6. Traders tend to overshoot a little on each push, so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike, if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push, that actually tells you that it's likely to go higher a little later on.  There are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing (patterns, volume and price analysis, etc.), and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live.

Lots more going on here, but this post is getting pretty long already.

# Other Takeaways

* The whales in the pond obviously do their homework (that's how they got to be that big, after all), and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload 17 million shares at the upper end of the trading range when Melvin got blown up.  That's how you make big bank on big volume--do your homework.
* My thesis in the [part 2 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) that the big early drop before retail pre-market was a short-side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong.  You could make a case either way that it was a new short-side player diving in at a higher price point, a  long-side whale making bank, or a combo of both.  if you check the Ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate.  If so, apologies to the CNBC Squawk Box crew--probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting (though the tone did make a lot of retail panic)
* Ironically, it might very well have been the continued unwinding of Melvin's short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long-side heavy hitter.  LOL.
* Thursday afternoon and Friday were low volume, low-conviction momentum sloshing around.  Dueling HFT algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess.
* Contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week, so I'm not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful.
* I'm sure if I go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully I'll find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts.  It's key when trading, at least in my opinion, that you are willing, able, and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions, no matter how much you liked them. Challenge and verify with data whenever possible.  Not doing that is how Melvin got blown up, after all.
* My worst case scenario thesis in the [part 3 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into GME at these newer highs.  I remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting GME at the $400 as a stabilization mechanism.  Wow.. short something with the most hyper volatility of any $1bn+ stock I've ever heard of... for stability.  That's not a word I'd ever associate with a WSB meme momentum rollercoaster stock.
* An infinity squeeze is still totally on the table, as long as sufficient short interest remains.  The strategy and tactics you'd use to get there may have to be different though, as price ratchets up into higher bands. I'll keep those thoughts to myself--for sure those WSB guys have a plan.  They've proven to be scary effective so far after all.

There are other things you can take away, or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to.  Hopefully, for you newer traders I've given you a useful glimpse into how I might try to use readily available data to improve/challenge/refine a working thesis to ensure I'm better prepared for the days ahead.  You should find the tools that seem to work best for you.

l8fcbm_GME,GME,An Oversimplified Look at the GME Situation,"If you are still trying to puzzle out what's going on with GME, try thinking about it this way:

When the Harry Potter books first came out, there was a lot of demand. It might have been profitable to borrow a copy from the public library and sell it on eBay. Sure, you now owed a copy to the library and they were charging you late fees; but you just made $50 and eventually you'd pick up a used copy for $5 once the hype died down and you'd finish miles ahead. Unless something crazy happened like every copy of the Harry Potter books being sold out for months and all the used ones going for more than you sold your library book for. Then you'd be watching the cost of the books keep rising and you'd be accumulating late fees to boot. And since people were still wanting to read the book, the library would have to buy a replacement for the book you hadn't returned while they waited for you to return it. Now imagine that happening on a massive scale, creating tons of demand with limited supply. That is what is happening with GME. The short sellers haven't returned their library books yet and they are paying more and more late fees while they wait for the price of replacement books to come back down. Except the price won't come down and eventually they'll have to start buying books at market price or the cost of the late fees and the opportunity cost of having their resources set aside for replacing library books will make their losses even worse. This will cause more demand, increasing the price of the books, creating even more urgency for degenerate borrows to cut their losses and move on.

Even better, the borrowers are currently committed to returning more books that are actually available to be bought at any price and the publisher is not printing any more.

That is why holding the stock makes sense.",2021-01-30,795,207
l8yamo_GME,GME,Buying GME is NOT screwing Wall Street - It is giving them your money,"As a veteran of WallStreetBets - [made a ‘modest’ $2.5 million there a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/80e7x2/the_big_long_made_25_million_in_january_off_100k/) \- I decided to post this here instead of WSB because there’s no chance anyone there would listen.

I know this won’t be well received, but I’m concerned for a lot of people who’ve been buying GME stock thinking they’re somehow taking on Wall Street. To be fair, those who were early to the trade actually did hurt a couple hedge funds, but the people who followed changed the dynamic considerably.

I know you guys all want to stick it to the man. Unfortunately, you’ve created a situation where the man is going to screw you, hard.

What’s one thing hedge funds do that lead to this?

They find stocks that are overvalued, short them, and then wait.

What have you all done?

Created a horrifically overvalued stock.

Why do you think the short ratio is still more than 100% of the float?

Who do you think’s been selling you GME at $300 a share?

The guys who are going to buy it back from you in a month for $30. They have deeper pockets and more margin than Citron, and are perfectly content to wait you out, whether it’s next week or next year.

*To be clear, I have no skin in this game in either direction, though if I could stomach taking your life savings, I'd be one of the people selling you GME for $300.*

All this talk about retail investors screwing over hedge funds - you are literally giving those hedge funds all your money. People have leveraged their entire life savings to buy an overvalued stock. You are not beating Wall Street. This is their game. You are giving them your money.

Yes, it was funny, and Citron and Melvin took a hit on their initial trades. But now it’s open season on everyone who bought in. At the end of the day, you grossly overpaid for shares of a struggling retail company. That is what you now own.

How do you unwind this position? Is everyone going to hold until they die? What happens if GameStop, like so many other retail chains, goes bankrupt in a couple years, wiping out all the shareholders?

Even if you hold, you’ll be wiped out long before then. **At these price levels, GameStop’s leadership has a fiscal obligation to start diluting their stock as soon as legally possible.** It won’t matter if everyone holds if there’s suddenly 300% more shares available.

In the short term, the price could definitely go higher if retail investors have money to keep buying. So what happens if you manage to push it to $500, or $1000? Wall Street will be thrilled to keep selling you more shorted stock just like GameStop will be thrilled to keep printing it.

There is no way for everyone to unload their positions without losing massive amounts of money. There is no way for everyone to hold their positions without losing massive amounts of money.

You are playing Wall Street’s game and they are happy to take your money. This is going to end badly and is going to hurt a lot of people who can least afford it.  

Congrats to everyone who made a killing with buying options early - even though they used the rest of you to inflate the stock price. But for everyone holding the stock - I wish you the best luck.",2021-01-30,290,676

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.

Wow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.

For this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.

Some of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.

I realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!

# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest

First, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.

If any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.

A few things to note:

1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27
2. Volume is shrinking
3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high

# Overview - Daily Chart & Summary of the Week

A few things going on here

1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.
2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.
3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.
4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.
5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.
6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.

# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly

Just a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:

1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading
2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.
3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.
4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).

Some more about the 'Healthier Choices Managment Corp (HCMC)' company:

Directly from the companys website- ([http://www.healthiercmc.com/](http://www.healthiercmc.com/));

* HCMC owns both Ada's Natural Market and three (3) Paradise Health & Nutrition locations in the greater Melbourne, FL area.
* 'Healthier Choices Management Corp., through its nine (9) owned vape stores across the southeast United States'  #  *Operating  regionally, through its Vape Store store brands, including The  Vape  Store, Vapor Max, Vulcan Vape, and The Grab Bag locations.*

*\*Alot of information below was gathered at the end of 2020, direct saled accuracies very. ¬*

For those wanting to know more about what is going on in more detail:

'Phillip-Morris'  has sold in great excess of 16.4 million units globally of their 'IQOS'  - (E Cigarette technology) system that was designed using patented  technology owned by HCMC.

Not  surprising this has been a hugely profitable scheme from Phillip-Morris  as how many units were sold, highly suspected to the trend of which was  caused by the global pandemic leading people to seek E-Cigarette's as an  alternative.

Further more a quote from this article by [NASDAQ.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \- ( [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-rrps-growth-keep-driving-philip-morris-pm-in-2021-2020-12-28](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-rrps-growth-keep-driving-philip-morris-pm-in-2021-2020-12-28) )  explains what Phillips-Morris intentions were with the 'IQOS' system:

>uity Research                     [Zacks               ](https://www.nasdaq.com/publishers/zacks)Published Dec 28, 2020 9:08AM EST  
Tobacco  companies have  long been struggling with declining cigarette sales,  thanks to  consumers’ rising health consciousness as well as strict  marketing and  manufacturing policies imposed by regulatory authorities.  Amid such a  scenario, industry players like **Philip Morris International Inc.** [PM](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pm)   are managing to stay afloat on the back of growth in low-risk tobacco   alternatives. Additionally, gains from effective pricing strategies  have  been an upside. Let’s take a closer look.  
RRPs Are a Key Growth Catalyst  
Philip  Morris is committed  toward developing a smoke-free future by expanding  offerings in the  reduced-risk products (RRPs) category. These  products, owing to their  beneficial claims, are largely being accepted  by individuals trying to  quit or reduce cigarette consumption. Philip  Morris is one of the  industry pioneers in driving the shift from  cigarettes to RRPs. The  company’s IQOS is one of the leading RRPs in  the industry. IQOS was  launched in the United States in 2019, through a  commercial deal with **Altria Group, Inc.** [MO](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mo)   that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We   note that IQOS is currently the only heat-not-burn product in the U.S.   market, which has been approved by the FDA.  
Since  the onset of the pandemic, the switch from smoking cigarettes to  RRPs  has been trending positively. Total users of IQOS at the end of   third-quarter 2020 were estimated to be about 16.4 million globally. In   the said quarter, revenues in the RRPs category increased 28.6% and   formed a little more than 23% of the company’s top line.  
The   company expects consistent growth in the heated tobacco category, and   therefore has been committed toward expanding these products. Earlier   this month, the company’s IQOS 3 received authorization from the FDA for   sale in the United States. The new device incorporates a number of   technological improvements like enhanced battery life and quicker   recharge. In prior efforts, the company started commercializing IQOS   VEEV, which is its new product in the vapor category. The company also   announced a partnership with South Korea’s KT&G earlier this year to   commercialize the latter’s smoke-free products outside the country.  
Clearly,   such efforts are likely to keep bolstering Philip Morris’ revenues  from  the RRPs space. Markedly, the company is on track to achieve its  2021  goal of 90-100 billion shipments of heated tobacco units. We note  that  other tobacco companies such as **Turning Point Brands, Inc.** [TPB](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tpb) and **British American Tobacco p.l.c.** [BTI](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bti) have been expanding their offerings in the low-risk tobacco space.

It was also expected for  Philip-Morris company to expand due to the 'consistent growth' within  their heated tobacco category- which have made them become committed  towards further expanding and developing these products, which  highlights the success they really had with using the patented  technology, further suggesting how many units were sold.

May  it also be stated that Phillip-Morris has NOT denied this fact with  them revealing their investments in marketing these new E-Cigarettes.

HCMC has issued THREE U.S. Patents in relation to its Q-Cup technology, see here: [*https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/healthier-choices-management-corp-issued-three-u-s-patents-in-relation-to-its-q-cup-technology-1027675756*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/healthier-choices-management-corp-issued-three-u-s-patents-in-relation-to-its-q-cup-technology-1027675756)

[*https://theqcup.com/pages/patents*](https://theqcup.com/pages/patents) \- Directly from their website.

&#x200B;

Also believe HCMC hired COZEN to pursue these claims. - [*https://www.cozen.com/*](https://www.cozen.com/)

&#x200B;

In  the end, what this means is that with all of the units Phillip-Morris  has illegally sold (Including the 100 billion units goal of this year  -2021)- IF FOUND GUILTY and found LIABLE for these patent infringement's  will have ALL profits and related profits related to the IQOS system  FORFEIT - Now becoming owned by HCMC (The patent holder) in some  relating form.

&#x200B;

 All of this paired with the immense amount of money pooled by  Philip-Morris for advisements along with the fact it was approved by the  United States for Large-mass-production by the FDA will only drive more  sales and in return, leaving a bigger price tag for Phillip-Morris to  hand over - ([https://www.pmi.com/media-center/news/the-fda-authorizes-the-sale-of-iqos-3-in-the-us](https://www.pmi.com/media-center/news/the-fda-authorizes-the-sale-of-iqos-3-in-the-us)).

Credit - ( [u/Johnknightone](https://www.reddit.com/u/Johnknightone/) ). 

One of the key points include:

It  is alleged that PM took the technology of Hcmc and produce a  vapor  unit derived from the patent that Hcmc owned. PM began to sell  these **units on the open market and generated 3 billion dollars of sales alone last year**.

> Basically 3 billion dollars was removed from Hcmc through these sales. The vapor unit being sold could not exist and **should not exist for PM**  without  them using Hcmc patent without permission. That three billion  dollars  of sales should have been Hcmc shareholders piece of the pie so  to  speak.

Do your own research, its practically a hidden catalyst, you tell me the odds!

Discuss whats your projections: $1 - More? and what about even after the lawsuit?

I will continue on doing research where I can, developing this post further with information.

l7hnpf_GME,GME,"Actual Reason You can't buy GME, AMC and etc.","Hello Everyone, so first of all, I just listened to the interview that was done by the Webull CEO, which provided a much better explanation on why the stocks are temporarily unable to trade. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM)

The regular trading process:

1. A customer buys a stock/option from a brokerage (which is the platform/customer side of the market)
2. The brokerage sends the information to DTC (basically the custodian and the clearinghouse) DTCC usually requires a collateral of 1-3% of the transaction. This means that if you buy a stock worth $100, your brokerage buys the stock from DTCC for $3 (as a long), since it takes about 1-3 days for the cash to settle.
3. Once the transacation is completed you obtain your shares instantly, but the brokerage will have to send the remaining money 97-99% within 2 business days.

What happened to GME, AMC, and etc.

1. The trade volume skyrocketed and volatility skyrocketed.
2. DTCC became scared and raised the collateral requirement to 100%, basically 33x the capital to DTCC.
3. Assuming the trade volume as of 1/28/2021, 177.8 million shares, that means that the brokerage must now send hundreds of billions of dollars to DTCC every single large trades. DTCC does not have the capital to support it. Melvin Capital does not have the capital to support this.
4. What happens when Melvin Capital goes bankrupt and can't pay for the shorts? Answer: DTCC is obligated to pay for it. Basically making DTCC go bankrupt. What happens when DTCC goes bankrupt, that means the entire US stock market trading goes to a standstill. DTCC has a monopoly of 95% of total US stock trading (according to Webull CEO).
5. That doesn't even take into account the options.

What does this mean: the current market system does not allow such a large number of financial transactions to occur in such a short period and time. In addition, there is a conflict of interest, since DTCC does not want Melvin Capital to go completely bankrupt, since then DTCC might go bankrupt.

1st question you might have: Why does DTCC exist? Answer: when you buy a stock, you buy the street price and not the person quoted price. Otherwise, we could see volatility in the 50%+ forever with the transactions of stocks, since buying would raise the price and selling would lower the price even with a small transactions.

2nd question: What would happen if they don't raise collateral cost? In 2008, Lehman Brothers was like DTCC, they did not raise it fast enough. Basically, the hedge funds that used Lehman Brothers could not sell/buy, since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. This causes a complete market breakdown.

3rd question: Why was Robinhood only allowing selling and not buying? Selling does not require collateral, so that would have been fine. Problem is that it only benefits the shirt-sellers, so they probably should have followed Webull and just halted trading completely.

4th question: What is the worst case scenario? GME keeps rising and it takes a hedge fund completely down, say Melvin Capital. Clearing House DTC will now liquidate the backstop, which is an insurance policy Melvin Capital must buy from another bank or investor firm. If the investment firm goes bankrupt, DTC is expected to pay. If DTC also goes bankrupt, most likely it's taxpayers to prevent trading halt.

**TDLR:** WSB + social media + other hedge funds (definitely some players got into this) almost caused the entire US stock market to halt ALL trading, so the clearinghouse basically changed the rules to prevent that from happening. Basically, they sided with the ""suits""/""wallstreet"", since they could have caused a financial meltdown..........LMAO",2021-01-29,132,125
l82y7u_DE,DE,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",2021-01-29,75149,3874

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",2021-01-29,75146,3874

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

Anyway, I apologize, but this post will be very long--there's just a lot to unpack.

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

Anyway, I apologize, but this post will be very long--there's just a lot to unpack.

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|

|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

&#x200B;

**BOOM**

Now it's **EVERYONE's** problem.  [Come at me, Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353886305277472768), **THIS** is **REAL** baller shit.

Now all you gotta do is make all the hysterical retirees watching their IRAs hanging in the balance blame those WSB kids. Hahaha.  Boomers, amirite?  hate when those kids step on their law--I mean IRAs.  GG guys, keep you memes. THAT is how it's done.

Ok, but seriously, I hope that's not how it ends. I guess we just take it day by day at this point.

Apologies for the length.  Good luck in the market!

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

# Euro Market Hours: Retail Euphoria & The Setup

After-hours and Euro market activity rockets the stock in an essentially unbroken streak from \~$146 to $365. GME long social media is going ballistic.

Volume is too low. There is no sell-side pushback. Allowing consolidation at these prices would be a major setback for the short-side, yet they are doing nothing on volume they could easily push back.

I smell a rat. This is too easy.

# 5am Eastern: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)

If you ask most retail market participants about how quants with their algorithms, hedge funds with their trading strategies, sophisticated experienced traders, etc., conduct their operations, you will probably get responses about sophisticated programs and high frequency trading, fundamental analysis, risk hedging strategies, lots of math, etc. That is largely true, but it is critically incomplete. The most successful hedge fund managers also deeply understand that beneath the surface, the primal forces driving markets are fear and greed, and they know how to best leverage information asymmetry to play other investors--and especially retail investors--like fiddles.

As retail sentiment reaches fever pitch, Andrew Ross Sorkin gets a call from Melvin Capital just before the start of CNBC's Squawk Box, by far the most-watched pre-US market show and files a [breaking news alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYBo5teFTU) at the start of the show.

(Paraphrasing) Melvin Capital is out. They didn't go bankrupt but they came close and took a huge loss. Congratulations WSB, you've won and you've burned the house down, and now that the shorts are out this whole thing is going to crash and burn all the retail investors you dragged along with you.

""[Who's going to be left holding the bag](https://youtu.be/1HYBo5teFTU?t=146)?... uh, the thing that concerns me most, at this point, is whether **some of these investors will actually start to get out today**\--they'll look at this and say 'we won the game'--if that's winning, uhh unclear, you know, where the finish line is, uh in that regard, but uh, as much pain as they may have uh, created for Melvin Capital for example, umm, **my-my great anxiety at this point is the number of-of retail investors that have been jumping into this uhh.. in literally the last 24 hours who very well may get hurt, uh, far more, and lose far more than some of the hedge funds that were involved, uh in this**. Um, let's just show you where we are now...""

""**Where are the regulators**.. and is this just the beginning?""

Meanwhile, as if it had been choreographed and rehearsed, the Squawk Box team are outraged--absolutely outraged at what is going on, while a big graphic of GME price crashing off a cliff dominates 2/3 of the screen and social media is flooded with messages and posts skillfully crafted to stoke the fear.

In WSB, other subs, and other social media sites, dozens of bots start posting bogus messages purporting to mock the retail investors with messages like ""Thanks for the free gainz retards!"".

The fear is almost palpable coming through my monitor. People start trying to sell, then start asking why their market sell orders won't go through while they're watching a practically vertical dive on the GME chart next to Joe Kernan as he says ""If you think there's speculation in crypto \[...\] and-and-**now they're looking for the next mark, right**? They'll-they'll find another Gamestop, once they're done with Gamestop, but **in the meantime, there's gonna be BLOOD**"".

Congratulations Squawk Box--you beautifully played your part in engineering peak, nigh-hysterical fear among the less experienced retail investors, and basically shouted ""FIRE!!!"" in the market equivalent of a locked theater. I truly believe your feelings were sincere, and you truly do have concern for the retailers who have been and will be hurt in all of the volatility, but that made your actions all the more effective in driving many try to lock in losses. C'mon, you can do better--I've seen you do good work and am thankful for what you did getting good info out during the peak of the pandemic--please do some investigation before spreading only one side of the narrative handed to you by financially conflicted parties. You have analysts doing your background research--any of them could tell you the short interest in GME would take more than an entire trading day to unwind even if the buy-side of every single transaction that day was to close a short position and no new short positions were initiated. Also, any of them could tell you that it's unlikely Melvin Capital held 100% of all short interest in GME. Melvin leaving is not equal to all shorts being covered--and you didn't even get confirmation that Melvin actually covered! Get them to say it themselves on air rather than carrying their water and letting them ride on your reputation and providing cover from an SEC stock manipulation investigation.

Most retail brokerages don't open pre-market trading until around 7am. All those people could do was watch their positions bleed as GME plummeted over the remainder of the next 2 hours, hitting the floor of $182, nearly 50% down from the peak about 3 minutes before retail brokerages open pre-market trading.

Wow. I have to hand it to the short-side hedge funds. Some of your traders must have studied drama for their undergrad or something--that is almost perfect timing.

Almost, but not quite.

# Pre-Market Tears... of Joy and Relief

The engineered crash was probably intended to run right through the open of retail pre-market, with the idea of getting panicking retail to sell into the low liquidity environment for more violent downward price moves without the benefit of Limit Up/Limit Down halts, causing a stampede for the exits. Man, how many hours did you guys spend thinking this strategy up? I'm honestly impressed.

Two minutes prior to pre-market open, however, some deep conviction, deep pocket players, understanding the market mechanics and fundamentals behind the recent wild ride in GME started raking in the shares at discount prices they probably never thought they'd ever see again during this campaign. I'm sure tears of joy were shed, as they realized floor-to-close of regular trading gains of nearly 100%. Whoever you are, well played.

I would note here that those people could easily have waited for the engineered crash to drain the blood of the fearful retailers who would have punched out, which would have allowed them to lock in greater share volumes at even lower prices, but they stopped the crash early instead. I don't know if that was their intention, but a lot of retail people were probably saved because of that.

With the almost literally last-minute reversal, price rode green candles upward through the retail pre-market open, and many who would have despaired and punched out to lock in losses instead white-knuckled through the chop and held, with very bullish action through to the market open. Those who survived the day--good on you, I know it couldn't have been easy.

# Chamath

Let's let the man [speak for himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYh_mc26SU) (and speak up for retail). Well worth spending 30 minutes to watch if you have the time. I have to give Scott Wapner credit--he asks tough questions and he repeatedly brings on guests that he know will go toe-to-toe with him with the gloves off to ensure that there is a good, vigorous debate representing diverse viewpoints. Be on the right side of history big boy, lol.

Skirmishing continues at lower volume than the last 2 trading days. Bullish patterns everywhere--buying up on high volume, straggling down on low volumes. Liquidity is running out. Short-side is rationing, saving ammo for the end-of-day push.

# Shenanigans, End of Day, More Shenanigans

At various points throughout the day, levers are pulled to flush retail positions out by margin calling profitable accounts across many of the retail brokerage firms, changing margin requirements with no notice.

Short-side attacks coincide with ominous warnings on news media about potential regulator action, short-side touts spreading FUD across mainstream media.

Short-side's rationed insufficient shares to make meaningful progress on the last tick of regular trading. This is key, as prime brokers of highly levered players pay a lot of attention to the status of accounts at the end of regular trading each day.

After hours it looks like more retail traders are dumped out of their profitable portfolios due to margin change requirements--right into the abyss of super-low after-hours volume. Had their brokers at least liquidated their accounts toward the end of the main trading day into meaningful trading volume they would have gotten much better returns. Dumping them into no volume means the last few accounts took massive losses vs mark to end of trading day market price. Thank, you brokerages, for protecting those people from themselves. Hopefully they took lower profits vs being dumped into the red.

Some people see the diving ticker and panic again.

One thing that was particularly irritating to me is that people were all over CNBC multiple times a day, making outrageous claims of how retail traders were slamming risk into the market via leveraged trades even as the retail brokers changed their policies in realtime to disallow use of any margin in accounts holding GME, and dumped those retail traders out of their positions. I knew what kind of volatility to expect, so I had maintained a net cash position in my account ever since buying, just in case something like this happened--thank goodness.

# Technical Analysis for the Day

I wish this sub would allow charts, but I'll describe instead.

On the daily chart, RSI has been in an ascending channel since April '20(!), and rocketed to 98+(!!!) at the end of the trading day. Price is dislocating wildly higher every day for the past 4 days into descending volume.

My read of the chart is that it shows massive buy-side dominance into worsening sell-side weakness and lower liquidity. I read this as mind-meltingly, parabolically bullish, and something that would not be possible if not for the distortion of the supercritical mass of short interest, and I guess this is what a short squeeze looks like when you have access to all the data retail fintech can provide. The technicals tell me to expect massive volatility, but also that this is possibly the most asymmetrical risk environment imaginable.

I feel bad for the retail shorts that I know were out there. I saw a few posts about people taking short positions because Andrew Left got on TV and told them GME is going bankrupt, it's going back to $20, and he's an expert unlike you reddit amateurs, and by the way about 30 other experts followed and backed him up over the past few days. For this reason I'm glad that many of the retail brokerage firms have disallowed shorting GME and other volatile names. I hope they got out before their accounts got obliterated.

# Lessons Learned

I wondered what kind of things you might see when billions of dollars were on the line, and I have to say that the short-side guys know how to go all-in and pull surprise after surprise out of the hat. They are good at manipulating people, letting them build up euphoric feelings only to slam them in the face with nonstop fear. They do it in media, and they do it in sudden price-crushing rushes, slamming the ticker down to try to get weak hands to fold. As I stated earlier, I am trading deep in the money, on capital I can afford to lose, and even I can't avoid feeling it. I honestly don't know how some of you trading on borrowed money meant for next month's rent can handle it.

The short-side players are running out of ammo, but they don't just go toe-to-toe in the market--they'll blanket media and even flood your discord server, message board, and social media with well-coordinated bot attacks. You will face those moments of stark terror--they are good getting people to feel fear. If you're thinking of getting into this trade--please understand that before deciding whether to jump in. You might not think that a stock that's been going basically vertical could leave long-side casualties on the field, but believe it--fear and volatility can get you to zero your account (or worse!) in any environment.

# FAQs from the First Post (comments and messages)

(answers are my opinions only--do not take as financial advice. I've consolidated common themes.)

* **I'm afraid I'm missing out on a unique opportunity to make returns that could change my life trajectory in a positive way. Should I buy in at this point?**

First, each person decides on their own what trades they choose to make. However, I will say this: Fear is giving you this anxiety. Maximum FOMO is when you see green candles going up until the fear makes you punch the buy order in. Maximum despair and fear of life-altering losses hits peak during deep downward price movements, making you punch out to avoid losing your entire position. Fear makes you buy high and sell low. HFT houses are full of algorithms designed to exploit fear through the price movement, and find gaps in your risk mitigation strategy (e.g. stop-loss hunting algorithms, etc.). If fear is driving you to trade, I urge you not to swim in low-liquidity waters with sharks who specifically make their money exploiting fear.

* **I am a regular investor holding broad ETFs or mutual funds for my retirement. I do not actively trade, but I am concerned that what's happening here might impact the broader market, and maybe even my retirement account. Have you thought of that while you're having all this fun? What about systemic risk?**

You may be surprised to hear that I, and likely many others have thought quite a lot about these things. In fact, I hold about 75% of my capital in the same type of boring IRA and 401(k) accounts you're talking about, and I maybe rebalance them a few times a year and don't even check the balances regularly otherwise.

As for what kinds of impacts there may be--in all honestly, no one knows. Specifically, no one knows because no one knows exactly what the levered hedge funds involved hold, how they trade, etc. The massive short interest in GME is basically a deliberately engineered market distortion that is now blowing off, and distortions blowing off are always scary, and can spell financial damage or disaster for the unprepared.

That, however, is part of the market. To paraphrase Dr. King and Keynes, the arc of the market may be long (and longer than you can remain solvent), but it bends toward efficiency, given the right conditions. The US stock market is pretty good in this respect.

Now I won't deny that these hedge funds are run by smart people, but they occasionally get either arrogant or too clever for their own good and get caught. In GME they essentially voluntarily engineered themselves into a short squeeze entirely on their own while no one was even looking. In fact, the only way the trade works is if no one ever finds out and GME quietly goes bankrupt. In the meantime, a legitimate fundamentals-based turnaround story came to light and just lit the fuse. They’re crying now about being cornered, but they walked into that corner themselves, then dug themselves in so deep that the only way out was GME bankruptcy, and sat there for a year just assuming GameStop would go bankrupt while no one was paying attention and they’d take their free money and walk. If this doesn't make sense, and you have a free 20 minutes and tolerance for mild profanity, I suggest you watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4)

Anyway, That being said, market ""corrections"" are aptly named, even if painful, because they are, in essence, corrections of various distortions in the market. The longer they go uncorrected, the harder, faster, and more drastic the move when it does happen--with usually worse consequences (see the 2008 financial crisis, which was a distortion 10+ years in the making before blowing off).

* **It looks like maximum gains on this trade would have started if you bought in at $4. Should I be looking for names at <$4 to find another opportunity like this? I heard some people made a lot of money on Hertz. Is this like Hertz?**

I have no idea. I wasn’t looking at Hertz at the time. Obviously it's different in that GME is not going bankrupt despite what some people on the news might say (honestly, I don't understand their apparent conviction on this given most of them profess to not even know any details about Gamestop).

The sense I get is that some people realized that many stocks had their prices artificially suppressed by the pure panic in the market at the time, and were likely to bounce back. Stocks crushed down to penny stock land could easily bounce back multiple hundreds of percent just by moving back up by $1, and if you had a good reason to think they'd survive, that's a pretty good deep value trade.

Some people seemed to jump on that bandwagon with the mistaken idea that you should basically just scan all stocks for things <$5 today that used to be >$20 or whatever and assume the 90+% drop will result in a bounce off the floor, even if it’s a “dead cat” bounce on the way to $0. DO NOT TRY TO TRADE THIS.

The theory is that a $100 stock that drops to $10 on its way to bankruptcy could bounce back to $15 first—a return of 50% if you time the floor and the bounce perfectly. In practice almost everyone who tries this loses all their money much sooner rather than later.

By the same token, people who “know” a company is heading to bankruptcy get their accounts wiped out when they short something on margin right as it hits a floor on the way down, get margin called on the bounce, and subsequently join the company in insolvency as they end up owing their broker more than they put in. Being right in the end is cold comfort at that point.

* **Could Gamestop just issue shares to bail out the short sellers?**

I guess it could, speaking entirely theoretically. That being said, consider the following:

They’ve already filed to issue $100mio worth of shares, or 500k shares using $200/share as a price assumption. I don’t know if they’ve begun to execute on that.

That was just to give them the runway required to take bankruptcy completely off the table.

As you note, at these prices, using stock to finance a turnaround is absolutely feasible.

There are, however, a few things to consider:

1. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. They need to be able to justify how issuing even more shares is ultimately beneficial for the company and shareholders. “Because our stock price is high right now” is not typically a compelling reason, though maybe these circumstances are an exception to that rule given the extremity of the price.
2. While a healthy balance sheet would be an improvement, debt is usually cheaper than equity when it comes to financing a company’s activities. If they can secure solvency with the $100mio stock issue already authorized, and leverage the healthier balance sheet and insanely improved market cap to instead borrow what they need to restructure, especially in this ultra low interest rate environment, that would be better for the company and shareholders.
3. They can’t just make a snap judgment to do so. It takes time, board approvals, regulatory paperwork that is public, etc. There is a lot of work and potential risk in this process—particularly for this company.
4. Even if they did this, the incredible total volume of short interest being squeezed means that in practice it would be hard for the share issue to change the trajectory of the stock. The main effect might be to terrify some retail longs into bailing out of their position depending on how the news is presented to them.

* **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ securities pricing theory/model means short interest has no impact on a security's price, short positions can be held infinitely so there really is no obligation to cover, so the thesis behind the short squeeze trade is invalid, etc. Mathematically long and short positions are the same thing.**

That may be true in some ideal theory assuming you are trading in some kind of mathematically ideal market using very specific assumptions, but you’re trading in a real market that includes things like counterparty risk, regulatory and contractual limits on ability to borrow (at least in theory--Hello SEC, threshold securities list??), interest cost, etc. that make trading in an real market different. I'll build on Box by saying all models are wrong, but some are useful--*within the bounds of certain assumptions.* The situation playing out now tells you that the short interest of GME is wildly outside the bounds of whatever models the hedge fund people are using to model position risk.

You can, in theory, infinitely roll your debt forward if you can continue to find willing lenders and are ok paying interest forever. Maybe this works out to be mathematically preferable to a squeeze to infinity.

But, step away from pure theory for a moment. We don't even have to look at empirical evidence in real markets. All we need to do is build a stochastic model of an equity market sophisticated enough to model margin limits and dynamic account balances tied to securities being traded as they are in real markets and you’ll see the probability of continuing to carry a short position converges to 0 over time. The only question is which happens first: you cover proactively, the underlying company goes bankrupt (and you cover for $0 less interest paid to borrow the stock), or you’re margin called and forced to cover with potentially unlimited downside. Take bankruptcy off the table as we have in the case of GME and you have one of two choices--get out or eventually get squeezed out. There is no such thing as infinite ability to roll borrowing forward in real markets, and if your risk models assume that I feel sorry for you.

* **Is this illegal? Will the SEC step in somehow?**

I am not a lawyer. I do not give legal advice. And, honestly, I have no idea. I can't think of any securities regulation that at least I may have violated, but I also don't have the ability to lobby the SEC on international news.

* **So what will happen next?**

I don't know, and most likely anyone who tells you they know is kidding themselves. All I see is a good fundamentals-based position I bought into at a reasonable but bullish valuation followed by the most bullish chart I've ever seen from a TA perspective. I have theories, but there are doubtless other people better qualified to opine on that.

All I can say is if you're in the trade, strap in and prepare for a wild ride. If you're watching from the sidelines get out the popcorn. The rate at which liquidity is disappearing means whatever is going to happen will happen soon (assuming the SEC doesn't step in with an extended pause in trading to bail out the hedge funds).

Thank you for reading, and good luck with your trades.

**\*Update from Original Draft, 1/28 Pre-Market\***

We're seeing tons of retail brokerages limit trading on GME to only allow selling, even when current positions and intended trades would be cash only?

Wow, I mean it kind of occurred to me in some sort of theoretical, abstract sense that somehow limiting large swathes of retail to sell-only was actually better than a general 2-way trading suspension, but who knew the short-side people could actually get retail brokers to do something so bonkers??  I guess you really do find a way to try basically anything when you're about to lose that much money.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$45/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

First, thank you everyone for the comments and questions on [my first post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/). Given the traffic and sheer volume of questions, I figured writing another post would be better (and actually something I can manage).

I wanted to focus this post on a few common themes I saw in the comments to the first post, as well as questions people were asking me directly, and related themes I saw on other posts and subs that I believe would be informative for this sub.

First, a simplified recap of the 1/27/2021 trading day as I saw it. The following is my interpretation of events, and may include personal opinions, assumptions, and outright errors. Apologies for the length, but I hope this helps some of the newer traders thinking about jumping into the water with these sharks. I honestly don't think that you should, but you make your own decisions. I'll just try to help provide some information to help if I can.

# Euro Market Hours: Retail Euphoria & The Setup

After-hours and Euro market activity rockets the stock in an essentially unbroken streak from \~$146 to $365. GME long social media is going ballistic.

Volume is too low. There is no sell-side pushback. Allowing consolidation at these prices would be a major setback for the short-side, yet they are doing nothing on volume they could easily push back.

I smell a rat. This is too easy.

# 5am Eastern: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)

If you ask most retail market participants about how quants with their algorithms, hedge funds with their trading strategies, sophisticated experienced traders, etc., conduct their operations, you will probably get responses about sophisticated programs and high frequency trading, fundamental analysis, risk hedging strategies, lots of math, etc. That is largely true, but it is critically incomplete. The most successful hedge fund managers also deeply understand that beneath the surface, the primal forces driving markets are fear and greed, and they know how to best leverage information asymmetry to play other investors--and especially retail investors--like fiddles.

As retail sentiment reaches fever pitch, Andrew Ross Sorkin gets a call from Melvin Capital just before the start of CNBC's Squawk Box, by far the most-watched pre-US market show and files a [breaking news alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYBo5teFTU) at the start of the show.

(Paraphrasing) Melvin Capital is out. They didn't go bankrupt but they came close and took a huge loss. Congratulations WSB, you've won and you've burned the house down, and now that the shorts are out this whole thing is going to crash and burn all the retail investors you dragged along with you.

""[Who's going to be left holding the bag](https://youtu.be/1HYBo5teFTU?t=146)?... uh, the thing that concerns me most, at this point, is whether **some of these investors will actually start to get out today**\--they'll look at this and say 'we won the game'--if that's winning, uhh unclear, you know, where the finish line is, uh in that regard, but uh, as much pain as they may have uh, created for Melvin Capital for example, umm, **my-my great anxiety at this point is the number of-of retail investors that have been jumping into this uhh.. in literally the last 24 hours who very well may get hurt, uh, far more, and lose far more than some of the hedge funds that were involved, uh in this**. Um, let's just show you where we are now...""

""**Where are the regulators**.. and is this just the beginning?""

Meanwhile, as if it had been choreographed and rehearsed, the Squawk Box team are outraged--absolutely outraged at what is going on, while a big graphic of GME price crashing off a cliff dominates 2/3 of the screen and social media is flooded with messages and posts skillfully crafted to stoke the fear.

In WSB, other subs, and other social media sites, dozens of bots start posting bogus messages purporting to mock the retail investors with messages like ""Thanks for the free gainz retards!"".

The fear is almost palpable coming through my monitor. People start trying to sell, then start asking why their market sell orders won't go through while they're watching a practically vertical dive on the GME chart next to Joe Kernan as he says ""If you think there's speculation in crypto \[...\] and-and-**now they're looking for the next mark, right**? They'll-they'll find another Gamestop, once they're done with Gamestop, but **in the meantime, there's gonna be BLOOD**"".

Congratulations Squawk Box--you beautifully played your part in engineering peak, nigh-hysterical fear among the less experienced retail investors, and basically shouted ""FIRE!!!"" in the market equivalent of a locked theater. I truly believe your feelings were sincere, and you truly do have concern for the retailers who have been and will be hurt in all of the volatility, but that made your actions all the more effective in driving many try to lock in losses. C'mon, you can do better--I've seen you do good work and am thankful for what you did getting good info out during the peak of the pandemic--please do some investigation before spreading only one side of the narrative handed to you by financially conflicted parties. You have analysts doing your background research--any of them could tell you the short interest in GME would take more than an entire trading day to unwind even if the buy-side of every single transaction that day was to close a short position and no new short positions were initiated. Also, any of them could tell you that it's unlikely Melvin Capital held 100% of all short interest in GME. Melvin leaving is not equal to all shorts being covered--and you didn't even get confirmation that Melvin actually covered! Get them to say it themselves on air rather than carrying their water and letting them ride on your reputation and providing cover from an SEC stock manipulation investigation.

Most retail brokerages don't open pre-market trading until around 7am. All those people could do was watch their positions bleed as GME plummeted over the remainder of the next 2 hours, hitting the floor of $182, nearly 50% down from the peak about 3 minutes before retail brokerages open pre-market trading.

Wow. I have to hand it to the short-side hedge funds. Some of your traders must have studied drama for their undergrad or something--that is almost perfect timing.

# Pre-Market Tears... of Joy and Relief

The engineered crash was probably intended to run right through the open of retail pre-market, with the idea of getting panicking retail to sell into the low liquidity environment for more violent downward price moves without the benefit of Limit Up/Limit Down halts, causing a stampede for the exits. Man, how many hours did you guys spend thinking this strategy up? I'm honestly impressed.

Now I won't deny that these hedge funds are run by smart people, but they occasionally get either arrogant or too clever for their own good and get caught. In GME they essentially voluntarily engineered themselves into a short squeeze entirely on their own while no one was even looking. In fact, the only way the trade works is if no one ever finds out and GME quietly goes bankrupt. In the meantime, a legitimate fundamentals-based turnaround story came to light and just lit the fuse. They’re crying now about being cornered, but they walked into that corner themselves, then dug themselves in so deep that the only way out was GME bankruptcy, and sat there for a year just assuming GameStop would go bankrupt while no one was paying attention and they’d take their free money and walk. If this doesn't make sense, and you have a free 20 minutes and tolerance for mild profanity, I suggest you watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4)

Anyway, That being said, market ""corrections"" are aptly named, even if painful, because they are, in essence, corrections of various distortions in the market. The longer they go uncorrected, the harder, faster, and more drastic the move when it does happen--with usually worse consequences (see the 2008 financial crisis, which was a distortion 10+ years in the making before blowing off).

* **It looks like maximum gains on this trade would have started if you bought in at $4. Should I be looking for names at <$4 to find another opportunity like this? I heard some people made a lot of money on Hertz. Is this like Hertz?**

I have no idea. I wasn’t looking at Hertz at the time. Obviously it's different in that GME is not going bankrupt despite what some people on the news might say (honestly, I don't understand their apparent conviction on this given most of them profess to not even know any details about Gamestop).

The sense I get is that some people realized that many stocks had their prices artificially suppressed by the pure panic in the market at the time, and were likely to bounce back. Stocks crushed down to penny stock land could easily bounce back multiple hundreds of percent just by moving back up by $1, and if you had a good reason to think they'd survive, that's a pretty good deep value trade.

Some people seemed to jump on that bandwagon with the mistaken idea that you should basically just scan all stocks for things <$5 today that used to be >$20 or whatever and assume the 90+% drop will result in a bounce off the floor, even if it’s a “dead cat” bounce on the way to $0. DO NOT TRY TO TRADE THIS.

The theory is that a $100 stock that drops to $10 on its way to bankruptcy could bounce back to $15 first—a return of 50% if you time the floor and the bounce perfectly. In practice almost everyone who tries this loses all their money much sooner rather than later.

By the same token, people who “know” a company is heading to bankruptcy get their accounts wiped out when they short something on margin right as it hits a floor on the way down, get margin called on the bounce, and subsequently join the company in insolvency as they end up owing their broker more than they put in. Being right in the end is cold comfort at that point.

* **Could Gamestop just issue shares to bail out the short sellers?**

I guess it could, speaking entirely theoretically. That being said, consider the following:

They’ve already filed to issue $100mio worth of shares, or 500k shares using $200/share as a price assumption. I don’t know if they’ve begun to execute on that.

That was just to give them the runway required to take bankruptcy completely off the table.

As you note, at these prices, using stock to finance a turnaround is absolutely feasible.

There are, however, a few things to consider:

1. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. They need to be able to justify how issuing even more shares is ultimately beneficial for the company and shareholders. “Because our stock price is high right now” is not typically a compelling reason, though maybe these circumstances are an exception to that rule given the extremity of the price.
2. While a healthy balance sheet would be an improvement, debt is usually cheaper than equity when it comes to financing a company’s activities. If they can secure solvency with the $100mio stock issue already authorized, and leverage the healthier balance sheet and insanely improved market cap to instead borrow what they need to restructure, especially in this ultra low interest rate environment, that would be better for the company and shareholders.
3. They can’t just make a snap judgment to do so. It takes time, board approvals, regulatory paperwork that is public, etc. There is a lot of work and potential risk in this process—particularly for this company.
4. Even if they did this, the incredible total volume of short interest being squeezed means that in practice it would be hard for the share issue to change the trajectory of the stock. The main effect might be to terrify some retail longs into bailing out of their position depending on how the news is presented to them.

* **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ securities pricing theory/model means short interest has no impact on a security's price, short positions can be held infinitely so there really is no obligation to cover, so the thesis behind the short squeeze trade is invalid, etc. Mathematically long and short positions are the same thing.**

That may be true in some ideal theory assuming you are trading in some kind of mathematically ideal market using very specific assumptions, but you’re trading in a real market that includes things like counterparty risk, regulatory and contractual limits on ability to borrow (at least in theory--Hello SEC, threshold securities list??), interest cost, etc. that make trading in an real market different. I'll build on Box by saying all models are wrong, but some are useful--*within the bounds of certain assumptions.* The situation playing out now tells you that the short interest of GME is wildly outside the bounds of whatever models the hedge fund people are using to model position risk.

You can, in theory, infinitely roll your debt forward if you can continue to find willing lenders and are ok paying interest forever. Maybe this works out to be mathematically preferable to a squeeze to infinity.

But, step away from pure theory for a moment. We don't even have to look at empirical evidence in real markets. All we need to do is build a stochastic model of an equity market sophisticated enough to model margin limits and dynamic account balances tied to securities being traded as they are in real markets and you’ll see the probability of continuing to carry a short position converges to 0 over time. The only question is which happens first: you cover proactively, the underlying company goes bankrupt (and you cover for $0 less interest paid to borrow the stock), or you’re margin called and forced to cover with potentially unlimited downside. Take bankruptcy off the table as we have in the case of GME and you have one of two choices--get out or eventually get squeezed out. There is no such thing as infinite ability to roll borrowing forward in real markets, and if your risk models assume that I feel sorry for you.

* **Is this illegal? Will the SEC step in somehow?**

I am not a lawyer. I do not give legal advice. And, honestly, I have no idea. I can't think of any securities regulation that at least I may have violated, but I also don't have the ability to lobby the SEC on international news.

* **So what will happen next?**

I don't know, and most likely anyone who tells you they know is kidding themselves. All I see is a good fundamentals-based position I bought into at a reasonable but bullish valuation followed by the most bullish chart I've ever seen from a TA perspective. I have theories, but there are doubtless other people better qualified to opine on that.

All I can say is if you're in the trade, strap in and prepare for a wild ride. If you're watching from the sidelines get out the popcorn. The rate at which liquidity is disappearing means whatever is going to happen will happen soon (assuming the SEC doesn't step in with an extended pause in trading to bail out the hedge funds).

Thank you for reading, and good luck with your trades.

**\*Update from Original Draft, 1/28 Pre-Market\***

We're seeing tons of retail brokerages limit trading on GME to only allow selling, even when current positions and intended trades would be cash only?

Wow, I mean it kind of occurred to me in some sort of theoretical, abstract sense that somehow limiting large swathes of retail to sell-only was actually better than a general 2-way trading suspension, but who knew the short-side people could actually get retail brokers to do something so bonkers??  I guess you really do find a way to try basically anything when you're about to lose that much money.

EDIT GUESS THEY""RE NOT IDK THEYRE FUKT THO

&#x200B;

Like many of you I woke up today trying to see if I was gonna hit my second M and was a little shocked at seeing that I couldn't get a bid or ask on any options that I had. I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.

I've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.

Questions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for

1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?
2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?
3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?

I suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.

Look at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.

I made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been\_too\_long\_since\_weve\_had\_a\_bearpocalypse\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been_too_long_since_weve_had_a_bearpocalypse_post/)

Citadel is almost BK and everyone can fucking smell it. We get one last big green on GME IMO and that will be the death kneel of Citadel. I don't know if it happens thursday, or friday, but it's coming. You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them. IF you see market red as shit tomorrow, you buy index puts and puts on whatever Melvin and Citadels longs were and you lean into it because not only is Citadel going to liquidate but the whole market is likely to go with it.

Good luck

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT.

l6kgoi_GME,GME,Gamestop has become a prisoner's dilemma for stock holders,"I'm sure some of you, like me, follow WSB and other places, if for nothing more than entertainment. It got me thinking about Gamestop today. I'm mildly annoyed with myself that I didn't do the legwork to understand it when I looked at it in 2019. Being the lazy person I am I saw eh, weak/negative earnings history, outdated business model, and didn't put any more effort into it. I typically don't pay any attention to short percentages. The concepts in play aren't especially hard to understand, and when at that time it was in the $2-5 range it was not unreasonable to think it had a lot more upside than downside, especially with the console cycle coming, even without the benefit of the short pressure.

I'm not much into these kinda of asymmetric longshots with potentially huge upsides, because they tend to get into distributions, probabilities, long-tails, the weakness in black-scholes, all that jazz. I get it on a macro concept level but my math skills revolt and my brain ends up saying too hard, too easy for you to be wrong, leave it alone. Looking back when Gamestop was at $2 with the balance sheet strength it had left and the amount it was shorted at the time, this was a real wide-margin intelligent speculation. A speculation, but one with heaps of implied upside. Whether I could have held on throughout the unknowns of the pandemic, I don't know. And if congress hadn't acted or the fed acted differently, who knows. The outcome could have been very different.

But now is a very different story. The stock isn't $2 anymore, it's $100 or $200, depending which minute of the day your ticker updates. The proposition has changed, not just for the next speculator looking to buy in, but every earlier speculator who already took a position.

So what's a person to do who did take a flyer and gamble on it, or recognized the opportunity early and levied an intelligent speculation? How do you decide when it's time to cash your golden ticket and call your accountant. This is a classic prisoner's dilemma. Assuming the float reported is still accurate, and there is more than 100% of the outstanding shares sold short, then naked short selling has occurred and the short positions are really in the ditch. Last report I read, shorts borrowed several billion dollars to meet margin requirements and pray the GME holders flinch soon. 

Logically there has to be a ceiling, some price at which the last dollar is be extracted from the richest short seller, after which their lender of last resort has refused, and the bankruptcy's begin. Price appreciation beyond this is simply the greater fool chasing a story. I don't think there's a way to determine this empirically, since even if you could get all the necessary numbers and guarantee they were accurate, and you could nail down appropriate probabilities and the accompanying profit margins from each scenario, this involves not only a lot of human psychology but a good deal of politics, propaganda, lawyerly wrangling and the potential for backroom dealings. Not exactly the stuff of certainty or traditional value investing, but fascinating (to me, at least) as a spectator. This is a prisoner's dilemma.

Every person who now owns GME long is a prisoner, and every short seller is a prison guard. As long as the prisoners stick together, up to the limit of bankrupting the collective short sellers the squeeze should continue and increase the collective payout. But as soon as the guards are able to flip a big enough holder or enough small holders to knock over that first domino, the formula tips and the second domino caves in, and so on down the line. This is the basis of the theory Malcolm Gladwell outlined in The Tipping Point. So each holder has to consider his or her own selfish interest of cashing out now before that occurs, versus the risk/reward of betting that the group isn't going to tip yet and staying in for a greater amount of price pressure upward, hoping they aren't left to catch a falling knife later.

When is it going to tip, at what price, and how much yoyo action might occur in the meantime, before the final short is settled. I wouldn't even pretend to try and model this. That's Nassim Taleb territory, higher probability mathematics. I'd be fascinated to read about it, but not my bag.

It did get me thinking about options. Is there an opportunity to buy a put option cheaply right now, which might possibly be priced very improperly at this moment. I don't know if one month is far enough out, but things seem to be moving reasonably fast now, so perhaps the dust is settled by then. If you could spend cheaply enough to buy a put option to sell at say $50 a month from now would that constitute a intelligent asymmetrical bet? At some point the shorts will either be liquidated or cover, the ""ryan cohen"" die-hard believers may stay for the turn around story, but the price pressure is off and all the gamblers start heading for the exits so they can participate in the next gamble. The prisoner's dilemma domino's will start falling. Even if the price eventually settled higher, the downward swing might very well spike down well below $50, or less, during this time.

Looking at cnbc's put options for Feb and March the answer for me was no. Prices look too high for comfort, a lot of people smarter than me have probably already considered this and driven the price up, perhaps as hedges or speculations in the same vein as outlined above. I don't have the skill to figure out at $7 if a $40 PUT option one month out is an intelligent speculation to pick up, so for me it would still just be gambling. If that same put was 75 cents, I could accept it's likely at least a smart speculation, and if not it's cheap enough to take a flyer on. At $6 to $7 I can't. Long tails and options are a fascinating world. Shame I didn't pay more attention in math class.

Hey, it's your boy ~~Chimpu~~ Tsukune Surprise.

This past weekend I posted some DD on the squeezes.  Yes, fucking plural you illiterate retard.

Many of you messaged me and said you enjoyed it.  Although I'm not sure how many people could actually read it.  I think most of you liked the pretty colors and lines.

I updated my TA for today's market close.  The TA does not include the AH absolute face ripping toboggan ride on your mom's river of squirt.  So whatever is in the document- just add some Peter North ropes of extra Gentleman's Relish (TM) to the top.

I'm still recording the audio book version for those of you busy licking fucking windows.

Here's the summary of what has changed.  Tighten your helmets and bibs.

l5rxsh_MS,MS,GME thoughts from Shkreli - 1/26,"Well, things are evolving, needless to say. I haven't talked to my WS people on the borrow situation. In my day, the best place to short stuff like this was actually the retail brokers, but NO hedge funds prime at these brokers and generally can't access these pools easily. A smart hedge fund has a little money at every broker he can, but it makes accounting and reconciliation a royal pain in the ass. Most hedge funds have 1-4 prime brokers. The very biggest have an account everywhere, but folks keep it centralized. Of course those prime brokers try to go around get 'borrow' for their clients, but typically they need to have someone custodial assets long (someone who owns gamestop) and then the rate is competitive. However, I'm pretty sure RH can give a locate/borrow to someone like Morgan Stanley (who incidentally bought eTrade). The borrow world is extremely opaque. IBKR sources borrows from lots of sources but they're a bit unique. It isn't uncommon from what I'm told for one desk to be paying a 50% fee to the client/lender and charging 75% to the borrower, capturing quite the spread. Back when I was short MNKD, the rate eclipsed 100%. Anyone know where it's at now?
  The next thing I'd say is the Melvin situation is unprecedented. SAC and Citadel have a lot of capital, but in the scheme of things, they're still hedge funds that aren't 10x or 100x bigger than Melvin. Well, there really aren't any hedge funds 10x bigger than Melvin, and the one that does exist (Bridgewater) doesn't get involved in individual stocks. The rest that are close are basically SAC, Citadel, etc, but they're only 2-5x bigger.
  The real question is, is Melvin out or not. My guess is they MUST have made the trade smaller given their losses. If I were Gabe I'd try to work the losses off, take a sort of ""one time charge"" (not really a thing in HFs) and move on. With discounted fees on new money he might survive, despite this being a big risk-management failure, it is quite the black/white swan. But I don't see Citadel/SAC investing knowing this trade is still on. That brings me to the next point.
  Yes, in the long run, I am bearish on GME. That means in 24 months the stock will almost certainly be lower than where it is today. That's what I do. I'm an investor. I've never been a great trader. That's probably because it's very hard to be a great trader. Even the best traders (think Cohen) are right around 55-60% of the time. You have to be nimble and accept losses quickly. Anything can happen here in the short run. Anything. The stock could go to 1,000. It'd be really stupid, but it could happen. I'm sure some of you are familiar with the ""max pain"" theory, that stocks tend to take the path that causes the most pain. That would be it.
  That doesn't mean I anything anyone should be buying GME. This is just the biggest poker game that ever has been played. It's really breathtaking. Longs know what their ultimate fate is, but it is sort of like Wily E Coyote. Whoever blinks first loses. In situations like this, I have found that BOTH sides typically lose. How? The shorts get blown up, obviously. After they get blown away, the greedy longs get blown up. The first-to-the-long guys are usually out pretty quickly (think 4 to 8, I'm done!) and the only ones who win. The first to the short guys typically stop out (idiots) or dig in (bigger idiots). If they dig in they almost never ride it out and get ""bought in"" or lose all their AUM through withdrawals or sometimes ""blow up"" (lose 100%+ of their capital). Blowing up means brokers take a loss, eg their prime broker. If I'm MS (Morgan Stanley) or someone like that, I'd be talking about my risk exposure to this trade lol. It reminds me of the old saying, ""lose $1 million, you have a big problem. lose $100 million, the bank has a big fucking problem."" At some point the chain of custody of the loss passes from LPs to the bank/brokerage. I'm sure some small hedge funds have already been wiped out.
  So, long story short (or short story long?), I still am firmly convinced GME is going nowhere from a fundamental standpoint. There will be no miracle Ryan turnaround that ever makes it worth $100+. But that doesn't mean the stock won't go up today, tomorrow, or even this whole quarter or half of the year or whole year. This is all a crazy Wall Street speculative frenzy and buying begets buying. I think there's a 30% chance it's all over and it goes down quite soon. A 30% chance it goes up, still quite a bit (30-50%) and blows off and then it's all over relatively soon. And then there's a 30% chance it doubles and then drops. And a 10% chance it could go up 10x before it is halted or there is some rule change or it eventually cracks.
  Whatever happens, you all made history. I'm kind of proud and kind of sick. Most importantly, I wish I was long! No position. Asked my people to look into shorting it over the weekend and told them today, yeaaah don't do that. I almost never trade as it's pretty difficult to invest from here and I think this one is probably too tricky to figure out without access to information (borrow movements, fund returns, etc.) If I had access to what all the borrow desks on the street are doing, friends at every fund who is a player in this debacle, returns from the funds themselves, one could kind of map out what is happening. Robin Hood level information would be the best, but clearly no one has that (except for Citadel lol). 
  Good luck to all, be careful (don't have more than half of your money in GME, don't use margin) and I hope you all make a fortune.

l5s9ss_TSLA,TSLA,Curious why Papa Elon is shilling $GME? It’s because Melvin Capital shorted $TSLA for years and bragged about it.,"Elon has battled shorts for almost a decade. We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE: [better source](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/melvin-capital-management-lp) showing Melvin Capital’s puts on TSLA from 2016 through 2020

UPDATE 2: stop giving me silver awards your cheap bastards. Platinum or GTFU.

UPDATE 3: [positions or ban. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5s9ss/curious_why_papa_elon_is_shilling_gme_its_because/gkwauak/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3).

l5ycjl_PLTR,PLTR,"GME bulls: *Brace yourselves* for this inevitable (but necessary) temporary setback, and be ready to take full advantage!","Disclosure: I’m very long GME since 15 (unfortunately mostly vertical debit spreads but I added a lot later at 50). 

I want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. 

So be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: 

Shorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. 

Remember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. 

Side-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. 

This right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. 

So just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀 

TLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.",2021-01-27,1335,344
l61vn2_OXY,OXY,The $GME WSB Movie just got way cooler with a Pepe Silvia Twist & Weird Hostile Takeover Angle? Cramer - Give me a Pulitzer.,"**Put on your tinfoil hat**

Melvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.

**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?

There was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a ""jovial"" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or ""maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts"" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  

This bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a ""billionaire"" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?

Donald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?

[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) 
Gamestop was trading at $34.  

[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)

In the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   
[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)

**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.

In 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  

[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)

Gamestop is now trading at $12

In 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.

**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**
**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**

[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**
[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). 
Gamestop is trading at $4.

[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) 

**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  

In August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*

Everyone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.

TODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.

Why does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!

l5tj1g_GME,GME,Current State of the Market (GME side effects).,"The whole market has been off. Its bullish but off. There are so many new traders on here and i guess stocks is a great hobby especially during this pandemic. Regardless, the sudden increase of GME is making everybody, and there mother open up trading accounts. I feel like shorts are going to get destroyed in the next few days with the influx of people, but then when things get back to normal many average and regular people are gonna get destroyed. Last year at around march when the market was booming the same thing happened and people were minting. But then everything started going down again, until it normalized. But as a person who did really good during that initial bull run, i got destroyed in the red days and still got destroyed when the market returned to normal and thus had to learn some important things in order to somewhat recover and play the game when things arent so crazy. 


 ***Eventually things will start to settle down and People are eventually gonna take profit because no one wants to lose. What goes up can come down***

***Main point was the fundamentals, and if your buying a stock which breaks your fundamentals and you buy just for the hype or social media, i think you should play with the money your willing to risk ""extra cash you have"" because if you do lose you suffer less and it wont affect your health. Probably not a good idea to not sell your house or put in a 100k in your trading account for a stonk.***

Its a bull market so we all can go crazy, short squeez that, this will go to the moon whatever. But I just want to say, set stop losses, have back up plan, never forget the fundamentals, do not FOMO and if your a gambler (which realistically many including myself are) follow the first few points and maybe risk what your okay with losing (i cant speak for the guy who posted hes addicted to losing but i guess if your in that boat, maybe talk to someone....)

There was another post stating that you probably arent a genius if you score 100% this time, and I resonate with that hard because i thought i was last time and back then I had just opened an account. You might be a genius, but maybe. Hopefully I can learn to be that genius, and take advantage when the market is bullish and still win when the market goes red or returns to normal.

Thank you to all the 💎 👐. Thank you $GME. Thank you Papa Cohen and Papa Elon for taking us to tendie land. I love you all and have a good night.

Also I am going to pay it forward and the first person to message me will get dinner on me!

Take care y'all.

l61vn2_AAL,AAL,The $GME WSB Movie just got way cooler with a Pepe Silvia Twist & Weird Hostile Takeover Angle? Cramer - Give me a Pulitzer.,"**Put on your tinfoil hat**

Melvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.

**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?

There was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a ""jovial"" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or ""maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts"" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  

This bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a ""billionaire"" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?

Donald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?

[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) 
Gamestop was trading at $34.  

[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)

In the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   
[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)

**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.

In 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  

[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)
Gamestop is now trading at $18

[On December 31 2018 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $82.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420419007123/tv513133_sc13ga.htm) 
Gamestop is now trading at $12

In 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.

**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**
**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**

[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**
[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). 
Gamestop is trading at $4.

[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) 

**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  

In August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*

Everyone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.

TODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.

Why does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!

TL;DR Did Deepfuckingvalue prevent a 5year vulture capitalism play? WTF?  SEC Give me Award.

l6ccmy_GME,GME,Bloomberg Opinion: GameStop Is Rage Against the Financial Machine,"I know, everyone is tired of hearing about Gamestop, but this was something I came across that I thought was actually quite well written and pretty spot on with most of the anger driven rhetoric I've seen on Reddit.  

I've copy/pasted because I know most of y'all don't have Bloomberg subscriptions.  

> **Traders putting on the short squeeze aren’t motivated by greed. They’re engaged in an anger-driven uprising against the establishment.**

>**Anger Is an Energy**


>The saga of GameStop Corp. continues. By the end of another frenetic day of trading Tuesday, the stock had just topped its high from Monday. Between those peaks, it staged a fall of more than 50% on Monday afternoon. Colleagues have followed these extraordinary developments as they happened. I will try for now simply to process the single most important question: Is this just a weird technical situation, of the kind that comes along every few years, that can otherwise be safely ignored? Or does it tell us something important about market conditions as a whole?

>GameStop's share price surged back to set a new high
Purely qualitatively, based on what I have witnessed, I think it does matter. The signal it sends is disquieting, if not surprising. It also introduces us to a new variant on an ancient market phenomenon.

>The cliche is that market capitalism works on the balance between greed and fear.  The standard defense is as follows: If the greed to make money by beating the competition is matched by a fear of failure through making too many mistakes or cutting corners, then capitalism works. Nothing else yet discovered gives people such an incentive to work and create growth. Speculative bubbles happen when greed becomes excessive, or when fear diminishes too much. Easy money and easier trading with derivatives oil these emotions and allow them to run riot. The financial crisis of 2008 happened in large part because years of policy had convinced investors that there would be a bailout if they failed; they lost their fear, and greed took over. 


>This feeds into the debate over whether we have a speculative bubble at present. Markets are pervaded by gloom and worry, so there is no lack of fear — even if confidence that interest rates will never rise is growing excessive. Meanwhile, there is little in the way of greed. Cryptocurrency has generated excitement, as has Tesla Inc., but in the main the frenzy over a historic opportunity to get rich, of the kind that was everywhere in 1999, is lacking. This is a different, worried world. The last two decades have stripped it of its positivity. The mood is nothing like the great bubbles of the past.

>Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it. 

>On Monday, I argued that it was misplaced to take pleasure at the pain for the short-sellers who had attacked GameStop stock, and then been subjected to a “short squeeze” for the ages by traders coordinating on Reddit. I received a bumper crop of feedback. Here are some representative samples (leaving out many with unprintable expletives):

>>“You kind of miss the point of what is going on with GameStop. How much did Melvin pay you to write this garbage? shill. Literally trying to protect an industry trying to fleece jobs from low income workers. Sleep well chump.” 

>>“Watching entitled institutional shorts whine on TV and OP EDs that millennials equipped with margin accounts & zero fees are collaborating on Reddit to target them is my new favorite sport. Looks perfectly healthy from where I'm sitting, which is on bull side :) plus 1 for the little guys.”

>>“Normal isn't putting the retail trader down for being independent while organized hedge funds force you to take their way or suffer in fear. Normal is the American dream and being able to make your own way. This isn't a casino. This is a riot.”

>One respondent warned that the people squeezing the shorts aren’t “a herd of impressionable youngsters with Robinhood accounts. No. They are an experienced & ruthless army of insomniacs followed by a silent legion of rapidly learning new traders. This is a new paradigm that won’t go away.”

>Another told me I was a “dumb boomer” amid a screed of unprintable epithets. (Point of information: I’m just too young to be a boomer. I’m in Generation X, but it’s the intergenerational antagonism that’s noteworthy.) Another said that the short squeeze was just a way for millennials to recoup the money they had been forced to pay to bankers during the TARP rescue 12 years ago, and to put coronavirus relief checks to work:

>>“In other words, poor people have too much money and are now controlling the narrative. Damn those $1200 stimulus checks and $600 unemployment supplements. Too much liquidity, let's get these folks back to living paycheck to paycheck.”

>>“I know. Democratisation of the market is so damned inconvenient for those of us with money.”

>>“nobody cares about your hedge fund cronies!”

>>“Bloomberg defending the suits. Not surprised. They’re just mad the rubes are in on the joke now. Might this force the Fed’s hand? Too many regular people in on the game.”
 

>This is all fascinating. In the space of 12 years, the role of the short-seller has turned on its head. Back in 2008, it was the shorts who upset the status quo, revealed what was rotten in the state of Wall Street, and brought down the big shots. They were even the heroes of a big movie. It was the Wall Streeters who attacked them.

>Alienation has deepened since then. Short-selling hedge funds are now seen as part of a corrupt establishment, as is the media. The motives of anyone defending the shorts, or anyone wearing a suit, must be suspect. And there is a deep generational divide; those unable to own their own home and forced to rely on defined contribution pensions have a stunningly unfair deal compared to those a generation older, living in mortgage-free homes with guaranteed pensions. That percolates into anger, and a determination to right the scales by making money at the expense of corrupt short-sellers. 

>We lack precedents for an angry bubble, so predictions are even harder than usual. But there are enough similarities with past incidents to raise serious cause for concern.

>First, the little guys have had their success so far with the aid of margin accounts, and by using derivatives. We know what happens when these things are used to excess; even the Dutch tulipmania relied on margin debt and derivatives. Little guys (and everyone else) deserve safer tools with which to build wealth.

>Second, “democratization of finance” isn’t new, and in itself is nothing that anyone can object to. The problem is that investment and financial planning are difficult, and require time. Regulate these things, and you no longer have true democratization. Leave people free to take chances, and you get disasters like the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. That also followed plenty of hype about the success of the “little guy,” and the first great explosion of online discount trading succeeded in sucking an army of new retail investors into the bubble’s final climax. Unregulated “democratization” led to the little guy bearing the brunt of the losses.

>“Democratizing” finance also leaves newly enfranchised financial citizens prey to spivs and frauds. I started my career covering the disastrous repercussions of one of Margaret Thatcher’s last reforms in the U.K. — giving people the right to leave their defined-benefit pensions, offered by employers, and take on defined-contribution “personal pensions.” Unscrupulous salesmen persuaded miners, firefighters and police officers to abandon copper-bottomed index-linked pensions for plans that came burdened with excessive charges. It was a repellent spectacle, and the bill for compensation was in the billions.

>These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.

>Anger, even more than greed, has the capacity to make us throw caution to the winds. Many of us have a lot to be angry about. If this carries on, and spreads beyond targets like a video-game retailer, I don’t want to see the consequences when history’s first angry bubble bursts.

l68ou8_GLD,GLD,SLV and GLD - the next GME?,"I am wondering if the same dynamic that has been working with GME, AMC, etc  would be even more effective with the physical gold and silver ETFs (SLV and GLD).  Here is a tweet from Luke Gromen yesterday:

 https://twitter.com/LukeGromen/status/1354190304325341193?s=20 

A wave of intense buying (both the underlying and OTM Calls) could create a major supply/demand imbalance in the physical market.  This would put pressure on the Swap Dealers, who as of the Jan 19 COT report, were  65,924 (long) vs.  249,901 (short) in the gold market and  30,564 (short) vs. 51,437 (long) in the silver market.  

If a dynamic like this were set in motion, the trade is owning the related gold and silver equities.  A gold spike above $2,100 or a silver spike above $50 would send the related equities to the moon (e.g. Equinox Gold, Pan American Silver, Fortuna Silver).   

I am not sure if mass SIL and GLD buying would have the effect I predict.  But, the gold and silver market is so tight that mass participation could easily send a lot of these stocks soaring.",2021-01-27,349,22
l5ycjl_GME,GME,"GME bulls: *Brace yourselves* for this inevitable (but necessary) temporary setback, and be ready to take full advantage!","Disclosure: I’m very long GME since 15 (unfortunately mostly vertical debit spreads but I added a lot later at 50). 

I want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. 

So be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: 

Shorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. 

Remember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. 

Side-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. 

This right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. 

So just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀

Along with those opportunities has come an influx of hundreds of thousands of subscribers to this sub, over 100k within just the last few days. With those new subscribers comes a slew of charlatans trying to sell shitty investment services/courses, promote their YouTube channels, get you to follow their Twitter, etc. **First, this is a warning that we will ban first and ask questions later for self-promotional posts, anything that is obviously designed to pump low volume stocks or manipulate the market, or in general is just a low effort, shitty post.**

**Second, and more importantly, I see this time period - with a lot of new growth incoming - as a great opportunity to vastly improve the content of this sub.** These shenanigans that have been going on with GameStop are proving to us that there are real opportunities out there, but we need quality content and quality contributions to find them. That means not filling the front page of this sub with bullshit posts that are two sentences long pumping your penny stock that trades 50,000 shares a day. It also means not posting ideas that are solely based around fucking manipulative hedge funds, short sellers, and the like. That's not because we agree with what they do or because we want to promote their ability to continue to screw over retail traders, but because doing this will bring unwanted attention to this community and potentially get us banned from Reddit.

So, sure you can post about stocks that have high short interest and that might present opportunities for short squeezes, but don't make your post ""lol let's manipulate stonk ABCD cuz it has 14743% short interest YOLO!!1!"" Instead, put some actual effort into your posts and let's find some real opportunities.

We'll be removing low effort posts and banning people who post repeatedly without putting any effort into it. At the same time, let us all look for real opportunities, post legitimate due diligence and share real reasons that these opportunities can materialize into money for everyone.

Let's use this 15 min of fame as an opportunity to work together to improve our community, make more money, and improve the quality of the content for everyone!

Just a straight copy/paste from his newsletter today: 

If a lot of people on Reddit band together to drive the price of a stock higher, is that illegal? I have been asked that question a lot recently, and I want to be clear that:

1.	I don’t know, and

2.	If I did know, I wouldn’t tell you, because I do not give legal advice in this newsletter, and I particularly do not give legal advice that people on Reddit might read while pumping up stocks.



That said I suppose we should talk about the question in general and extremely not-legal-advice terms. I guess my answer would be that it might be illegal in all sorts of ways, but it is not obviously illegal, and if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were to go after WallStreetBets for this stuff they will be breaking new ground and going beyond their previous cases. I do not want to say “this stuff is all fine,” but I will say I am not all that bothered by it.

There are two main things that are illegal. One is “securities fraud.” This basically means lying about a stock. The other is “market manipulation.” Nobody knows what this means. Legally, it means something like:

>To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security … creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.

So if you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation. If you buy stock hoping that the price will go up because other people buy it, that’s not market manipulation; that’s just normal. Those things are not so different. There is a “traditional four-part test for manipulation that has developed in case law”: 


1.	I buy some GameStop stock.

2.	I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.

3.	People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.

4.	I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


So consider the general concept of a “pump-and-dump” scheme. The most classic pump-and-dump goes like this:

1) I buy some GameStop stock.


2) I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.


3) People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.


4) I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.

This is very straightforwardly illegal and the SEC goes after this stuff all the time, alleging securities fraud. Lying about stocks. Here is the SEC’s “Investor Alert: Social Media and Investing -- Stock Rumors,” which pretty much defines a pump-and-dump this way:

>For example, in a “pump-and-dump” scheme, promoters “pump” up the stock price by spreading positive rumors that incite a buying frenzy and they quickly “dump” their own shares before the hype ends. Typically, after the promoters profit from their sales, the stock price drops and the remaining investors lose money.

There are variations. The SEC has gone after forms of dishonesty that aren’t quite lying about the stock. For instance, if you are a widely followed stock promoter with a subscription tip newsletter, and you email tips to your subscribers and then sell your stock to them while saying that you’re buying, that seems dishonest, and the SEC will go after you. Or if you are a promoter or research firm and you put out positive research about a company, but you don’t disclose that the company paid you to put out the research, that is also bad. 

Now, I think you could do a pump-and-dump without any actual lying. For instance:


1.	I email subscribers to my expensive private newsletter saying “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people, innocents and high-frequency trading algorithms, see it go up on heavy volume and think “hey this is a good stock, we should buy it.” They buy it, pushing the price up.

5.	We sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


In this version, I have not lied about a stock. On the other hand, I have effected transactions in the stock to create trading activity and raise the price, for the purpose of inducing people to buy it. Seems like market manipulation, “painting the tape” or something. The SEC goes after stuff like this occasionally.

I think that in modern markets you could even do a bit better than that and have a completely honest pump-and-dump:

1.	I show up on Reddit and say “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people see us doing this, read my Reddit post, know we are pumping the stock, and also buy it, because we seem to be having fun, and they like fun too.

5.	Eventually some of us get bored and start selling and the price collapses.


The point here is that it is at least theoretically possible that no one buys stock for any reason other than “hey it’s a fun pump.” That is, no one is deceived about the fundamentals (there’s no fake news about the company), and also no one is deceived about the technicals. No one says “huh this stock is up on a lot of good buying pressure, I should buy some”; everyone who buys says “hey this stock is up because it’s being pumped, and if I get in now I might still get out before it collapses, and that’ll be fun.” It is “respect the pump” as a quasi-mystical mantra.

I bet the SEC would say that’s market manipulation, but I am not so sure. I suppose we did our trading “for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others,” but not by deceiving them about what’s going on. “Join us in a fun game of chicken,” was our basic message here. Did we try “to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand”? Who’s to say what’s “legitimate”? Surely the price did not reflect expectations about future cash flows, but just as surely the price reflected supply and demand: We all wanted to own it because we were having fun, so the price went up. 

Anyway, the actual GameStop situation. I suppose it’s possible that someone on Reddit has posted fake rumors about GameStop’s business, but I haven’t seen any. The posts I’ve seen about GameStop have been either (1) substance-free “GME to $1,000” stuff or (2) arguments based on publicly available information plus personal opinion and guesses about the future. They might be wrong or exaggerated or misstated, but it’s not, like, core fraud.

Is it manipulation? Well, there is not a lot of deception here. No one is buying GameStop stock because they think to themselves “boy this stock is going up a lot on heavy volume, must be a bunch of big institutions who see fundamental value here.” There is absolutely wall-to-wall coverage of GameStop in financial media, and it pretty much all says “lol those crazy redditors, pushing up the stock for no reason.” So at worst this is a sort of honest pump, people banding together to do it for the lolz and hoping they can get out before it collapses. 

I’m not even convinced it’s that though. The stock closed Friday at its all-time high. Roaring Kitty was up $11 million. Everyone came back on Monday and did it again. My model here—and I should emphasize this is purely a guess—is that the people most identified with the GameStop trade on Reddit, at this point, are much more interested in securing their legendary status on Reddit than they are in taking profits at the expense of whoever came in later. 

You could have other miscellaneous theories about words like “collusion” and “short squeezes.” Is it illegal for people to band together to all buy stock at the same time? “If institutional investors had an internet site or chat where they arguably cajoled each other or coordinated to buy stock to move the price higher,” one reader asked me by email, “wouldn’t that be stock manipulation and wouldn’t the SEC get involved?” 

Well, a while back there were reports that the SEC was looking into hedge fund “idea dinners,” where hedge funds get together to pitch each other on their third-best ideas. 1  That sounds like institutional investors having a chat where they cajole each other to buy stock in a coordinated way. But the SEC wasn’t concerned about market manipulation. The SEC was concerned that the hedge funds might be a “group” under the securities laws, if they teamed up to own more than 5% of the stock, and that they hadn’t made the necessary group disclosures. This is less of a concern for small retail investors, just because they are less likely to get above 5% of the company. 2  Also it doesn’t seem like the idea-dinner probe went anywhere. Telling your friends that you like a stock and they should buy it is, more or less, fine.

Or is a short squeeze illegal? One popular topic on WallStreetBets is recalling stock borrow. Kochkodin’s article describes one call to action in April 2020:

>The final all-caps sentence imploring GameStop owners to call their brokers and tell them to not lend them short opened a new theater to wage war against short-sellers.

>It’s a little known fact, and one that you wouldn’t expect to learn on a Reddit message board, that a stockholder can request that shares they own outright not be lent out to short-sellers.

If everyone bands together to recall stock borrow, there will be fewer shares available for short sellers, and the short sellers will be forced to cover their bets by buying stock, pushing the price up more. Is that illegal? Is it illegal to make borrow impossible with the goal of messing with short sellers?

The SEC might think so, actually. In 2012, it brought charges against Phil Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners LLC for, among other things, having “conducted an illegal ‘short squeeze’ to manipulate bond prices.” I confess I do not understand why the SEC thought a short squeeze was illegal, or what they think the fraud was, but the Falcone short squeeze is one of my all-time favorite financial stories and I advise you to read the complaint for humor and inspiration. Quick summary: Falcone owned some bonds of a company called MAAX Holdings Inc. “After hearing rumors that a Wall Street financial services firm was shorting the MAAX bonds and also encouraging its customers to do the same, Falcone decided to seek revenge.” So he bought all the MAAX bonds. Then he bought more: Short sellers would borrow MAAX bonds (presumably from him), and then sell them to him, so that he ended up with “22 million more bonds than MAAX had ever issued.” Then he stopped lending them out, forcing the short sellers to buy bonds to cover their shorts. But there were no bonds to be bought, since he owned them all (and more). At some point an executive from the “Wall Street firm” called up Falcone to talk about the situation, and even in the SEC’s dry language you can tell that it was one of the greatest conversations in all of Wall Street history:

>At some point, the conversation turned to the trading in the MAAX bonds. The senior officer asked Falcone how the Wall Street firm might satisfy its obligation to Harbinger. Falcone stated that the Wall Street firm should just keep bidding for the bonds. Falcone acknowledged that the Wall Street firm would suffer some losses doing so, but told the senior officer and the others that sometimes you are just on the wrong side of a trade.

>In the course of this discussion, Falcone stated that he knew that the short position in the MAAX zips had created a “long” position in excess of the issue size. When the senior officer asked how he could possibly know this, Falcone stated that he was working the position himself and that he (i.e., Harbinger) had acquired approximately 190 million bonds. The senior officer and the other the Wall Street firm personnel were stunned.

“Just keep bidding for the bonds,” “sometimes you are just on the wrong side of a trade,” I love it so much.

Where were we? Oh, right, GameStop. I suppose a really coordinated successful effort to squeeze borrow might count as market manipulation, at least in the SEC’s view, but I’m not sure how serious this effort was. In any case it hasn’t worked. “Despite a punishing two weeks and relentless chat-room taunting, GameStop Corp. haters are showing no signs of surrender,” Bloomberg reported yesterday; short interest has barely budged, and there are still shares available to borrow.

I don’t know. Taking a step back: Should the SEC care about all of this? On the one hand, I do not see a whole lot of deception in this GameStop situation. The SEC’s core concerns, about people lying about stocks and tricking the innocent, don’t seem especially implicated here; everyone is having reasonably informed and consensual fun. 

On the other hand it is all pretty dumb? Like if you are a securities regulator, you can think of your job narrowly as preventing people from lying about stocks, or more broadly as encouraging capital formation and fostering confidence in markets and moving markets toward efficiency and perfection. And, you know, this is the opposite of that. A popular conclusion from the GameStop story is “well I guess the stock market is nonsense now,” and I’m not sure that conclusion is wrong. Seems like the sort of thing the SEC wouldn’t like. But what can they do about it?

l5l413_GME,GME,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

There are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.

There has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.

Short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.

Short sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.

That being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.

GME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).

There is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.

Previous short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.

In order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).

So what is happening now, and where do we go from here?

Right now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.

Even as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.

GME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.

At this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.

Having said this, wouldn’t this result in another gamma squeeze since I know call sellers will have to hedge by buying more shares but it would only drive up share prices which also makes more calls ITM??

l512w5_MS,MS,GME Investor Attempts at Math,"Hello GME investors and lurkers!

I think we can all agree on the fact that today was a roller-coaster of emotions. I had to do a lap around the office when the share price hit $135, but we know how it would fall to $76.79 EOD price per share. It is fair to say that a few of you guys are a bit nervous about this, as you may have bought-in at a high price; however, I hope to show you with math that you should keep your ✋💎🤚 strong and sturdy like u/DeepFuckingValue, as I feel like we can get a close appropriation to the height of this gamer fueled ride.

Before I get to the calculation portion, I just want to say that I believe that we need to stop comparing GME to the Volkswagon Squeeze. u/Fage138 did a great write up [and I recommend giving it a read](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4f9xz/why_the_volkswagen_squeeze_stopped/). This is a different beast entirely, and we must avoid selling to reach the goal of $1,000+ per share. u/Kintsugi2 has pointed out in [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ypu3/gme_watch_out/) to look out for the short-seller's moves, as well as u/Blizzgarg on how the stock was [attacked by the institutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zbff/today_was_a_coordinated_attack_by_institutions/) that are holding the tendies we will sow. Now on to the math:

&#x200B;

* The float dropped today from 141% to just 139%, which leads to a total of 2%.
* That 2% helped skyrocket the stock price to $159.18 a share, from Friday's EOD of 65.01
* That means that the 2% gave GME a stock jump of nearly 41% or just 20.5% per 1% of the float
* What happens if we apply this percentage for the remaining 139% on today's EOD of $76.79?
* We get an answer that looks like this:
   * **PERCENTAGE CALCULATION**
      * (% Quantity x % per Share) = 139 x 20.5 = 2,849.5%
      * Note - It is not 139% x 20.5% or 139 x 20.5%, as that would just give you a percentage of a percentage or number. Each 1% is equal to a 20.5% stock price increase.
   * **PRICE PER SHARE CALCULATION**
      * \[(Percentage Calc. x EOD Price) + EOD Price\] = (2,849.5% x 76.79) + 76.79 =  2,264.92
   * **TOTAL VALUE**
      * *$2,264.92 per share.*

&#x200B;

Take note that my calculation will change based on the float remaining % and the EOD price of GME's shares. I hope this will help comfort some of you who are nervous about investing a lot of your money into this, but you have to keep the faith! Unlike some of the more stock-smart investors here, I am not a chart reader. All I am is a guy who grew up surrounded by farmers and farmland, and have learned that you have to make sure the soil, seeds, moisture levels, and weather are at a point to determine if it will be a good harvest this year. In my eyes, GME can be the crop of the decade.

GME has this with a new CEO, Ryan Cohen and gang, and a new direction for the future of gaming & PC part supplier & assembler. Their moves showed a strong indicator of a turnaround from their old fashioned ways, and it is why I am invested in them right now with 350 shares at an average cost of $77.10 a share. Days like this show how much we say the price does not matter, but it still does. This is a normal thing for anyone to have, and you should not ignore it; however, you have to do your own due diligence when it comes to investing, and I hope you have been making good moves.

Just to be clear, this is NOT financial advice on whether you should or should not invest in GME. This post is just here to help reassure those who feel like they are going down a sinking ship, or got in at the top and will lose it all. I am not much of a poster, and more of a commentator in any subreddit; however, I want you guys to know what I had come up with, and would love to hear any/all feedback you may have for me and my calculations. Please pay any winnings you make forward to a donation towards a helpful charity of your choice as well. r/WSBGivesBack is something we can do to not get fame and karma but to help those less fortunate than ourselves. Thank you all for your time, and please keeps your hands as strong as diamonds these next few weeks!

**TL;DR**:

$2,264.92 per share based on remaining float % remaining is possible, but we must 🤚💎✋ it to Pluto 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Edit**:

Thank you to the person(s) that awarded the post!

I just want everyone to know that my intent on this post was to stir up a discussion on how you guys see the stock moving. ""I'm right. You're wrong. I win. Bye Bye,"" is not the intent with my smooth brained math skills. As a lot of you have pointed out, price is not linear with stocks. I am aware of this, but the basis of the example is to show what might happen with the stock. Either way folks, make sure to keep your hands diamond strong, and see you all on the moon! 🚀🌕

l3xy7m_MS,MS,What Everyone is Getting Wrong About GME,"WSB Controls GME Sentiment, not the Price.

&#x200B;

Long read here but there is analogy using the Magic School bus so........yeah.

TL:DR: at bottom.

I've seen far too many people on this sub, Stinktwits, Tweeter, CNBC, WSJ, Barron's etc. incorrectly state that WSB is controlling GME.  We have not, nor will we ever be in control of GME.  Simply put, our \~5% ownership isn't enough to push the price around.  As much as you retards, and the retard(s) on CNBC, and the retards on print media WANT everyone to believe it, its just not true so I wanted to clarify a few things going forward.

First, the media, Shitron, and others are trying to paint WSB as a collective or a whole entity, and NOT as a group of individuals.  This claim is baseless, and has been mentioned here before but of course that won't stop them.  If in fact we were a collective, that would set a dangerous precedent and we would almost certainly be shut down.  Think of like Pirate Bay. If one person illegally uploads a movie that person is in violation of the law, but if 10000 people upload a couple seconds of said movie, and those pieces are stitched together it becomes a lot harder to make it illegal.

The story of GME began much like M. Burry's big short began - someone looked!  That person was r/DeepFuckingValue (and M. Burry, himself).  Let's use the Magic School Bus as an example. DFV is played by Ms. Frizzle. Here she comes around the bend in her little short bus on route to pick you mini autists up, but when she opens the door to the bus no one gets on!  Ms. Frizzle is not discouraged, so she wrangles you retards up and throws you on the bus.  Off you go on the adventure of your life, launching into the stratosphere to discover a new planet further than the Moon and Mars. You name this newly found planet Valhalla.  When you return you can't stop telling people about your trip!

This is where we get to my point.  We are in control of the SENTIMENT surrounding GME, not the price.   You little autists have seen valhalla already, and can't stop telling others about how magical it is. Soon enough, other autists want to ride the short bus out to Valhalla, and so they buy their tickets (stonks) and then they tell their friends etc etc.  Take Tesla for example (with a P/E of 1700), does that stop the ~~retards~~ geniuses from buying?

This is what we are doing to GME.  We didn't push our weight around as WSB and somehow, singlehandedly destroy the shorts.  No, retail just doesn't have that kind of power (hence why its B.S the media is pushing the narrative...LOL though they sure know how to make an autist blush).  WSB somehow, SOMEHOW edgeukated enough people on the GME story about how undervalued they were, financially healthy they were, how shorted the stock was, Lord Cohen et al, etc, and the story took off.

You see? We are controlling the SENTIMENT around GME which in turn, is controlling the price.  Lets continue this going forward because its what got us to where we are.  If we really want this squeeze to happen there is going to have to be conviction on behalf of the buyers.  So go out there and edgeukate more people on the stock that everyone missed (apart from you DFV (xoxo) and Burry).

Make sure they know this ain't no pump and dump. Everyone gets caught up in the stonk price when they should be looking at market cap.  Sure, we hit the highest price last week, but not the highest  market cap GME has ever had. In reality, we've just recently corrected to the proper valuation GME should have been at all along (if it weren't for those greedy shorts!).

So next time you post about GME, make sure you remind people about the above points and the fact that  the squeeze hasn't squoze yet, and that RC and Reggie Fils Aime are now driving this short bus!

You keep the SENTIMENT high, the stonk price goes more uppies.

(someone add a rocket emoji...or perhaps a school bus?)

TL/DR:  WSB is controlling the SENTIMENT around GME, not the price.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

l43wrh_GME,GME,GME: The Long Thesis and Hopeful Return to Sanity,"My purpose in writing this is to try to bring some sanity back to the public markets. I recognize we may be long past that point, but if it helps marginally, it’s worth saying.

By way of background, I am a private equity investor with 10 years of experience. I have done due diligence on companies in industries in secular decline as well as true FOMO companies (Theranos – thankfully passed).

I will avoid speaking about the short squeeze potential because 1) there are others more qualified and 2) it’s not how I personally invest and have been trained.

**The Long Thesis**

If I were asked to evaluate GME from a take private perspective, there is a real thesis. There have been many comparisons to Blockbuster and traditional retail that I think underappreciate the difference in product. I still enjoy playing the N64 version of Super Smash Brothers that came out in 1999 when my childhood friends and I get together. Setting aside my nerdiness, the engagement and loyalty of a video game far exceeds that of a movie or apparel. The demographics are increasingly female (reportedly half). So GME is selling a product that can span generations and potentially engage entire families.

Does this mean there needs to be a physical retailer? When Amazon emerged, there was a lot of speculation that physical retail was on its way out and Wal-Mart was becoming obsolete . And while the physical retail landscape has certainly changed, its total demise was hyperbole. Amazon acquired Whole Foods and Wal-Mart is thriving. Smaller retailers have had to shutter but the ones that have survived have emerged stronger. The point here is even if video games move to a digital delivery option, there remains room for a physical retailer of scale in the market. With a ~$4.5bn market cap, GME still has potential to grow with a slice of this industry.

I’m sure people smarter than I have opinions as to what GME needs to do to stay relevant and value-add to game developers, but my view would be to evolve into experiential visits with excellent customer service (incidentally, Chewy’s competitive advantage). Video games have massive budgets with well-known characters. They are brands with potential for licensing of additional products. In addition, e-sports is quickly growing in popularity. The entire physical ecosystem around gaming has immense potential that we are in the early innings of.

Last point, there is an experienced founder aligned with shareholders. I’ve seen great management teams make money in crappy industries and poor management teams lose money in great industries. People can take their own view on his capability, but his money is where his mouth is.

**Valuation**

By any traditional metric, GME is currently overvalued. But part of the reason is because it’s so heavily shorted. The market’s ability to price discover is completely out of whack here. However, the potential for a near term bankruptcy is now gone (incidentally thanks in part to the short sellers) with a more resilient shareholder base than they could’ve expected. Yet shorts continue to stay the course / rise, presumably now holding onto the idea that the valuation will come back down to earth and help recoup their losses. If I pushed to invest in a company only to later discover that a meaningful part of my original thesis was broken, I would be fired much less advocate to invest more.

Shorting a company only because it’s overvalued is not a good thesis in this market. GSX is very likely fraudulent. SFIX is a people based apparel retailer that will have to compete against its suppliers because they need to develop their own D2C platforms. There’s overvaluation everywhere and better short plays.

**Conclusion**

This brings me to my ultimate point and hope. For those that have been long GME – congratulations. It’s impressive to see the support and conviction and it's made me rethink aspects of how I invest. I hope for the company’s sake you are long-term holders. For those thinking about getting in now for the short term, know that you are gambling. You do you, but you could also go to the roulette table and put your money on black which would be faster and more straightforward than trying to time this play.

For those that are short, stop being your own worst enemy. This is not the hill in which I would choose to die on. There's enough notoriety now that new institutions and retail investors may come in to try and break you which undermines the market and the system we’re trying to support. I don’t have a position in GME nor do I intend to start one. I’d just like for some rationality to return to the market.

Good luck to all!

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

l46blh_GME,GME,The Infinity Squeeze of 08 briefly made $VW the most valuable company in the world. How much would $GME have to go up in order for it to achieve the same?,"On Oct 28 of 2008, $VW shares traded as high as $912 during the famous ""infinity short squeeze"", making the automaker the most valuable company in the world (albeit for just a fleeting moment.) How much would $GME have to go up in order for it to become the most valuable company in the world? 

Now I want to preface this by saying it is highly improbable (actually, virtually impossible) that this will happen. The following calculations are for your amusement only and should not be considered investment advice. Disclaimer: I do not hold any $GME positions. Disclaimer 2: I failed high school math so my calculations could be off by a couple of decimal points.

Currently, the most valuable publicly traded company is Apple $AAPL with a market cap of $2.34 trillion or $2,340 billion. As of Friday closing, GameStop $GME's market cap was $4.53 billion. For $GME's market cap to surpass $AAPL, it would have to reach $33581.33 per share--a 51556% increase from its current price or 1306667% from its 52 week low of $2.57.

Inversely, if you had shorted $GME at $10 a share, your losses would be peak at about 335710%. So, say you shorted 5,000,000 shares of $GME at $10, your losses would theoretically amount to $167,856,000,000.

For the newcomers who are joining us due to the recent activity in GME, its important to know that derivatives are not magic money printing products; rather they are one tool of many meant to provide flexibility and liquidity in the market.  As such, they have uses in a variety of strategies and can seem overwhelming and complex at first blush.  It will take you some time and effort to become comfortable with them, so please give yourself some slack and don't dive in head first because of fear of missing out (FOMO).

You'll see a lot of traders here talk about how GME can only go up from here, how it's not a pump and dump, the mechanics of gamma squeezes, and how this is unlike anything that's happened before.  Many of us see these same discussions play out every few months for the ""next big thing"", and most of the time what goes up does eventually come down (see NKLA, TLRY, RKT, QS, etc.).

While we can't and wouldn't discourage you from  joining the fray, you should at a minimum give serious consideration to position sizing, max loss, and how much you are truly comfortable losing.  Please don't mortgage your house to put on your first, second, or even 10,000th option trade.  These resources will help you assess your risk.  You can find these and more in the weekly thread.

\*Note #1: If you pre-order a product or buy GME gift cards before Jan 31 they will be counted as a liability (debt) until the product is shipped or gift card redeemed. Any pre-order can be assumed to be a debt for this Quarter if the order is placed before Jan 31. If you buy a gift card and don't redeem it before Jan 31 it will count **against** GME for this quarter. Ultimately, pre-orders are good for business and so are gift card sales, as long as they are eventually redeemed.

Note #2: Try to use the App for your purchases. **Take notes on anything frustrating about the user experience while you are making the purchases.** I've already noted a bunch of Feedback that would be easy for them to change.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Step 3 - PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE APP**

[The feedback section on the App can be found by navigating to \\""Profile \> \(scroll all the way down\) \> About\/Feedback \> Send Feedback \> App Review\\""](https://preview.redd.it/9ys1scicn1d61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d54db70c8cdb4d44a70196e820367ea596122d5)

* Submit any feedback from the notes you took while making your purchases
* What the fuck is better than thousands of degenerates Quality Assurance testing the GameStop App and filing bugs? It takes a huge workload off internal GME resources and we, as the users, are in the best position to provide meaningful suggestions.
* Rate the App 5 stars if you are feeling inclined

**Example feedback:** I found that I'm not able to use my regular password due to special character limitations. This limitation would have an effect on a user that relies on a Password Vault auto-generated password.

# TLDR: Here's the point... we can stop buying many products from other companies entirely- and try to leverage GameStop as our one-stop-shop as much as possible. We have until end of January for one last push to make upcoming Earnings an interstellar journey 🚀🚀🚀🥜🥜🥜

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Positions:** Fidelity Regular - 110 Shares, Fidelity IRA - 700 shares, Robinhood - 450 shares

BTW, I confirmed with Fidelity today that ""Share Lending"" is NOT enabled by default on the brokerage. You have to sign a bunch of documents to grant those fuckers the ability to lend out your shares to the 🌈🐻s

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts:** PEANUT GANG, RISE UP!!! 🥜🥜🥜

If you have any other good strategies to help bolster GME's upcoming earnings, let me know and I'll add it.

What is currently happening with GME is finally a time where the little guy can swing right back as a united army. Let this be a lesson to short sellers. We will not be taken advantage of.  

This is a little quote from when Volkswagen was shorted and it back fired. ""VW short quickly saw their collective losses exceed $30 billion.   Hedge fund managers were “literally in tears on the phone” as they described “a nuclear bomb going off in our faces.”

Some brokers (**cough** Robhinhood) will happily loan out your shares to people who want to short stocks you own. Did I mention the gobs of money they make doing this?

The following table compares the *fully-owned* share lending programs offered by brokers, if any:

|**Broker**|*Fully-Owned Share Lending*|
|:-|:-|
|Ally Invest|\#3: Enrolling in Ally's [Securities Income program](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/) requires meeting certain requirements and completing an opt-in form. You need to make a call to Ally to unenroll.|
|Avanza|\#2a: Their website says that ""[Everyone is included automatically](https://www.avanza.se/konton-lan-prislista/konton/kapitalforsakring/aktielan.html)"", with an option for manual [opt-out](https://www.avanza.se/min-profil/installningar/aktielan.html) of the program. However, /u/Snelsel reports that ""lending only applies to those who have capital insurance activated. Capital insurance is not active by default. I called them and it did not apply to my ”aktiedepå-konto”. As per their website it is also clear that the receiver is Morgan Stanley. There are several prerequisites for the loaning to happen. One being that Avanza Pensionsfonder is trading the stocks you happen to own."" And /u/Insani0us reports that share lending ""only applies to Kapitalförsälringskonton and not ISKs"".|
|BinckBank (SaxoBanck group)|No info submitted. Feel free to contact your broker, and I will add here any info they provide you!|
|BM mBank via KBC broker (Polish)|\#5: /u/Lamatotalna reports no fully-owned share lending program|
|BMO (Bank of Montreal)|\#5: Their client agreement allows for BMO to lend/borrow shares without explicit authroization from the user, ""so long as any Obligations to BMO InvestorLine exist."" In other words, they can loan your shares but only if you had a negative margin balance (i.e. using money borrowed from the broker).|
|Bolero (Belgium)|\#5: /u/kama5638 reports no fully-owned share lending program|
|capital.com|\#2b: /u/Obvious-Elk8708 provided the reply from capital.com support, ""We kindly note that trading on Capital.com you don't own real shares."" capital.com uses [CFDs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp); the underlying shares can be loaned out since you don't own them to begin with.|
|Comdirect|\#5: /u/FpoonSpork reports no fully-owned share lending program|
|Commsec|\#5: /u/MikeOxxxmal reports in a conversation with support that Commsec shares ""are not and will not"" be lent out.|
|Degiro|\#1: Share are lent if you have a ""basic account"" plan. You can avoid this by using a ""custody account"" instead. The account type cannot be converted, so you need to create a new custody account and then transfer funds over. **NOTE:** According to a customer service email received by /u/LeftyLuke-87, ""... share lending at DEGIRO is only internally possible and that it is not possible to lend American stocks. \[If\] your only position is in Gamestop, making a Custody account will not make a difference.""|
|eToro (US)|\#2a: Share lending is the default. You can file a support request to opt-out. You need to be firm with them about it, as they will try to convince you not to disable it (it's a big money maker for brokers)|
|eToro (UK, Slovenia)|\#5: /u/Ed_Fire reports a reply from eToro UK support: ""eToro does not currently engage in securities lending. However, we may decide that this is the appropriate action to take in the future. Please note that, should we decide to go in this direction, it will not be possible to opt out of this process.""|
|eTrade|\#3: eTrade will give you 50% of share-lending proceeds if you opt-in to their [Fully Paid Lending program](https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/fully-paid-lending). However, they will loan out your margin account shares regardless of your participation in this program. The only difference is whether you're getting paid 50% or not. So you should either opt-in, or downgrade to a cash account to prevent shares from being lent.|
|Fidelity|\#4: Fidelity will loan out your securities if you have options level 3 or 4 trading permissions. You can phone them at 800-343-3548 and tell them not to lend specific shares (or all shares), which will take effect after a 3-5 day adjudication process and may or may not result in downgrading to level 2 options trading level. (Other uses report success using [Live Chat](https://chat.fidelity.com/ftgw/chat/guest/login_page?verror=yes)). Fidelity ALSO has a separate [Fully Paid Lending program](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending) which will allow you to profit from lending your shares, but you need an account value >= 250k to be eligible.|
|Firstrade|\#3: /u/strongholdtothemars reports that securities lending defaults to opt-in. You should be able to request to be removed from this program.|
|Freetrade|\#5: /u/ancientgreenthings reports no fully-owned share lending|

|Interactive Brokers|\#3: IB's [Stock Yield Enhancement program](https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46942) can be found under Settings --> Account Settings on their website (last item on right-hand pane). Default opt-in when you signup with them with a margin account. However, a credible individual also reports that ""IB reserved the right to lend the stock"", regardless of whether you opt-in to the Stock program to receive your cut. You cannot disable this, at least for IB users trading in Germany. This may or may not apply to other countries too, we don't know at this point.|

|Vanguard|\#5: No fully-owned share lending program|
|Wealth Simple|\#5: No fully-owned share lending program|
|Webull|\#2a: Webull loans out your shares, regardless whether you have a Margin or Cash account. You can opt-out on the Webull app under Settings --> Account & Security --> Brokerage Account --> More --> Stock Lending Income Program --> Exit|

**Reasons you might want to disable your share lending settings include:**

1. You don't want to lend your shares to people trying to short your stocks
2. You think the person/entity loaning your stock may not return them
3. You're not being compensated well enough (or at all) for putting your stocks at risk

These programs are complex and highly variable depending on your broker. Without getting into all the details now just now, you should be aware of the most common types of lending:

* Brokers reserve the right to lend out securities **bought on margin** (in other words, with borrowed money from your broker). **To avoid this type of lending, don't buy stocks on margin.** As far as I know, this is the case for all brokers that offer margin accounts. (However if you have explicit confirmation to the contrary from your broker, feel free to provide it here!)
   * Same deal with unsettled trades. Your broker will loan out shares you bought until they are required to ""really"" deliver them to you at settlement 3 days layer, which also applies to cash accounts. Additionally, your broker can lend out shares purchased with unsettled funds in a margin account. You can only minimize this by trading less (in the first case) and not trading with unsettled funds (in the second case).
* Most brokers can ALSO lend out your fully-owned shares. Brokers will do one of the following:

1. Lend out **fully-owned** shares purely based on the **type of account** or level of trading permissions you have (e.g., Margin account type). The only solution in this case is switching account and/or trading permission types. Example: Degiro
2. Lend out **fully-owned** shares **regardless of account type** (even Cash accounts).
   1. Some brokers **allow you to opt-out**. Example: Webull
   2. Some brokers **do not allow you to opt-out**. Your only recourse to avoid lending is switching brokers. Example: M1 finance
3. Lend out **fully-owned** shares in a Margin account, and giving you a **portion of the profits**. These programs vary widely in the way they work. Some require account minimums (Fidelity requires 250k+ account), or will only loan domestic shares (e.g. Nordnet), among other caveats.
4. Some combination of the above
5. None of the above (i.e. no lending) Example: TDA, Vanguard

So yeah, every broker does it differently. The numbered scenarios here are referenced in the table above. The table only addresses **fully-owned share lending**, because the ability for your broker to lend your shares bought on margin is (as far as I know) the same with all brokers.",2021-01-22,6032,1121

l17618_MS,MS,Citron Research In A Nutshell. $GME holders read.,"Who the fuck is **Citron Research**? Well here’s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on r/wsb with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn’t my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain’t good enough.

**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew’s a 🌈🐻, in long he’s a self proclaimed “*activist short seller*”. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company’s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there’s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  

Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed “*activist*” we’re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : “He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.” His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world’s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again “After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.” Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn’t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). 

SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn’t enough wait to hear the companies in his “*ambitious track record*”. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could’ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the 🌈🐻 because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.


**SCANDAL #1**. Here’s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this 🌈🐻 was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing “false and/or misleading claims” about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He’s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo’ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW 🌈🐻 said they’re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE’S **NO WAY** THEY’RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now i’m pretty sure if you’ve been active on the sub you’ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I’ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he’s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron’s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

**NOTE** :

Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.

A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway 💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼 its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode 🔥🚀

TL;DR : Citron’s been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WON’T EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB. LET US FUCKING TAKE OFF AUTISTS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Anyway, in the metro (in Paris remember?) I saw a group of teenage kids that were excited as bunch of zits can be, and where do you think they were coming from? Micromania, French brand 100% owned by GME.

My point is this: it's the weekend during a pandemic and these kids SHOP FOR GAMES AT B&M STORES. With their friends, because that's what you do when you are 15 and you don't have a fucking credit card but you saved up on pennies selling croissants all year long - jk, these kids don't need to work.

Games are fun, games are social. You buy games with your friends, it's a ritual. Brand loyalty is real. Shelling out 60 bucks for a game when you are a teenager is like YOLOing all your savings in a stock: it deserves celebration, so you go out with your friends and make it an event.

TLDR: GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Position: $5k in GME which is 100% of my NW. Fuck you.",2021-01-19,166,30

l0czgs_WFC,WFC,"GME - EndGame Part 2: Cohen, Market Cap, Potential Investors","Hello again folks. This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME’s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there’s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.

In this post, I’m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME’s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.

**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I’ve gone all-in - *I’m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you’re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you’re going to lose by selling when it drops.

# Quick aside - my history and positions:

I’ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I’ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I’ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I’ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.

**UPDATE**: I have deleted my positions in this post - will explain why in my next post. I'm still holding. 

All that being said, thus far I’ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I’ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That’s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I’m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.

Grab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I’ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn’t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you’re willing to **believe and hold.**

# About Cohen (and friends)

From the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you’re putting serious money in):

*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*

This is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.

1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME’s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn’t attempt a hostile takeover.
2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said “no” to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.

In addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):

* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)
* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)

He’s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he’s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.

As a result of the agreement, he’s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He’s not happy with a single board seat; he’s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he’s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**

Also, remember that **Alan and Jim have 💲 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.

## Cohen is not an exec - he’s a founder with an all-in mentality

Go read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.

1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:
   1. *“When I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\*.”\*
   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You’re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you’re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**
   3. *“Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”*
2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad’s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he’s itching to get back in.
3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.
4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.
   1. *“ Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.”*
   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.
   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.
   4. I’m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*
5. Cohen’s 9,001,000 (it’s over 9000! 🐲🏐) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.

So Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he’s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen’s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.

## What will lead to Cohen’s next purchase of GME

Thus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.

1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):
   1. “We recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)”**  (what a *fucking burn*).
2. If there was any doubt about RC’s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3’s earnings, where the current leadership’s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - “The market wants me. Let me the fuck in.”
3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he’s going to angle for CEO. He’s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He’s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*

**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he’s sending another message.** This time it’s because it’s clear to him he’s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it’s “CEO talks going well” - you fucking buy.**

# GME’s market cap potential

1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME’s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\+.
2. Chewy’s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.
3. Chewy’s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME’s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy’s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).
4. GME’s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

In other words, *even if you give GME’s physical locations no value*, GME’s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.

**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**

What. The. Fuck.

I’ve never seen a stock more mispriced.

People talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*

Even if you *completely* discount

1. GME’s physical business
2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT
3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM

and give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**

**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you’re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You’re going to only care if you’re in or not.

# Potential Investors

An asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?

Here’s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.

1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.
   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀
2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I’m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It’s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.
3. **Cohen’s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.
   1. Look, I’ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don’t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don’t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don’t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME’s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he’s CEO.** As soon as he’s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.
      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.
   2. Thus far, it’s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That’s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.
4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate 💎✋🤚. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. 💎✋🤚 doesn’t mean selling at $100. It doesn’t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.
   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.
   2. Remember Buffett’s actual quote: [**""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)

**I’ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.

This is personal research. **Do your own DD.**

A wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***“Don’t aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.”*** If you’re not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren’t participating.

Oh, and of course: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Update 1:** I'm still holding today, but I realized I made a pretty big mistake on the ecommerce revenue analysis. GME's 2019 e-commerce revenue was 1.35B (not 1.35B for the quarter), so divide my price target by 4 - $125/share or $8B market cap.",2021-01-19,2385,341

Likewise, to my fellow GameStop/GME GANG BULLS: The longer we wait, the bigger our reward. **Let me explain.**

Let's assume shorts haven't even covered yet (and many analysts say they haven't), then the bigger our initial investment capital to be multiplied to theoretical infinity, and that's not even counting our call options (juicy gamma squeeze, anyone?). Now, let's do some math.

**Assumptions:**

• Assume C(n) is 'zero point', prior to squeeze; where 'C' is initial capital, and 'n' is all the compounded multiplier *prior* to the deadly short squeeze. Basically, it's just your total capital multiplied by organic % growth. It's some king shit. Let's say that C(e) is ending capital. Remember the 'compound interest is king' worship on subs like r/investing? Well, my fellow retards, this is compound interest on fucking steroids so scientifically advanced it hasn't even been birthed yet.

• Assume days-to-cover is about 6 as per avg. daily volume and number of shares shorted needing to be unwound, under a 100% of float shorted scenario (which, in our case, is actually 250%-300%+. Who knows how that shit plays out. (I like to play conservative: positive surprise is better than negative.)) (edit: some folks say that the average volume in the past few days has risen by 'x' amount. Might be true, but it could also die down to an averaged baseline since the volume spike was more organic buying imo. Also, consider that the *current* short % of float is **260.91%\*\*\*\*** as of writing (Yahoo! Finance, Dec. 20, 2020 data). That's good for Longs, *absolutely fucking terrifying* for shorts given current circumstances. Take from that as you will.)

•Assume 50% increase in share price (SP) per day during short squeeze panic. (Even that's probably conservative, but, who knows. I'm not a fortune teller.)

Then;

**MOASS (conservative) Price Target (PT) = (SP)(1.5)\^6**

**and C(e) = C(n) x ((SP)(1.5)\^6)/SP)**

Think about that for a sec.

Now, let's assume shorts will start to cover for their **goddamn souls** by **SP=$50**. Then;

**Price Target (PT) = ($50)(1.5)\^6**

**Price Target (PT) = $569.53.\*\***

Let's stagger this down to steps by change-per-day so it's easier to visualize, following above assumptions:

>Day 0 (D0): $50 (+0%, zero point)  
>  
>Day 1 (D1): $75 (+50% from D0) = 1.5-bagger  
>

**Literally an 11-bagger in a matter of 6 days by conservative day-over-day 'squeeze' growth estimates.** (edit: I'm adding a variation factor, or randomness factor as I want to call it, of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, just to cover our bases. I've read more on other people's MOASS PTs, and the 11-bagger seems to be on the upper end (I will not retract the PT though, and I am confident in the mathematical power of exponential compounding, esp. in this historical short squeeze data on GME). I enjoy the fact, however, that by consensus, we all agree on the whopping potential multiples this short squeeze can generate.**\*\*\*\*\*\***) (edit: There's been comments about the massive sell-walls at $420.69, hence, it could curtail any share price growth beyond that point. If it even reaches that point, that would be fucking hilarious. Even funnier at $694.20.)

**$TSLA performance 1-yr to date is an 8-bagger.** (Shoutout to our TSLA brothers, we love you and shit. GME gang will join you in tendie-land soon.)

The legendary **VW Short Squeeze** was a little under 5-bagger over the course of several days, and even then,

**I will quote DOMO Capital\*\*\* on a recent example:**

>it took [$APRN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APRN&src=cashtag_click) 3-4 days to squeeze.

>Day 1: Up as high a 86%, closed up 68%

>  
>$2.25 to $28.84 at peak  
>  
>That was without >100% SI

**You read that right. That was without >100% SI. And in this example, $APRN was a 13-bagger (+1281.77%) over the course of 3-4 days.** **Meanwhile, our hypothetical GME scenario above yielded an 11-bagger (+1100%) after 6 days, on (imo) conservative day-over-day short squeeze spikes of 50%.** I know that +1000%+ looks almost impossible on paper. Sure, maybe as an isolated, singular event. But stretch that over to multiple days with compounding interest overwhelmingly in your favor, and you can get there in no time (if you're still confused about that, re-read the visualized step-by-step change-per-day above). That's why you can have small initial capital amounts grow into millions of dollars after many years of passive investing, but, that's for r/investing to talk about.

[+7&#37; YoY index investing growth until age 65? We don't do that here. 1000&#37;+ or bust bitch](https://preview.redd.it/hkz8itzf3db61.jpg?width=1046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74375f3871fc0664f10d154d404a03eae1f6a339)

GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. They have to cover eventually, and the water boils hot by the second. 

What catalysts can be 'surpriseful' enough to lead shorts to cover to their deaths, you might ask? Who knows. What I do know, however, and something which has NOW BEEN PROVEN to be validated by (at the very least) recent price action alone, is that sweet sugar daddy Ryan Cohen and our CHWY daddies Alan Attal and Jim Grube *know what they're doing.* Who knows what kind of walls they'll be breaking in these coming days, weeks, or months. And each and any of them can become the flashy red nuclear button to send this bitch running. (edit: Jim Cramer had a segment on Mad Money today about the ripe-ness of GME to fucking SQUEEZE INTO MOASS.\*\*\*\*\* You read that right: GME + MOASS potential + CRAMER. He also seems to love WSB, and probably jacks off to our gains. Hi Cramer! See link below: thanks to u/CPTHubbard for sharing the link.)

Then again, I might be retarded as fuck, take these assumptions with a grain of salt. Long live WSB, and long live GME gang.

**Bonus:** ""but u/fieryskyes, how do I know when the tip has topped?""

*My* answer: Who knows. Feel free to set yourself a limit sell, or not. Just remember that MM's and many other advanced traders can see your limit sells (e.g. $420.69) via Level II data. If (and that's an if) and when the MOASS starts to happen, you will know. WSB will be going apeshit about it. With regards to my own *personal* strategy, I'll be watching the price spike *actively* over the span of the days it squeezes. No limit sell, no stop loss.. I'd rather see the price peak to the highest peak, knowing it has maxed out, and then catch it as it freefalls, than SELLING too early without having even seen the peak yet. Seeing the glorious green dildo peak is ejaculatory enough for me, and I'll be ready to unwind shortly \[pun intended\] as it falls. *But then again,* that's just my personal preference on the play. There could be better plays, in which I'd be open to exploring.

**TL;DR: Under the assumptions written above, GME MOASS Price Target is potentially an 11-bagger on conservative estimates over a 6-day period, and the short squeeze (reportedly) hasn't even begun yet. GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. Join now, or die in FOMO forever.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*: possibly final edit: I've been browsing through other MOASS Price targets, and seems like my range is up the upper end so far. For that reason, I'm including a variation range of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, to account for randomness, and just to cover our bases. The key thing to note is that MOASS price targets are in whopping multiples of current SP. I will not retract the 11-bagger PT, as it just shows the power of exponential compounding interest in a once-in-a-lifetime MOASS scenario, given our current data on GME and its boiling rocket fuel.

Will need to wait until February for potential infrastructure plan.","Biden 1.9T Plan Unveiled - We will have to wait until February for any supposed Infrastructure Plan. This is strictly covid relief. Link to plan below.


Here’s what Biden calls for:

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000 including December’s $600 payments

Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it through the end of September

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour

Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September

$350 billion in state and local government aid

$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education

$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing

$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes

Make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increase the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)

The plan is the first of two major spending initiatives Biden will seek in the first few months of his presidency, according to senior Biden officials.

#The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect’s longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combatting climate change and advancing racial equity.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

Hello again, GME Gang. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!

And an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).  

Now Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?

Anyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. 

Now, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. 

First thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.

Now, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. 

**Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**

Now, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.

So to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. 

Are you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere).

**Part 2****: GameStop Isn’t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**

So, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim. This story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.” 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) 

But Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.

No, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.

So fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: 

First, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) 

[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)

That’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad-ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\_Ventures\_Letter\_to\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) 

So now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?

Now, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.

**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads** 

And now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.

Now you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\_tribe\_a\_story\_about\_how\_ryan\_cohen\_is\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.

But here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.

There was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.

Now, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here.

And if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)— you’d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**.

But what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.""* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \[GameStop, it\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*

I really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.

And now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:

\*\*\*

Bloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)

· ""It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,"" he says. ""When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in."" 

· Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”

· He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \[non-diversified\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”

· He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. ""I don't want to swing for a single,"" he says.

\*\*\*

You hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.

Here’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:

\*\*\*

Forbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)

· “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”

· “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”

· “\[M\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”

· “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”

\*\*\*

Goddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.

But to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?

So where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592).  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.

Anyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):

*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*

We’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:

*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*

And now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison.

Now everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.

But even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. 

First, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. 

**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**

Now, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\_cramer\_reveals\_dirty\_tricks\_short\_sellers\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)

[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)

So where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. 

So for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?

And I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do ""because the SEC doesn't understand it."" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: 

[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.

I think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. 

Now I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. 

So maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.

In conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.

And Happy Holidays everyone.

\--CPT Hubbard

**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS. Probably even by early March, if that time is good for you (he’ll text before he comes).  And fuck infinite regress: It’s rockets all the way down here.  **🚀🚀🚀** Now: diamond hands, motherfuckers.

Have a read you all.

Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn’t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.

Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""
    
    Else
    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

# Disclaimer

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

🌈 m's banned me for a DD that was short but actually made money for those who followed it. 

Have a read you all.

Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn’t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.

Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""
    
    Else
    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

kaa2qh_GME,GME,GME Either Squeezes or Gets Delisted - Who Will Win Short or Squeeze? Predictions here,"Hello Reddit,

GME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.

**First Let's Recap**

**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**

Already was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying.

**During Earnings (12/7):**

[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

The conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?

There were two pieces of ""bad news"": ""missed revenue"" and ""shelf offering"" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Revenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Shelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used.

First comment was by Jim Bell: """"However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.""

When asked by William Reuter from BoA. ""OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?""

George Sherman responded: ""No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.""

My thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:

1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover
2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent
3. They truly want to use it as they said

My issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer.

Nonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of ""bad news"". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.

My thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.

**Post Earnings (12/9):**

A war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.

My thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.

\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).

My thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.

**What's Next?**

The moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.

1. Individuals own 9.87%
2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98%
3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 2.44%
4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million
5. Cohen net worth $600 Million

Cohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?

There are two current possibilities:

1. He conducts a hostile takeover.
2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.

Reason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**

Reason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?

I can think of two possibilities:

1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**
2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**

Now, this is interesting.

Reason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.

Reason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 22.29% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock.

My overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.

Notice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a completely different debate.

Feel free to counter-point in the comments.

k9apx5_TM,TM,GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here],"I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. 

But first take Cohen. 

Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. 

Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?

Or do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.

This is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.

EDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.  This is when things start to get interesting.

EDIT 2:  In light of recent events, I would like to amend my last two paragraphs.  I will leave the first three sentences and then conclude with the amount of credit I should have given this greedy shortsighted, dumbfuck Boomer.

""And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has.  So Sherman decides that instead of carefully considering Cohen's critiques and then bolstering his case to lead this company by buying back shares (as authorized) or giving better guidance on Q4 to possibly raise the share price and even trigger a short squeeze, delighting shareholders far and wide and even making them feel a sense of loyalty to him for it, Sherman goes for the all-too-perfect encapsulation of a Baby Boomer move: he protects himself with a totally needless shelf registration that is a transparent, weak-ass poison pill.  But one that threatens to destroy shareholder value and let the shorts off the hook should an activist investor try to get a little too cute with their operations.  Using us, the shareholders, as pawns in any possible proxy fight.  Because Fuck You, I'm George Fucking Sherman.  You'll get your Q4 numbers and I'll get my bonus and you can fuck right off.

We should all be outraged at how this was handled.  And I can guarantee you that if Cohen was contemplating a takeover or a total removal of the Board, this couldn't have gone any better for him.  The fear was likely that Sherman crushes it and we all shout the name Sherman! Sherman! from the rafters (not you Georgians probably) in exultation at our good fortune.  A shelf registration and an after hours drop in price of 17%??  Chris Davis, Cohen's attorney, must be shitting himself at his good fortune.  If Cohen moves, he is going to move quickly on this - possibly even tomorrow if the price really gets hammered.  Wishful thinking?  Yeah, possibly.  But if I had the ability to call a vote on replacement of the Board and knew that could likely trigger a massive short squeeze for a stock I own nearly 10% of?  I'd consider doing that.  Very much so.  And if I wanted to replace an inept Board and CEO, would I want him to do something that is transparently selfish and possibly destroys shareholder value?  Yeah, I fucking would.  And I would have a much easier time doing it right after almost every shareholder heard that call and thought: Fuck this Sherman guy. Which is the real thing ringing through the rafters tonight.",2020-12-08,435,156

k6ntxj_DG,DG,GME Short Squeeze: An In-depth Analysis,"Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements(if any) and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""
    
    Else
    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time.

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements(if any) and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    ""Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure"" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    ""Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze""
    
    Else If
    ""Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders""
    
    Else
    ""I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

# Disclaimer

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time. Writing this post was a good exercise for me and I decided to ride on the GME train after doing so. Before you decide to do anything, you should do your research. This is not financial advice.

k688qv_GME,GME,For Those Who Don't Understand the Inevitable Short Squeeze with GME,"First, what is a short?

The first concept to understand is you **sell** to **open**, and **buy** to **close**.

Your brokerage will lend you x amount of shares and sell them on your behalf on the market. That you is **selling** to **open** the short position.

When you cover your position you **buy** to **close** the position.   
Let's say you short GME at $15.80 for 1000 shares and the price drops to $12. You would borrow 1000 shares from your broker that are sold on the market at $15.80, you decide to close your position at $12 where you would then buy those 1000 shares at $12/share and give them back to the broker. You would profit $3.80/share so $3800.

But what if the price goes up? Well, you have **cover** that position. So if you short GME at $15.80 and it goes up to $16.20 you are already in the hole $0.40/share. 

**Key Point:** Shorting happens on a **margin** account. That means, it's not actually your money either. It's the brokerages. If you are losing enough money you will go into what is called a **house call** which essentially will force you to cover your position. 

Moral of the story, if you drive the price up, you will force short positions to either cover or double down.   
The case of GME is extremely interesting because there is over 100% short interest, meaning there are more shorts than actual volume.

THIS is what causes a short squeeze. This is also why you can't expect it to happen over night.

Short Position A might be Bob from Kentucky who has a $350,000 margin account and he shorted at 15.80, once it gets to 16.50 we wants out because he's already losing so much and it's not worth the risk.

Short Position B might be Bank of A lot of Power who has a $4BN margin account and can wait years for it to fail, so they have no need to cover their positions unless it's looking really bad long term. (Like if this Cohen thing happens)

As shorts cover their positions, they are forced to buy at a higher price than they shorted, driving the stock price up. This will lead to more short positions covering driving the price up some more, leading to more short positions doing the same. All the way up to the whales who have massive short positions. 

GME has over 100% short interest, has formed a cup and handle, and the potential Cohen takeover is right around the corner. A squeeze will happen.

Hope this helps!

EDIT:

Regarding GME specifically. The earnings call on 12/8 has two possible outcomes.

1. Cohens letters are addressed and either GME begins moving forward and meets his demands or he gets a controlling position in the company.

2. Cohens letters are ignored.

If case 2 happens there are two possible outcomes.

1. Cohen initiates a hostile takeover
2. Cohen gives up the fight and sells his shares (this is the risk of this play, every other circumstance leads to a squeeze, this one leads to the shorts winning and GME heading for the toilet, however this is unlikely, it’s not like GME wants to go out of business, so it’s very unlikely Cohen and his public letters are ignored)",2020-12-03,1202,527

Oh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.

-----

I’m back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze’s results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*

It’s currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be. And of course, as always, not financial advice. Just for bragging rights and entertainment. Here goes:

Here’s a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.

**GME Overview:**

The GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we’ve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. 

In all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I’ve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID “Hell is coming” bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.

Just a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB’s name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord and u/RoaringKitty’s YT stream).

Let’s begin.

**Act 1 - The Set Up:**

Q: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren’t they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?

A: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.

First let’s go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:

* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.

* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.

* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.

* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.

The shorts are betting on $0. 

However, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody’s they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).

So give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.

That explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they’re all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.

In case the severity of the short interest hasn’t hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. 

A true head-scratcher. 

And a worthy opponent.

But they’re wrong.

**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**

Q: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn’t this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? 

Couldn’t the shorts be right? Also, hasn’t it blown already?

A: NO AGAIN.

Let me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:

**1) Ryan Cohen**

Iron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.

This guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.

In other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He’s as crazy and as smart as they come.

He also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he’s not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He’s setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). 

Either way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.

Otherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)’s ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.

One more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. 


**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**


Dr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: 

- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000

- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000

- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000


Hestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.


Cpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he’s doing.


Reggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.


**3) Bond repurchase**
	
GME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.

Secondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody’s to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.

This is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.

Very underplayed story here.


**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**

> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. 

> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).

> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.
Compare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.
The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. 

> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.
So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

JeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don’t agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.



**5) Product Mix**

GameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that’s the narrative.

GIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.

**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**

This is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.

Instead, think of any other market bubble. It’s simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).

So instead, think of Burry’s 2008 MBS trade, Ackman’s 2020 COVID trade, PTJ’s Black Monday Trade, or Chanos’ Enron trade. 

Same thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.

And oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.


**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn’t that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody’s credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don’t know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).”

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn’t even be considered an euphoric price with today’s growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here’s my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

If I missed anything, comment and I will update above. I’m aiming to make this the final stop for all high-level GME DD.

*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.

Oh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.

I’m back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze’s results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*

It’s currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be. And of course, as always, not financial advice. Just for bragging rights and entertainment. Here goes:

Here’s a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.

**GME Overview:**

The GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we’ve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. 

In all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I’ve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID “Hell is coming” bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.

Just a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB’s name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord and u/RoaringKitty’s YT stream).

Let’s begin.

**Act 1 - The Set Up:**

Q: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren’t they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?

A: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.

First let’s go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:

* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.

* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.

* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.

* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.

The shorts are betting on $0. 

However, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody’s they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).

So give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.

That explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they’re all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.

In case the severity of the short interest hasn’t hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. 

A true head-scratcher. 

And a worthy opponent.

But they’re wrong.

**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**

Q: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn’t this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? 

Couldn’t the shorts be right? Also, hasn’t it blown already?

A: NO AGAIN.

Let me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:

**1) Ryan Cohen**

Iron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.

This guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.

In other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He’s as crazy and as smart as they come.

He also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he’s not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He’s setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). 

Either way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.

Otherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)’s ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.

One more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. 


**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**


Dr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: 

- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000

- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000

- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000


Hestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.


Cpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he’s doing.


Reggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.


**3) Bond repurchase**
	
GME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.

Secondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody’s to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.

This is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.

Very underplayed story here.


**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**

> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. 

> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).

> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.
Compare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.
The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. 

> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.
So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

JeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don’t agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.



**5) Product Mix**

GameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that’s the narrative.

GIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.

**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**

This is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.

Instead, think of any other market bubble. It’s simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).

So instead, think of Burry’s 2008 MBS trade, Ackman’s 2020 COVID trade, PTJ’s Black Monday Trade, or Chanos’ Enron trade. 

Same thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.

And oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.


**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn’t that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody’s credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don’t know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).”

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn’t even be considered an euphoric price with today’s growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here’s my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn’t that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody’s credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don’t know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).”

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn’t even be considered an euphoric price with today’s growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here’s my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.

Ryan Cohen is not an investor, he is an executive with experience building a company to dominate its local market. GameStop is such a company with dominance in this market. He is looking to replicate his Chewy success here. Why else would he be going into a board negotiation with a mergers attorney?

**Chewy and GameStop**

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#20f4e9825579](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#20f4e9825579)

From the article linked at the top:

*Since leaving Chewy, Cohen has been looking at investments, both public and private, but hasn't yet seen, or come up with, an idea as good as Chewy.*

*""Sometimes the best strategy is just to be patient and wait for that,"" he said.*

*Now, a decade later, after selling Chewy for 3.35 billion, and exiting the company, Cohen is still thinking about the best way to beat Amazon.*

*It’s harder now, he says, but still possible.*

*And the best idea to bet on could be the one that everyone says can’t possibly succeed.* 

Since GameStop is a Delaware company he only needs to get over 50% in order to force a merger. He is unlikely to get over 50%, however, seeing as the number of funds holding GameStop currently is very high. 

(see [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional)) 

Cohen’s best course of action is to negotiate with GameStop’s Board of Directors and agree on a price to be presented for a vote to shareholders. This action would also probably force this squeeze, because institutions would call in shares for voting. This may even fund Cohen’s entire purchase of GameStop. 

Imagine if Cohen successfully negotiates an offer, then Blackrock and Vanguard will have to call in their shares, starting this squeeze in earnest.",2020-10-01,36,25

du6tgm_GME,GME,Long GME (Gamestop) - Feedback Appreciated :),"I’ll try to express my core points about GME – feel free to critique any of my conclusions / statements. Hopefully my analysis has provided some evidence that the mean value is around  $10-$20 per share. I'll start by explaining the progression to the mispricing of $6.09 today from a more reasonable $12-$15 earlier this year.

Gamestop hired Perella Weinburg to explore sale w/ Apollo and Sycamore as two main suitors in early 2019. Talks fell through as a vague statement - “GameStop’s Board has now terminated efforts to pursue a sale of the company due to the lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquiror”. This implies that Gamestop got into the final talks with Sycamore or Apollo, and one of them wasn't able to perform a leveraged buyout to the degree they expected - a small misstep which resulted to where we are at today. Note this would have been anywhere from \~$15-$20 earlier this year.

A subsequent removal of their ""high yield"" dividend by the new management team (expected given their method of compensation - long-vesting options and other equity that is negatively affected by a dividend) resulted in a sharp share price drop, from $5 to a bottom of $3.21 after a tender offer with >40% proration factor. Given that Gamestop's institutional holders were full of dividend related ETF/index funds/mutual funds, this constituted a massive forced selling process, not to mention the 75% of the market cap short we have gotten to today pushing the price down (highest in the market as of October 2019).

Next, we will discuss the multitude of misconceptions that have pushed the price down and balooned the short interest

Misperception - Gamestop has a big sales problem - who shops there anymore?

Gamestop’s SG&A has been allowed to saturate above gross profit levels consistently for a full 7 year console cycle - causing operating profit compression. Since the last console release (end of 2013), Gamestop's SG&A has been allowed to bloat with corporate overhead / non-incremental expenses. Excluding double digit gross profit declines in 2017 and 2019, gamestop's gross profit has actually been flat (-1% to 5% annually).

Misperception: SSS / Preowned Declines Will Flip Margins

Gamestop’s New Management is aggressively cutting unprofitable (\~5-10%) stores, and taking advantage of the short term lease profile discussed later. SG&A & Operational Efficiencies of 200m by the end of 2020 exploited widen the operating profit margin from 12.8% to 24.3%. This is very achievable by mgmt considering they have completed 40m out of 100m guided in their first quarter (Q3) and guided up this level to 200m by the end of 2020. Late Stage in 10 year console cycle & confirmation of disk drive in both big console releases next year will stave off gross profit declines temporarily.

Misperception: Gamestop is the next Blockbuster

BlockBuster was saddled with high interest debt, maturing in 2009/2010 (900m), and were unable to refinance during the financial crisis. BlockBuster also had razor thin margins and high interest payments well before their bankruptcy in 2010. Despite aggressively cutting SG&A, store count only fell from \~9000 to \~6500, suggesting long operating lease durations prevented a more rapid scale-down.

As stated by the former Blockbuster CEO - ""With $350 million in debt that was due in the first quarter of 2009. It was something Keyes wasn’t worried about because he was planning to refinance the debt at a later date. But now, with banks unwilling to lend, and nervous movie studios changing their credit terms from 90 days to cash, Blockbuster had only one option."" Note: Gamestop instead has a net cash position!

Misperception: Radioshack is the next Blockbuster

Radioshack did not close stores with \~4300 stores in the U.S. in 2015 and in some instances 25 in a 25 mile radius (Sacramento, CA). This is due to a poor loan with strict covenants on closing stores. Extreme management issues, considering 7 CEO changes from 2005-2014 with aggressive marketing & reinventing spend for each new charlatan. 6.8 m in executive comp in 2009. SG&A stayed flat to up despite rapidly declining gross profit, no cyclical aspect of their business decline (like the console cycle with Gamestop).Indemnification Contracts removed accountability from the new management teams, and made them poor stewards of Radioshack investors' capital.

Misperception: Xbox Live / Playstation Store (Streaming) Risk

Digital Games are already a well-baked in trend, but there are structural discounts to buying physical -> resale value / unique offerings. Furthermore, multiple studies show that >60% of console gamers prefer buying physical. For example, FIFA 20 retails at $60, and FIFA 19 has a $9 value on Gamestop trade-in or $12 on eBay (structurally higher due to the time/cost requirement of packaging and shipping on the part of the seller). Since next years FIFA 21 should yield a similar trade-in value for FIFA 20, this presents a 15-20% structural discount in buying physical, and redeeming the game upon the next release.

Gamestop is wisely praying on exclusive digital items with their new management team, like the ""Fornite Merry Mint Pickaxe"" with epic rarity, requiring consumers to go to a Gamestop location and purchase a collectible (driving same store sales). This move presents a large opportunity, and has been also repeated with a ""Free Legendary Shiny Pokemon"" for Pokemon Sun and Moon and 3 free Cowboys Madden Ultimate Team players in Madden 20.

Another common statement by short investors - ""I haven't been to Gamestop in forever - they must have fallen into irrelevancy"". Nevertheless, Gamestop still holds 36.3% of console sales in the U.S. with 2.725 B out of a 7.5 B market. Although this market share is not suggestive of a moat - it is interesting to see how consumer's have still chosen Gamestop despite the long-ingested trend of Amazon & rival retailers such as Best Buy entering this near-commodity space.

Additionally, weak numbers such as a 40% drop in hardware sales seem to only lend fault to Gamestop vs. their competitors. A quick look at statistica's useful charts on PS4 and Xbox One sales show a severe freeze-up in these console sales since Dec 2018 - a similar effect to what we saw in 2013 before these consoles were released. Consumers tend to stop buying consoles once they hear a new console release is within a year in horizon - in this case Xbox Scarlett 5 - both confirmed in Holiday 2020 (also both have disc drives!!!). We've seen this rapid cyclicality before, but the market thinks it's all secular this time around.

Gamestop's management has hinted at an almost complete closure of their international stores (>1200), with direct rumors of closings in the entire Greater-Nordic region this year (\~300 stores) and further evidence in their most recent conference call. Digging into their Milan, Italy and Brisbane, Australia distribution facilities, both could fetch \~97.8 per square foot (the price Blackstone is paying on average), indicating that the sale of these facilities could provide Gamestop with another 30m in cash.

Management also seems very promising - sticking to their word in cutting SG&A aggressively as many activists have urged. They are already about 20% completed (as per conference call) of a 200m sg&a overhead cut, a seemingly routine operation for George Sherman. Digging into conference calls at his time in Advanced Auto Parts, the stock rallied almost 142% during his tenure due to a laser-focus on operating profit goals - stating that he will ""chop"" intently to meet targets.

New operating lease standards force Gamestop to put >700 m of new ""debt"" onto their balance sheet, forcing EV numbers up and causing retail / systematic selling from investors using formulas/multiples blindly. Confusion around EV seems to permeate through VIC / seeking alpha. Nevertheless, the average operating lease duration is only 2 years, and mandatory lease payments following an almost exponential distribution. The real question is should this ""debt"" with zero incremental interest payments (already included on the income statement) and a 2 year duration be treated as debt? I would disagree, especially considering the store closures we will see from management and the fact that these ""operating lease debts"" resemble accounts payable rather than long-term debt.

Additionally, most of the big/popular console games are very demanding in download size - try 92 GB for read dead redemption 2. Many consumers either don't want to wait for that mega-download on their console or simply don't have the bandwidth.

Gamestop also has a massive short squeeze opportunity. With >400 m in cash at the bottom of their working capital cycle, 75% short interest (short shares / shares outstanding), and a volatile >30% cost to borrow which peaked over 100% on interactive brokers for some periods. An existing 237m auth may be being employed as we speak, but with a meager 550m market cap, this presents a massive opportunity for management if they play their cards right. I have faith, given they already employed a dutch-auction tender offer and it aligns with their incentives to employ their buyback plan aggressively, and have already stated and acted as they will not blow away their cash.

Finally, the recent offers for Vitamin Shoppe and Chico's (two low-margin retailers with similar store profiles) both resulted in 10, 11% FCF yields per store respectively. Note: this is eerily similar to a $20 per share for GME offer that could have been fulfilled earlier this year by Sycamore / Apollo at a 11% FCF yield per store. Although the Chico's offer was turned down by management, a $20 offer today would make the stock a 3.3x today - even so the news has been relatively good this year - for example consoles were confirmed to have disk drives and come out in Holiday 2020.

I hope this provides more clarity on GME - even very conservative DCFs yield around a $7.5 per share outcome without the short-squeeze hypothesis (10% discount rate, small improvement in FCF due to console release, then 20% gross profit declines thereafer). I'm not trying to say Gamestop will make a great comeback, but a measured decline (unlike the behaviors of Radioshack's management) will be extremely accretive to the equity holders today.

Catalysts:

Share Repurchases (237 m authorization, 63 m of which was already used in a dutch-auction tender offer)

Short Squeeze (highest short interest in the market, high cost of borrowing emerging)

Buyout (Revisited by Apollo / Sycamore or some megafund alternative)

Rebound in 2020 due to the new console releases driving not only hardware but software sales

Fulfillment of SG&A cuts trickling down to earnings

If they're trading at a significant discount from their book value per share, and their retained earning have increased for the past four years. 2018's book value saw a small drop off. Their dividend yield seems unsustainable and the cash could go to better use for operations or investments. I may open a position based on them trading well below their book value per share. I calculated their CAGR and I got 26.66% for the years 2013-2018. Which seems like horseshit but that's what I got. Someone feel free to correct me on this stuff.

80s7d2_AMZN,AMZN,GME has a few puffs left,"GameStop is very cheap on an earnings multiple basis and also a dying business that nobody wants to invest in. 

With their most recent 8-K, GameStop reaffirmed their guidance for 2018 EPS hitting around the middle of $3.10-$3.40, *without factoring in the tax bill*. GME pays an effective tax rate of 32%, and lowering this to a conservative estimate of 20% we can estimate EPS of $3.67-$4.03 with a midpoint of $3.85. I can't predict earnings, but the positive tailwinds of the continued shortage for Nintendo Switch and the success of newer Xbox One models make me optimistic, especially considering that GME gave this exact guidance range last year and cruised comfortably over the top.

GME has an AT&T-store business which I'm not too excited about, and I'm a bit worried that their guidance of $80-$95M operating contribution, about $10-$25M lower than 2016, is optimistic solely based on the fact that they have missed their estimates badly in the past. It makes some amount of sense that GME wants to leverage their SG&A by growing their footprint; good luck to them(it also makes their numbers look better, but they go into enough detail that you can figure out exactly what the impact is).

When you look at the core business, things amazingly don't look so bad. The used disc business represents the largest segment of gross profit contribution to the business, about 30% of gross profit. In 2016, GME managed to sell about $2.2B worth of used games, earning a $1B gross profit. Over the past 10 years, the most they ever sold was $2.6B of used games(in 2012), earning a $1.2B gross profit. In other words, over the past 6 years, GME has lost about $200M in gross profit and seen this segment decline less than 3% per annum while gross margins slid .3%. Over that same time frame, total gross profit in the core business has slid by about $174M, even after margin contribution of $200M or so from an entirely new segment, ""collectibles."" 

It's important to think about where we are in the console cycle, with the Nintendo Switch shortage driving foot traffic into the stores, and likely with it, sales of collectibles, accessories, exclusive offers, and new discs. Reduced console sales pushing down sales of their higher-margin goods like collectibles and accessories may be the greatest threat on the downside.

Factors on the upside include Xbox expanding backwards-compatibility for old games, which potentially increases the value of GME's inventory and drives resurgence in their used game business. In addition, collectibles are a bright spot and growing quickly, although still a small contributor to bottom line.

If you just chart net income for GME by year over the past 10 years, there's no major deterioration in earning power that's apparent; it looks pretty flat(it's helped by debt-financed acquisitions). EPS, on the other hand, is not far from all-time highs for the business, with the difference due to buybacks. GME has their dividend and interest payments fully covered by cash flow, and I'm not too worried. 

In summary, you have a stock trading at 4x forward earnings and 5x forward EV/EBIT, where it seems that the market is pricing in an imminent collapse of the business that I do not believe will materialize. And fundamentally, I think AMZN is a threat to every retailer; but when you're trading at a 5x forward multiple you have less far to fall, and infinite upside. ",2018-02-28,18,67
