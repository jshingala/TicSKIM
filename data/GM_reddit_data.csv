1kc5mfa_GM,GM,GM Lowers Guidance on Tariffs,"General Motors Co. lowered its full-year profit outlook, just two days after suspending earnings guidance, citing exposure to as much as $5 billion in auto tariffs being levied by President Donald Trump.

The company said it now expects earnings before interest and taxes to fall into a range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion, down from its initial guidance in January of as much as $15.7 billion. The reason, according to a letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, is the company‚Äôs exposure to tariffs.

GM‚Äôs lowered guidance comes even after Trump issues what he‚Äôs characterized as relief for automakers by lowering some levies on imported vehicles and parts. Even so, GM expects a hit to its profits this year unless trade deals are cut with key automotive trading partners that would reduce the automaker‚Äôs exposure.

Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday that reduced his initial tariffs on vehicles and parts. The first executive order gave vehicles a reprieve from separate tariffs on aluminum and steel, so levies and parts and metals wouldn‚Äôt be compounded.

He also changed the 25% tariff on imported auto parts that takes effect on May 3. Carmakers who produce and sell completed automobiles in the US can claim an offset worth up to 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.

That offset will reduce in one year to as much as 2.5% of the value of those cars, and then be eliminated the following year. The offset will be available for cars that were produced after April 3.

Automakers still face a 25% duty on imported vehicles, which hurts GM because it makes several popular models in Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The company has a plant each in Canada and Mexico making its profitable and top-selling pickup trucks. Its most affordable models, the Chevrolet Equinox family SUV and Chevy Trax compact SUV, are also made outside the US.

The company has been working to reduce its exposure to tariffs to keep the entire $5 billion in exposure from cutting profits. One move: Raising pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana to meet demand with fewer trucks that are hit with tariffs.

GM said on April 29 that it beat Wall Street estimates with a profit of $2.78 a share, but profits fell due to lower truck production and foreign exchange costs. 

The company also moved to preserve cash by holding off on $4 billion in planned share buybacks. During the quarter, GM cut capital spending in the quarter by $900 million to $1.8 billion. GM shares are down more than 4% since it announced first-quarter profits.",2025-05-01,163,28

GM reported 2024 sales of more than 2.7 million vehicles, up 4.3% from a year earlier. The automaker sold 2.9 million units in 2019.

‚ÄúThe driving force for our business is new vehicles with great design and performance across our portfolio, helping our dealers satisfy more customers. We‚Äôre carrying significant momentum into 2025,‚Äù Rory Harvey, GM president of global markets, said in a release.

Ford on Friday reported 2024 sales of 2.08 million vehicles, up from just under 2 million in 2023. In 2019, the automaker sold 2.42 million vehicles in the U.S. For the fourth quarter, Ford reported an 8.8% year-over-year increase in sales to 530,660 vehicles sold.

That automaker said full-year sales of its vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines increased 0.2% compared to 2023, while sales of electrified vehicles increased 38.3% year over year.

Electrified vehicles, including hybrids and EVs, represented 13.7% of Ford‚Äôs total annual sales.

1h560u4_GM,GM,GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors¬†plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that‚Äôs anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM‚Äôs move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty¬†regarding federal incentives¬†for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect¬†Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES¬†rival Samsung SDI.

‚ÄúWe believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,‚Äù GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. ‚ÄúWhen completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that‚Äôs nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.‚Äù‚ÄØ

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people,¬†was expected to begin operating¬†by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we‚Äôre taking an important step towards these goals,‚Äù Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its¬†flat ‚ÄúUltium‚Äù pouches¬†to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

1ew44xn_GM,GM,"GM lays off more than 1,000 salaried software and services employees","General Motors is set to lay off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally within its software and services division as part of an effort to streamline operations. The layoffs, which include approximately 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come after a comprehensive review aimed at optimizing the company's resources in this crucial sector. These cuts represent about 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce, which totaled 76,000 at the end of last year. The decision underscores the automaker's ongoing efforts to align its workforce with its evolving business strategy.

The timing of these layoffs is notable, as they come less than six months after significant leadership changes in the division. Mike Abbott, a former Apple executive who was brought on as GM‚Äôs first executive vice president of software in May 2023, left the company in March due to health reasons. Following his departure, Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson stepped in to lead the division. Cetinok, a seasoned software executive, now oversees product management, program management, and design, while Richardson leads software engineering, focusing on areas like embedded platforms, digital products, and advanced driver-assistance systems such as GM‚Äôs Super Cruise.

GM's move to reduce its software and services workforce is part of a broader industry trend where automakers are looking to cut costs amid concerns of an economic downturn, while simultaneously investing heavily in emerging markets such as electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. The software and services division at GM covers a wide range of areas, including infotainment systems, the OnStar brand, and new ventures like subscription services. As the automotive industry increasingly focuses on monetizing software, these layoffs may signal a shift in how GM plans to prioritize its investments and resources going forward.

1dtvicm_GM,GM,GM reports best U.S. quarterly sales since 2020 ,"General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.

Its EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.

Sales of GM‚Äôs full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.

GM‚Äôs total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.

GM‚Äôs second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.

An unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.

‚ÄúThe CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,‚Äù said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds‚Äô head of insights.

GM, in a statement, said its ‚Äúdealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.‚Äù

Dealers, including the industry‚Äôs largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.

All six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six ‚Äî Asbury Automotive Group, AutoNation Inc., Group 1 Automotive Inc., Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. ‚Äî use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.  

‚ÄúThe good news is ‚Äî unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past ‚Äî sales shouldn‚Äôt be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,‚Äù Caldwell said.

Separately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company‚Äôs U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.

The Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.

Kia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.

Calls on FSD.","For anyone unaware, as of last week Cruise has indefinitely halted all of their driverless robotaxis nationwide after a slew of issues (accidents, blocking emergency service workers, parking in front of fire hydrants, unsafe driving near pedestrians) culminated in one of their cars running over a woman and dragging her body for 20 feet before stopping.

https://www.wired.com/story/gms-cruise-halts-self-driving-operations-regulator-safety-fears/

This comes on the heels of their promise for rapid expansion across the US from the apparent ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of their pilot programs. 

Now that investigators are involved, we‚Äôre seeing how deep of a scam they were running to convince people they were market leaders in autonomous driving. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html

> Half of Cruise‚Äôs 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle. The workers intervened to assist the company‚Äôs vehicles every 2.5 to five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations. In other words, they frequently had to do something to remotely control a car after receiving a cellular signal that it was having problems.

In essence, Cruise‚Äôs ‚Äúautonomous vehicles‚Äù required remote assistance from a human to take control every 2-5 miles. On average, that means human pilots were required multiple times per passenger trip. That‚Äôs a fairly stark difference from what they were reporting a few years ago, where they claimed each car could drive 12,000+ miles before the autonomous system needed to be disengaged:

https://www.ttnews.com/articles/new-autonomous-mileage-reports-are-out-data-meaningful

GM has already dumped $10B+ into Cruise, and it seems fairly apparent the company‚Äôs tech is on par with Nikola rolling their EV truck down a hill (who were oddly enough yet another shoddy GM partner lol..). While Waymo is still operating at present, their vehicles have been reportedly experiencing many of the same issues. Regulators have lost trust in this tech, and will be rolling out stricter requirements and oversight. 

What‚Äôs the play? Tesla FSD imo is going to be what most of legacy auto turns to. They‚Äôve banked more than 1000x the number of road hours of every other driverless company combined. Their accidents and incidents per mile are a fraction of a fraction of what Waymo and Cruise are reporting. I‚Äôm only holding shares, as we‚Äôre still many years away from nation-wide autonomous cars imo. But this news is concrete proof of what many have been speculating for years. These ‚ÄúL4‚Äù autonomous driving companies are full of it. They‚Äôre glorified trains on virtual tracks that are constantly being remotely operated by humans.

Long puts on GM are also probably a smart move at this point.",2023-11-04,410,186
17e4n7r_PATH,PATH,Is GM a good long term buy?,"I want to preface this by saying that I have NEVER (okay, maybe in my first year investing I bought some FORD stock) bought any automotive stocks, because of the narrative driven by many investors who are infinitely better at investing than me that people should completely stay away from the automotive industry. With that being said, I have been doing a lot of research on GM and from what I‚Äôm seeing it looks like it is trading at a massive discount. 

GM is trading at a 4.14 PE, .58 price to book (I know there have been some bankruptcy concerns with GM, but that PB ratio suggest that the stock would actually go up significantly if they declared bankruptcy) and a .24 price/sales (low margin business, I get it). GM just hit an ATH in revenue (~170 Billion), as well as an ATH in operating income (11.1 Billion), as well having about $60 billion more in assets than liabilities, and ~33 Billion cash in hand/short term investments.

The multiples are lower than historical norms, which suggest that the market anticipates that this company is declining, but the financials suggest that they are still growing.

I believe that because the automotive industry is more or less a zero sum game (most people only have 1 vehicle) and folks are so high on Tesla, as well as short term supply chain issues and hysteria about the economy that GM (and some other automakers) are being written off. 

I don‚Äôt believe in the narrative that Tesla is going to take >33% of market share in the coming years (I don‚Äôt think they ever become the highest market share auto company, but even if they eventually did, they wouldn‚Äôt have a path to doing so until ~2027, and I do believe that the supply chain issues and the issues with the economy are temporary.

General Motors will offer voluntary buyouts to a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of its U.S. white-collar employees, as it aims to cut $2 billion in structural costs over the next two years, according to a letter sent to workers Thursday from CEO Mary Barra. The ‚ÄúVoluntary Separation Program,‚Äù or VSP, comes after the Detroit automaker said last week it would terminate about 500 salaried positions globally.

General Motors handily beat Wall Street‚Äôs top- and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter, while forecasting another solid year of results in 2023.

The strong report suggests GM is hanging onto record, or near-record, results even as the U.S. automotive industry begins to normalize after several years of record-low inventories and resilient consumer demand.

Here‚Äôs how GM performed to close out last year, compared with analysts‚Äô estimates as compiled by Refinitiv:
Adjusted earnings per share: $2.12 vs. $1.69 expected
Revenue: $43.11 billion vs. $40.65 billion expected

The fourth-quarter results easily topped a year earlier, when the automaker reported an adjusted EPS of $1.35 and revenue of $33.58 billion for the final three months of 2021.

GM‚Äôs full-year 2022 revenue came in at $156.7 billion, with net income attributable to stockholders of $9.9 billion and adjusted earnings before interest and tax at a record $14.5 billion. Those results marked the high-end of the company‚Äôs previously revised guidance.

Still, the automaker is showing signs of a margin squeeze. GM‚Äôs net income slipped last year, down by less than 1% from full-year 2021 to $9.9 billion, with a profit margin that was off 1.6 percentage points to 6.3%. Its adjusted profit margin was 9.2%, down 2.1 percentage points compared with the previous year.

GM said it incurred special charges in the fourth quarter of $511 million related to a buyout program for its Buick dealers and $657 million related to shuttering its limited operation in Russia.

For 2023, GM expects net income attributable to stockholders of between $8.7 billion and $10.1 billion. It expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of between $6 and $7.

Those results would be below 2022 earnings, but above average analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitv that called for EPS of $5.73 this year.

GM forecast 2023 net automotive cash from operating activities to come in between $16 billion and $20 billion and sees automotive free cash flow of $5 billion to $7 billion.

Wall Street has been bracing for a ‚Äúdemand destruction‚Äù scenario for the last several quarters, with some analysts suggesting automakers may need to execute cost-cutting measures to offset recessionary spending shifts.

Demand and pricing for GM‚Äôs vehicles ‚Äúremain strong,‚Äù CFO Paul Jacobson told reporters Tuesday morning. He said GM is being ‚Äúappropriately cautious‚Äù but vehicle inventories remain constrained amid strong demand.

‚ÄúWe think the underlying business is going to be pretty consistent with what we saw last year, and I think that‚Äôs a slightly more bullish statement than where most of the market is,‚Äù he said.

Following recent price cuts for Tesla vehicles and Ford‚Äôs Mustang Mach-E crossover, Jacobson said GM feels its EVs ‚Äúare well positioned‚Äù with pricing. GM‚Äôs EVs currently range from the mid-$20,000 Chevrolet Bolt models to the more than $100,000 Hummer vehicles.

GM will execute a $2 billion cost-cutting plan through the next two years, according to Jacobson. Up to half of those savings are expected this year, he said. GM expects some head count reduction due to attrition but the company is ‚Äúnot planning layoffs,‚Äù Jacobson said.",2023-01-31,55,26
10qdati_GM,GM,GM Claims to Have Set EPS Records in Q4: But What About the Company Being Cash Flow Positive?,"GM reported $43b in quarterly revenue in Q4 2022 and $2b in net income.  On paper, these numbers look good but is the company really profitable and sustainable?  The last time it reported losses was in FY 2017.  Its income statement looks good and its net income margin is around 5-6% the last 5 years.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gm-cfo-earnings-set-another-170414107.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gm-cfo-earnings-set-another-170414107.html)

The problem is the cash flow statement.  The last time GM was FCF+ was in 2013.  It's averaging $25b in capex each year or about 15-20% of annual revenue.  The incoming revenue means nothing if the company needs that much capex to sustain itself.  So how has GM been sustaining itself?  Through leverage:  GM's debt increased from $17b in 2012 to $112b in 2020.  In the process, GM's cap structure has become 2/3 debt and 1/3 market equity: that's not including pension liabilities of $12.4b.  If you include all these, GM really has a sliver of equity in its invested capital base.

Now GM does have a huge cash chest of $30.3b and long-term investments of $9.9b.  What that means is out of GM's stock price of $39, $28 is accounted for by these two.  Wall Street is assigning only $11.5 out of $39 to GM's core businesses, which includes the EV business GM is aggressively pursuing.

So this is the issue with GM: it's profitable but consistently reports negative FCF, which translates to the company resorting to debt to fund its operations.  Given its high cash level, GM can continue to do this until it has to refinance.  However, its $25b in capex is eating up too much revenue and is not covered by retained earnings.  Compare GM to Tesla, which is both profitable and FCF+.

So what do you really think about GM, aside from the supposedly ""stellar earnings"" it reported. Based on its full financials, GM has considerable issues it has to deal with.",2023-01-31,5,11

GM has a workforce centered in North America, which makes is insulated from a lot of geopolitical uncertainty.  

They will soon be mass producing electric vehicles which will likily get them a lot of press. 

They pay a dividend.

The average cost of a car has skyrocketed so they should make larger profits.

CONS 
Margins are tight in automotive and tooling expensive so revenue can be eaten up quick.

GM made bad financial decisions during the GFC and that could happen again.

Supply chains may be disrupted or input materials could skyrocket against.

DETROIT ‚Äì The CEOs of General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler parent Stellantis and Toyota Motor North America are urging Congress to lift the federal government‚Äôs cap on the number of vehicles that are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500, a move they say will encourage consumer adoption of the cars and trucks.

In a joint letter Monday to congressional leaders, the executives say the credit, which begins phasing out once a company sells 200,000 plug-in electric vehicles, is essential to keep the vehicles affordable as production and commodity costs rise. 

For years, GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives with the Detroit automaker have urged that the cap to be lifted to create a level playing field. They say the current policy penalizes early adopters of the technologies.

GM owns the majority of Cruise which may be first to market next year with a commercial driverless robotaxi. If Ark invests in GM (currently $61bn market cap), this could be a major catalyst for the stock.

Here is excerpt from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-is-keeping-an-open-mind-on-investing-in-general-motors-205523879.html):

General Motors (GM) has been revving up its electric vehicle business. And Cathie Wood is taking notice.

The innovation-focused, Tesla (TSLA)-loving Ark Invest CEO ‚Äî a vocal critic of legacy automakers who predicted not long ago that GM will go bankrupt ‚Äî is changing her tune on the Detroit-based car manufacturer as it commits to an electric future, Wood signaled in an interview with Yahoo Finance. She also revealed that her investment management firm recently met with General Motors CEO Mary Barra.

‚ÄúI'm fascinated by how Mary Barra is really turning that ship around and very focused on cruise automation,‚Äù Wood said in a sit-down conversation with Yahoo Finance‚Äôs Julie Hyman.

When asked whether Ark plans to invest in GM, Wood said they are ‚Äúkeeping an open mind.‚Äù",2022-04-20,8,11

splt68_XOM,XOM,"Demand problems caused by M3 - NUE, NEM, GM, XOM, BRK and other ideas","I mentioned elsewhere I was of the opinion that the issue we face is too much money in the hands of the consumers. A debt-driven (money printed) demand problem and it's global, and entrenched. This is the source I got that from. The thing that always seems to frustrate me is that this great info is readily available, but washed out by other great analyses, and so it seems very hard to see a clear picture until events happen to confirm who was right. This is now from October 2021, but I do think we have more turmoil ahead to adjust for, so if you want to buy for safety or defense, this article may be super useful to you even though it's a bit dated now.

For me, based on this, I'm trying to get into metals, materials, production, but it's hard to get them at a good price this late in the game. A play might be NUE (Nucor). The book is decent and the P/E still low, so the possible return is high and a good amount of safety. The rest of Nucor's financials look acceptable (to me).

But not at this price. This price is the end of a momentum swing. The question for me is will a stock like NUE stay high? Or revert to mean and come down toward $110 - $114? Then it might be a buy.

If something can shock it below that, like the January selloff, then NUE looks like a great buy to hold and sell covered calls on....

NEM is another play I might want to make, but it's not as well valued, and I can't figure out if Gold is going to spike on inflation or crash on real yields going positive.

I think the Oil play is still strong and has room to grow. It's a good cash flow generator.

I think BRK is a good play going into its earnings.

I guess there are energy plays but I haven't looked at any yet. But Energy has been robust as well and is the third highest inflator behind cars then oil.

GM is my car play and I made 5% off it already and am still able to sell calls on it, so will keep pumping cash flow from my GM play - so I still think naysayers are not understanding what GM is now offering and are confusing its 5+ year history with its recent less than 5 year past transition.

sn2ung_MS,MS,GM - is it a buy?,"***UPDATE*** \- I bought GM at $47.93. I reasoned the following:

* Morgan Stanley has a conflict of interest to short its clients - therefore its downgrade at such a STRONG support level seemed to be self-interested, MS is probably buying a lot of GM right now.
* Relatively high volume compared to today's index volumes (1/1 average vs. 1/3rd average for indices) proves that sentiment.
* GM was at a support level, down 5% pushed it deep into wick territory showing strong buying pressure which is what I waited for.
* The following stock analysis suggests that basically $1 paid for GM buys $1 of GM, the book value per share is almost 1.00 and it had as low of a P/E intraday as $7.10, incredible.
* Given the management team now, and the changes they implemented, the repayment of debts, the lower cost of revenue. GM just seemed too tasty below $48 to pass-up.
* I'll be eager to see how this plays out and let  you all know gain/loss.

GM is at a technical support level that goes back a year, which I think represents an accumulation phase.

GM Pros:

* Increased earnings
* Increased Book Value
* Increased revenues
* Increased Return on Invested Capital

GM Cons:

* Cut dividends
* Negative FCF

**GM's P/E\*P/B = 8.56**

Basically - GM appears to be in a condition where it's largely been punished by reputation and not by results, since it was a huge recipient of bailouts, had large debt issues.

But lately, current debt is decreasing, current assets is increasing.

[https://roic.ai/company/GM](https://roic.ai/company/GM)

Compared to competitors such as F it looks to be in a stronger position.

Because it's near a technical support it seems to match a lot of criteria for a buy, where if it continues to meet headwinds it will lose less share price as it compresses against support, assuming it doesn't break support.

**Questions:**

Why the negative free cash flow? I'm not sure why its cash flow is seemingly negative.

It looks like a lot of it is debt repayment while GM is not selling assets (instead it's acquiring assets?) so it seems that the negative FCF, while not a pro, is at least not representative of something worse?",2022-02-07,15,62

I‚Äôve confirmed w family and friends that other local dealers and a few out of state have close or equal to zero new cars on the lot also. 

I‚Äôve talked to a few of my customers and they have to drive out of state to find new 2,500‚Äôs and when they do they get 1 to choose from. And yes they are marked up 20% but still. How can they be profitable at this point?

s38cq8_GM,GM,What do you think of GM?,"I don't know if they're going to win the EV race, or at least beat Ford, but I'm certain they'll be one of the top companies.

But even regardless of that, I just don't know how the current stock price makes any sense. I think Ford is, at least for the next few years, probably primed to overtake them in the EV race - I don't think they'll absolutely crush them, but I do think Ford is better positioned. But Ford's market cap is $100B, their P/E is 35, and their EPS is .71. GM's market cap is $90b, their P/E is 8.32, and their EPS is **7.47.**

Again, Ford seems to be better positioned, but even if Ford does reasonably better within the next few years I find the disparity in the figures above hard to reconcile. I just don't know how Ford justifies a multiple of 35 but GM only 8. I mean even at double their current share price it would seem undervalued relative to Ford, even if Ford does better over the next few years.

I guess this revolves around the question of what a fair P/E is (given that these are profitable, well established companies I think P/E is a fair metric) for an established ICE manufacturer. But the existing disparity between these ratios seems unjustifiable to me. I also think it matters that GM has considerably higher rates of institutional ownership than Ford (80% v 51%). 

The market seems to be ignoring that a better company doesn't make a better buy. ",2022-01-13,12,47

Ok, listen apes, let‚Äôs just put $TSLA aside for the sake of this argument as it is an outliner and I‚Äôm not saying $F nor $GM should be given a valuation similar to $TSLA. It‚Äôs obvious they can‚Äôt as they don‚Äôt have king Elon.

Today, Rivian just went public (Nov 11th) and jump from $78 to over $100 per share valuing the company over $85B. It is worth more than $F ($77B) and as much as $GM($86B).  Even $LCID ($65B) is almost as valuable as $F. Yet, Rivian (and $LCID)  is operating at a loss, sold way less EVs than these two legacy auto companies, yet wallstreets are giving them a way higher and richer valuation than these two.

So what‚Äôs gives?  It appear wallstreets are not interested in their boring and old internal combustion engine (ICE) products, no matter how profitable they are.  As long as ICE are lumped into EVs, $F and $GM can never be seen as a tech and/or growth company as ICE is old technology. Since ICE currently generates the bulk of its revenue and profit, this makes it really hard (and confusing) for wallstreet to see them as a tech company to give it a higher valuation.  Therefore, to exponentially unlock hundreds of billions of dollars from these two, they need to be spun off, or split from their parent company. As you probably know by now, $GE is beginning to realize that and is planning to split in 3 after a couple decades of being a one-size fit all giant.  United Technologies split up a while back to become Otis, Carrier and Raytheon (through merger) and the sum of these 3 surely worth more than they are combined. 

**So How?**

Take $GM as an example.  Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Adam Jonas once describe what he call ‚ÄúSPACtopus‚Äù (see image below) and how he believed if GM spin off any of these divisions, they‚Äôll have discrete value and perhaps worth more separately.  ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html))

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t2uwsav9xvy71.jpg?width=705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47a1a737f5129f7f8a814e04a86ebd930bdd2b89

Obviously, the Cruise and EV/Ultium divisions at least would be given a higher valuation as they would be considered a growth tech.  As long as legacy businesses are lump in with the tech it is too hard for wallstreet to value the company as a whole.

The stand-alone EV division of $GM and  $F  SHOULD be worth more than Rivian. Now since even if $GM or$F spin off their EV division, this separate division will likely operate as a loss. So it would be hard to compare and value them with Rivian (also operating as a loss) on EPS. How about if we value them based on their sales or backlog of orders to show growth? After all, growth is what companies get reward for on wallstreets.

Now for comparison sake, let's consider $F EV division only (excluding ICE, financial, etc) and Rivian.  Rivian  delivered so far.. 50? 60? trucks and have backlog order of 55,000 trucks + 100,000 Amazon vans.  $F have already delivered over 47,000 Mustang Mach E  EV to date and last month sold over 2,800+ Mache E.  Then there are 160,000+ pre-order/backlog for the F-150 Lightning and an unknown sold out number of electric Transit Connect.

Based on the numbers of EV deliveries and backlog orders alone (forget about profit/revenue for now as both are likely to be unprofitable for the time being), without question $F EV as a stand alone company will be worth more than Rivian.  And on top of that all the other divisions of $F are just icing on the cake. As ridiculous as it may sound, $F EV division as a stand alone is worth even more than all the $F combined. Think about that for a second. Because as a combined company wallstreets find it really hard to evaluate $F growth. As a stand alone, wallstreets can see clearly how $F EV is growing compare to sat Rivian.

**The Plan to Unlock Value in $F and $GM: Pull an ‚ÄòEugine No. 1‚Äô**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html)

They do this by winning the proxy vote and elect directors/board seats who will advocate for the changes they want.  Now that Eugine No 1 has won out, $XOM has no choice but to come up with some plan to fight climate change.  Had Eugine No 1 not done this, $XOM would have not tried hard like other oil companies such as Shell or BP, going more green or investing in cleaner energies which both companies have.

So what we really need to do is pull an ‚ÄòEugine No 1‚Äô. Somehow we need to put up a proxy vote. We could, but not necessarily nominate a board member, but can put up a resolution (i.e. spin off or separate EV business) which can also be impactful.  As shareholders we are owners of the company and publicly traded companies have to report to their shareholders. If a majority of shareholders agrees, it will force the company‚Äôs hand.  

I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but if those of you apes who agree with me that both $F and $GM is a value trap, we can help to unlock shareholder values by forcing the company to do so.  $GM may be easier to force to change as $F has a voting structure in which the family owns a huge chuck of votes.  However, even if we lose the proxy vote, any news/rumors of spinning off the EV division (even if it is not going to happen) will definitely push shares higher. So it is a win-win even if we win or lose.

Now you apes have been known to do the impossible, like sending stocks that hedge funds and analysis say are worthless or a piece of shit ( $GME and $AMC ), to the moon.  We can do this, if enough apes buy shares in $F and $GM and someone proposes a spin-off on a proxy vote resolution.  If enough apes on /WSB agrees, we can make the changes and finally unlock hidden values in $F and $GM. I‚Äôm more than sure that there are a lot of other shareholders who agree, but we need an ape to pull an Engine No 1 to get the ball rolling.

Disclaimer: Blah blah and blah, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. I‚Äôm an ape with a laptop and an internet connection. No part of what I wrote should be construed as advice, and you should not take anything that is said here as investment or financial advice.

q5imxu_GM,GM,What Analysts Are Saying After $GM Investment Day (Bullish),"General Motors' investor day ""accomplished a critical first step towards re-shaping perceptions‚Äù, says Citi analyst Itay Michaeli. The analyst has ""gained meaningful conviction"" in his over $100 per share upside thesis following the event. A sum-of-the-parts approach ""leads to an even considerably higher outcome‚Äù. According to Michaeli, GM's 2030 outlook implied $17 of earnings per share with improved free cash flow conversion and a 25% revenue mix from software/new business.

RBC Capital Markets Joseph Spak reiterated an Outperform rating and $74 price target for $GM, roughly 37% upside from current levels. ‚ÄúGM likely doesn't need all these opps to exactly play out as it indicated for stock to be undervalued here.""

Credit Suisse, Dan Levy writes that GM showed investors the ""potential for growth, EV leadership, and significant revenue outside core vehicle sales."" Levy believes that the ""aggressive"" presentation showcases GM's goal to move on from its perception as a zero-growth company lagging in innovation. GM's goal to double revenue implies a tripling of earnings by 2030 which would make a case for the stock to be valued over $100 today, writes Levy. ""We believe a clear case can be made for GM stock north of $100‚Äù. Though he believes it will take some time for investors to fully underwrite the stock and maintains his price target of $75. 

Wedbush, Dan Ives said the meeting ""could turn  Street sentiment bullish‚Ä¶The Chevy Bolt recall and the broader impact from the chip shortage has cast a black cloud over the stock,"" he said.
But longer term, ""we continue to believe the broader story and investment thesis at GM is around its massive EV ambitions over the next decade,"" Ives said. Ives has a $85 price target.

GM Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the¬†ride-hailing business should¬†reach $50 billion in revenue as it ramps up operations over the next six years. Cruise is expected to start charging for rides next year¬†if it wins approval from California regulators.¬†In an investor note last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote of Cruise, ""We don‚Äôt forecast such a revenue achievement before 2038 in our model by which point we forecast a Cruise fleet of nearly 600,000¬†units with 60,000¬†miles per car, per year and $1.50 revenue per mile."" Morgan Stanley. Jonas recently reiterated an Overweight rating and $80 price target. Earlier this year, he told investors he could see $120 in an upside scenario.

Armchair analyst (me) thinks it‚Äôs going to take some real-world evidence for people to believe. For instance, seeing a successful rollout of the EV Hummer ‚Äúsuper truck‚Äù later this year, Cadillac Lyriq next spring, commercial launch of the robotaxi service and end of the Bolt recall fiasco. That being said, at 8x forward earnings, the company seemingly hasn‚Äôt been given any credit for potential growth and if I wait for all those to happen, the price move may have already happened. Therefore, I am long GM through call options expiring June 2022, January 2023, and January 2024.

pvaveh_GM,GM,$GM Bolt Buying Opportunity,"General Motors has been beaten up recently over the laughably bad situation surrounding Bolt battery fires. However, jokes aside, it may be time to slow down and take a look at the wreckage. 

The setup reminds me of Tesla in 2018 when Tesla was ramping the Model 3 and going through ‚Äúmanufacturing hell‚Äù. I got into Tesla for around $40/share (post-split). My thesis at the time was based on Cathie Woods‚Äô price target which is driven by autonomy. Coincidentally, it‚Äôs the same bull thesis behind why GM has price targets with nearly 100% upside (eg Citigroup, $90 vs current price of $52).

GM is the majority owner of Cruise, a robotaxi company that is ‚Äúquarters, not years away‚Äù from launching commercially (according to GM CEO). We can expect an update on October 6th when Cruise CEO is expected to speak at the GM investor day. GM currently operates driverless taxis in San Francisco (but does not yet charge customers due to California law), something even Tesla has not yet matched in spite of all the hype.

Even if you don‚Äôt like the brands under the GM umbrella (Corvette, Cadillac, GMC, Chevy), the math of how GM turns into a multi bagger pretty simple.. GM is valued at ~$75bn today and has a majority stake in Cruise which at its last valuation was $30bn, but could potentially go to market in an IPO for $100bn+ based on past estimates of Waymo (Cruise‚Äôs closest competitor) and Tesla‚Äôs current valuation ($775bn) which Morgan Stanley attributes roughly a third to autonomy. This is not to mention other growth initiates around EVs, Onstar Insurance, commercial fleets, China.

For the above reasons, I have bought GM calls in June 2022, January 2023, and January 2024. I think longer duration is the way to go as it may take a year or more to convince people. Like Tesla, it wasn‚Äôt until people saw the cars on the street that it really took off.",2021-09-25,5,16

I've seen quite a few posts in here and other investing subs about investing in the supply chain, and this development sounds interesting from that perspective, and how it might position GM as an ESG opportunity (if they're successful, I can personally see GM buying CTR outright).


https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37029490/gm-will-suck-lithium-from-the-salton-sea-to-make-batteries/

>So GM has just signed an innovative agreement with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to extract Lithium from superheated waters beneath the Salton Sea in the desert of Southern California.

It isn't entirely clear how effective CTR's method is, but if you take their (probably very optimistic) word for it, quoting the article:

>CTR should start lithium deliveries to GM by 2024. If the Salton Sea pans out as well as it should, the area could provide 40 percent of the world‚Äôs lithium‚Äîall of it American-made.

Bolt EUV is on the legacy battery platform (not the next gen Ultium platform which Hummer EV will use), and has estimated 250 miles of range. 

For comparison, now that the standard range Model Y has been discontinued (4 days after Bolt EUV announcement), the most affordable Model Y is the long-range model which is $59k including full self driving. Compared to the Bolt EUV Launch Edition, for the extra $15.5k (35%), you‚Äôre getting 80mi of range, AWD and it‚Äôs a Tesla.

GM has traded in a narrow range of $30 to $40 over the last 10 years. Then starting in November 2020, GM started making announcements regarding their future EV vehicles. While it is true that the current administration, California, China and the EU are making strides to increase the number of EV, the one missing element from any analysis is the fact that we are not increasing the annual number of vehicles sold (i.e. total across ICE and EV). With GM really being behind the game in EV compared to other manufacturers, their stock price is increasing because they have committed billions of dollars to retool to stay competitive, not to increase net income. As there is no projected increase in net income why the increase in price? These are emotional buys and not based on fundamentals. The stock price is not supportable as the price always comes back to fundamentals. Show me where GM is increasing market share or that the market is increasing.

* * *

General Motors Co. GM -0.88% will supply fuel cells to Nikola Corp. NKLA -7.64% for commercial trucks but will no longer take an equity stake in the startup under a stripped-down agreement, Nikola said Monday.


The electric-truck company also said it has scrapped plans to build a pickup truck named the Badger, which had been part of an earlier deal with GM outlined in September. That deal got delayed after a negative short seller‚Äôs report raised questions about the readiness of some aspects of Nikola‚Äôs business, allegations the company claimed were false and misleading.

Nikola shares were down 3.4% in premarket trading Monday. GM shares were off about 0.8%.

Under their original deal, GM was to take an 11% equity stake in the Phoenix-based startup in exchange for supplying engineering work and other services. GM also was to engineer and build an electric pickup truck for retail customers, the Badger, using the auto maker‚Äôs proprietary technology for battery-powered vehicles.

fghbf1_GM,GM,Why GM is Fucked,"GM is absolutely FUCKED, here's why:  


**Reason #1: Loss of market share to foreign competition**  
China is the world's largest auto market, and GM is one of it's larger auto producers. Sales in China for Ford and GM are already being lost to domestic Chinese companies. Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)   


**Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**  
Coronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.   
 [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)   


Manufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.  


**Reason #3: Looming Recession**  
With the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times. Also, GM has recently invested a TON of money trying to prove that it can compete in the EV market. If a downturn happens now, this could obliterate its chances of competing anytime in the near future.  


Take a look at the charts here from McKinsey on how auto manufacturing is susceptible and was hit in 2008:  [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics)

My main purpose for this is to learn about the market and experience the feelings of gaining/losing money to see if it's something I'd like to peruse more.  I would like to consider these initial investments as if they were mid to long term, say 7-20 years.

I've been eyeing the following stocks:

**T**

I like T's dividend, P/B, and current price.  However, I cannot seem to understand why their recent net cash flows are negative with the exception of 2019 Q1.  How can I research the reasons behind stats like this?

**BAC**

I like BAC's PEG ratio, and P/B, but once again am confused by negative net cash flows are negative, and why that is acceptable.  

**GM**

I like GM's ROE, PEG, and dividend but am concerned by their higher D/E.  

&#x200B;

As for ETFs, I honestly have no clue which ones to choose and why.  I understand the basics like how VYM focuses on dividends and many ETFs like VGT follow a certain sector, but how should I choose between, for example, the ETFs which follow SNP? Do I even want an ETF which follows the SNP? 

&#x200B;

Thank you for any tips related or unrelated to the information above!

http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/11/politics/donald-trump-china-taiwan/index.html

I'm afraid that this is just the beginning. Trump seems to love Russia but hate China. This interesting love triangle is a major risk for $GM and $SBUX as both are seeing increased revenues from China.

Especially with $GM, China is their biggest market. Chinese consumers are known to be highly sentimental and are known to boycott products from countries that there is negative coverage on.

Increase oil prices (which are rising more than expected) will also hurt GM's sales of its gasoline/diesel models. GM's electric vehicle expansion may be a good move, however they are selling their EVs for a loss in order to expand market share. 

$SBUX has an ambitious plan to expand their operations in China and envisions that their biggest market will be China. However, its stock price may be hit during Trump's presidency as, again, the highly sentimental Chinese citizens will launch boycott campaigns through social media and other channels.

I'm afraid that this is just the beginning. Trump seems to love Russia but hate China. This interesting love triangle is a major risk for $GM and $SBUX as both are seeing increased revenues from China.

Especially with $GM, China is their biggest market. Chinese consumers are known to be highly sentimental and are known to boycott products from countries that there is negative coverage on.

This is a very interesting report on the financing arm of the automotive industry. What compelled me to post this report is the concern I've heard multiple times from different sources about the increase in sub-prime lending and increasing risk of default and/or delinquency in the automotive sector, which is their explanation of the low P/E ratios and declining share prices for such stocks as Ford (F), Toyota (T), and General Motors (GM) despite the (seemingly) good news & earnings reports coming out.

Some interesting bits to take away:

* Page 18: As the housing bubble was popping (07-09), the average loan credit scores were reaching their peek, since then, they've declined steadily during the recovery. Credit scores of loans are now approximately what they were in 2007.

* Overall, Financing seems to be more popular as a method of paying for a car (pg. 29). People are willing to pay higher amounts per month than they were previously.

* Buy Here Pay Here (BHPH), where the local dealer themselves makes the loan to the customer, is becoming much less popular.

* Page 31 & 33: Captive Auto Loans (made by the auto manufacturer themselves to the buyer, such as Ford and Toyota) have similar delinquency rates as banks. Financing companies have by far the highest delinquency rates, but the rate has come down significantly from 3Q-2014 to 3Q-2015

* Pages 32 & 34: Maps of the united states with the 30 & 60-day delinquency rates by state. The worst area: the entire Southeast region. The best areas: Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the mid-west.

1zdz1r_GM,GM,American Airlines vs. GM question.,"A quick question for all the brilliant stock-watchers out there:  what are the differences in the GM bankruptcy v that of AA from a stock perspective?  I'll give a little background (mind you my knowledge of this sort of thing is very rudimentary). 

Years ago, I bought GM when it was in the shitter and it had an impending bailout. I didn't buy a lot, but did so under the logic that it's an American company too big and important to fail. Upon bankruptcy, I lost all of the shares I had purchased, and did not gain any when GM was relisted under its new ticker symbol. 

I pretty much did the exact same thing with AAL last year. Only, when it was relisted under its new ticker symbol, I was granted shares totaling (in dollars) what I had prior to AA bankruptcy. It's now worth something like 560% what I paid for it. 

Why did I lose my money in one situation (GM), but have my balance transferred at a discount stock price in the other (AA)?  Any insight would be helpful so I can make more educated decisions in the future. Thanks.",2014-03-03,6,2

Also, it's worth mentioning SCAD, Savannah College of Arts and Design, is a huge, private four-year film/production school in the area. We could possibly see a partnership in the future.

The fact that MDNT is getting mentioned in a group with General Motors, and AT&T also looks fantastic given it's just a small-cap.",2013-12-25,5,8

1iz8v2_GM,GM,Auto: F vs GM,"I've been following F for the past few months and have had some good success with it. I am interested in the automotive sector in general because I feel that a lot of the stocks in the sector are undervalued and will continue to climb. What are you opinions on F vs GM and which one would you buy?

EDIT: 
I've been going far in F so far, the thing that's made me want to look closer at GM is that they have a bigger market share so far and are going to have stronger pickup truck sales and in this area F has a stale product that will be refreshed next year. Pickups tend to bring in big money because the profit margins are higher and with the current housing recover its only going to drive pickup sales higher. ",2013-07-24,8,11
