1kuy9f2_GOOGL,GOOGL,"To the user claiming ""Gemini has inflated numbers"" (GOOG/GOOGL)","Another user wrote a post about why they were bearish on google, and I'm here to explain why they didn't do any research at all and show you why the quality of posts here has gone downhill.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini\_has\_inflated\_numbers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini_has_inflated_numbers/)

>Counting every AI powered snippet in Search as a Gemini interaction is inflating the numbers and turning an apples to oranges comparison into something that sounds more impressive than it really is. This only proves my thesis that I am bearish on Google.

**TL,DR/Intro:** Gemini and AI overview numbers are separate, this user didn't do any research & based their opinion on anecdotal comments instead of looking at data. My own personal *opinion* is that Google is currently winning the AI race, and will win in the future, as they simply have access to more compute and models which offer more/equal performance for similar/lower cost of compute. In addition, as others have mentioned, Google has a far greater variety of platforms with which they can integrate Gemini into, further incentivizing usage of the Google product suite and google ecosystem.

**Going deeper (Showing evidence):**

Gemini app usage is \~350 million users a month: [https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/)

>Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot, had 350 million monthly active users around the globe as of March, according to internal data revealed in Google’s ongoing antitrust suit.

AI Overviews usage is \~1.5 billion users a month, under ""Search"" subheading: [https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search)

>In Search, we saw continued double digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we’re excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode.

Gemini vs ChatGPT benchmarks: [https://livebench.ai/#/](https://livebench.ai/#/)

* For this, compare Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google's most powerful reasoning model) to o3 High (OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model): 78 Overall vs 80 Overall
* And compare Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google's faster, more affordable model) to o4-mini medium (OpenAI's more affordable model). 72 vs 74.5 overall
* However, a more fair comparison would be between the models free users can get with Google and OpenAI. For Google, free users get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash, while free users for ChatGPT only get limited access to ChatGPT-4o (Overall 64.65 score).
* Sources: [https://chatgpt.com/#pricing](https://chatgpt.com/#pricing), and [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for how I drew the comparisons.

**Gemini vs ChatGPT Compute Costs**: Gemini compute costs for Google are far less than OpenAI's, demonstrating Google has more cost-efficient models, important for scalability and profitability down the line. Gemini is also trained on Google TPUs while OpenAI relies on Nvidia hardware, which as we all know is sold at a premium.

For example: Gemini 2.5 Pro compute costs per 1M tokens = $17.50, assuming large input and output prompts. OpenAI's comparable model, o3, costs $25.00 when batching prompts (sending prompts all at once) or $52.50 when not using Batch API. When you look at Flash pricing vs GPT 4.1 pricing, the disparity is even worse considering Flash outperforms GPT 4.1 on Livebench.

* [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing)
* [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3)
* Add Input/Output costs - regardless of context costs price difference is still in favor of Google

Further: Google used Trillium TPUs to train Gemini 2.0, and likely used it to train Gemini 2.5 as well.

* [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/trillium-tpu-is-ga)

>We used Trillium TPUs to train the new [Gemini 2.0](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024), Google’s most capable AI model yet, and now enterprises and startups alike can take advantage of the same powerful, efficient, and sustainable infrastructure.

Meanwhile, OpenAI needs more GPUs and has run into issues because of it:

* However, it is important to note that Google does also order prolific numbers of Nvidia GPUs, but do not rely on them as much as OpenAI does due to Google building their own in house TPUs.

Whereas Google’s market capitalization is below $2 trillion, Luria said in a note to investors Monday that the lump sum of Google’s businesses, when valued separately, would be $3.7 trillion.

Luria said Google should break up YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and its AI segments.
That’s because Alphabet stock is trading at a historically low multiple of 16 times its forward earnings (over the next 12 months) — "" well below market multiple,"" he said.

1khz2nj_GOOGL,GOOGL,Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL),"We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. 

I'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just ""Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars."" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... 

I'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! 

Edit: I'll start with mine. 

Search- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.

YouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.

Cloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. 

Google networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.

Other -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?

Balance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? 

So, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time. ",2025-05-08,11,36

After Alphabet's results, it is a good time to check what has been written in the last few quarters :



**Aristotle Global Equity in their Q1'25 report :** 

*Headquartered in Mountain View, California and founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Alphabet is one of the world’s most dominant and innovative technology companies. Best known as the parent company of Google, Alphabet generates most of its revenue from digital advertising, particularly search. Google currently holds an estimated 87% market share in U.S. search and nearly 90% globally, underpinning a highly profitable ad business that accounts for roughly 75% of Alphabet’s total revenue.*

*While Google was founded in 1998 and became public in 2004, Alphabet was created in 2015 to provide greater transparency and operational independence across its varied business lines. Beyond its core, the company has increasingly diversified into accelerating products, including Google Cloud and YouTube’s suite of subscription services (YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and YouTube Music). Today, Google Services (Search, YouTube, Chrome, Android and the Play Store) makes up \~87% of total revenue, while Google Cloud represents \~13%. Alphabet also invests in longer-term innovation through its Other Bets segment, which includes autonomous driving (Waymo), life sciences (Verily) and advanced AI research (DeepMind).*

*Some of the quality characteristics we have identified for Alphabet include:*

*- Unrivaled scale in global search and digital advertising, protected by powerful network effects and vast proprietary data;*

*- An integrated ecosystem—across Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome and Gmail—that supports user retention and ad targeting efficiency;*

*- Category leadership in digital media, with YouTube generating over $45 billion in revenue in 2024 and expanding rapidly through ad-supported and subscription models;*

*- Emerging strength in cloud computing, with Google Cloud now profitable and scaling meaningfully; and*

*- A culture of innovation, supported by its Other Bets incubator, which allows Alphabet to invest in moonshot ideas while maintaining financial discipline.*

*We believe shares of Alphabet are significantly undervalued at less than 12x our estimate of normalized earnings. The company continues to scale high-margin businesses like Google Cloud and YouTube’s subscription offerings while maintaining robust FREE cash flow generation from its dominant advertising segment.*

*Catalysts we have identified for Alphabet, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:*

*- Sustained leadership in search and digital advertising, reinforced by Google’s unmatched first-party data and adtech platform;*

*- Improving profitability, margin expansion and market share gains for Google Cloud as it effectively competes at scale with AWS and Microsoft Azure; and*

*- Continued growth in YouTube subscription revenues as YouTube TV—which is on track to become the largest U.S. pay-TV provider by 2026—captures share from traditional cable providers and premium, ad-free content attracts a broader audience.*

*Potential Future Catalyst: Alphabet’s deep expertise and resources in AI, particularly through the Gemini model family (the company’s flagship large language model), could enhance monetization across Ads, Search and Cloud. Though this is not explicitly included in our valuation estimates, we view the possibility as a “free option.”*

  
**Covesto Patient Capital in their Q4'24 report :**

*Google's parent company is the world's largest search and advertising company, with revenue of $350.0bn in 2024 and an operating margin of 32% ($112.4bn EBIT). GOOG’s two most promising non-advertising businesses, Cloud and Waymo, are making rapid progress. Cloud reached 12% of FY24 revenue, growing 31% and delivering a 14% operating margin, with significant headroom. Waymo provides nearly 1m paid trips per month, has surpassed 50m miles of self-driving on public roads with 80% less accidents than a human driver and will soon test its robotaxis in ten new cities, including Tokyo. However, GOOG’s future hinges on the fate of its central cash cow: Search. Despite founder Sergey Brin’s return to lead GOOG’s AI initiatives, AI Overviews remain an insufficient answer to the self-triggered, LLM-driven Search revolution. Luckily, the recently unveiled AI Mode in Labs could be a promising step forward. In its ongoing antitrust saga, GOOG can expect a remedy ruling in H2/25. It will then appeal, and the case goes up to the D.C. Circuit. I have written extensively on GOOG’s business model here and its legal affairs here. GOOG trades at 15x NTM P/E.*



**Arar Fund in their Q4'24 report :**

*Alphabet was our sole mega-cap holding. I say ‘was’ because we have sold out of the position two days ago. The stock has been kind to us, appreciating over 50% since we bought. We still envision Alphabet is significantly undervalued and there is a good chance we will regret selling, especially so far from the recent top. Alas, we have our reasons. We are in a position that every stock in our portfolio makes sense, but whenever we identify a new undervalued stock, we need to make choices.*

*Until now, we maintained our position due to Alphabet’s attractive valuation relative to other Mag-7 stocks and Alphabet’s strong positioning in the development of AI.*

*Looking at autonomous drive, for instance, we see Waymo (part of Alphabet) clearly leading, rolling out to 6 new cities in 2025 while starting tests in 10 more. This indicates to me they are really getting close to reaching Full Autonomous Drive across the west. This by itself could be worth >200 bn Market Cap, especially since Ford has given up on their Cruise effort and Tesla seems to be going nowhere beyond driver assist. But even if we keep Chinese autonomous drive efforts out of the picture and price Waymo using only the rosiest scenario: 200 bn USD is only 1/10th of Alphabet’s current market cap.*

*By contrast, Alphabets value largely depends on Google Search. While its capabilities have taken another leap with the integration of Gemini, the sobering reality is that other LLM’s are now viable alternatives. Gemini currently rules the leaderboard at lmarena by some distance, but quality among all LLM’s has gone up so much that in most cases it doesn’t really matter which you use. And that is terrible for Alphabet, because that basically means people will choose based on convenience and price. That means Alphabet’s 92% market share in search can easily be split in four, and the AI-market will remain a near-zero margin business. This matters a lot when 35% of our valuation of Alphabet depends on Google Search!*

*Then lastly, there is quite a bit of new uncertainty with Trump. Software services are the biggest export product of the United States. This makes Alphabet (and others) an interesting option for retaliatory tariffs from the EU. Moreover, with the new attitude from the US regarding allies and partnership, it is not unrealistic to think the EU at some point will start to think more strategically regarding dependence on non-EU software.*

*In short: while Alphabet remains an amazing company at a reasonable multiple, threats to its business have arisen. For us this put it on the chopping block when new opportunities arose. We wish the company all the best and maybe, when it is back at 100.00 a share, we will be buyers once more!*

  
**Loomis Sayles Global Growth Fund in their Q3'24 report :**

*We believe Google's dominance in the online search and advertising market is a function of its superior product offerings and strong and sustainable competitive advantages – not the product of anti-competitive business practices. In Europe, where Google was required to provide users with a choice of browsers on its Android devices, the company maintains over 90% market share – suggesting the company’s dominance is a function of consumer preference and not its default positioning. Even on desktop devices pre-installed with Microsoft’s edge browser, the company captures over 80% of search activity. Further, if Google is enjoined from paying companies to secure default positioning, it may realize savings from the more than $20 billion it currently spends annually on customer acquisition costs.*

*As we did with earlier legal and regulatory challenges against the company, we will continue to monitor and assess any potential structural impact on our investment thesis for Alphabet and on the company’s market share or growth. However, we believe Alphabet remains well positioned to benefit from the secular shift of the approximately $1.85 trillion in global annual advertising and marketing expenditures outside of China to online and mobile advertising from traditional advertising media. We believe market expectations underestimate Alphabet’s long-term sustainable growth rate. Therefore, we believe the company is selling at a significant discount to our estimate of intrinsic value and offers a compelling reward-to-risk opportunity.*

  
**Merion Road Capital in their Q3'24 report :**

*Alphabet: We have held GOOG for a long time (since 2018) on the basis of its immense business quality paired with an undemanding valuation, improving treatment of minority shareholders, and multiple options for value creation. Recently we have seen Alphabet bashed for losing the AI race to now heralded for its progress. I remain excited about their prospects with several near-term, mid-term, and long-term tailwinds. Near-term, Google Cloud continues its rapid growth and their latest large language model, Gemini 2.0, appears to have made significant progress to better serve consumer needs and improve GOOG’s other product offerings. Mid-term, Waymo is on the cusp of becoming a real value driver for the company; there are abundant articles discussing Waymo stealing share from the ride-share economy and launching in new geographies. Long-term, GOOG’s recently announced quantum computing chip positions it well for a future (many, many years away) where computing process are fundamentally different than today. All of these options are embedded in a company that already has an established and dominant earnings stream.*

I'm leaning strongly on GOOGL as it currently entered a P/E ratio of 18.80, enormously low for the tech sector and a company that big.

ASML current P/E ratio is slightly higher: 25.62, but is also a good reduction from its historical ratio in 2024, along with a much higher EPS than GOOGL (as of their Q1 2025 report).

Financials of both companies seem to be solid. What are your guys thoughts and analysis?

1jz1h9a_GOOGL,GOOGL,GOOGL Call Strategy Ahead of I/O 2025: Triple Catalysts (TPU Ironwood/Waymo IPO/Auto-Scaling) + May,"Bullish strategy:

Short term: Buy 250417 165 call options, 1/4 position, entry price around 1.55.

Medium term: Buy 250530 165 call options, 1/4 position, entry price around 8.1.

Core logic

Fundamental support

Tariff exemption: US semiconductor equipment tariff exemption directly reduces the manufacturing cost of AI chips (TPU) and increases gross profit margin

Technical barriers: The seventh-generation TPU Ironwood has a 3,600-fold increase in inference performance, and cloud business competitiveness has been enhanced

Valuation repair: The current price-to-earnings ratio is 20.3 times, lower than the historical average of 21.5 times, and the target price implies a 27% upside

Technical breakthrough

The stock price broke through the short-term resistance level of $159.46, and the trading volume was mildly enlarged (turnover rate 0.05%), and the support level of $152.26 provided a safety margin

Google I/O Developer Conference

As an annual technology event, Google I/O is usually held in mid-to-late May, focusing on the release of innovative products such as artificial intelligence, Android system, and hardware (such as the Pixel series). The 2025 conference may continue this time frame

AI hardware iteration

The seventh-generation TPU Ironwood has been released. The next stage may focus on edge computing chips or quantum computing collaborative solutions to further consolidate cloud computing barriers

1jumlox_GOOGL,GOOGL,On GOOG Part 2 or GOOGL,"Thank you all for your comments.

After adjusting for potential share dilution (\~5.2% of float), 3 out of 4 major valuation-to-growth metrics (P/E, P/S, P/B) are still under 1—both on a 1-year and 5-year CAGR basis. That’s not nothing, especially for a mega-cap.

Balance sheet’s a fortress. Revenue and earnings are growing faster than the stock price. P/E is sitting at a 10-year low, which is wild given all the AI buzz.

Only real caution flag for me is Free Cash Flow. It’s growing, but the price you’re paying for that growth (P/FCF-to-growth) is *well* above 1, especially on a short-term basis. Even when you add back CapEx, the efficiency story still feels a little stretched. AI inference costs may explain that.

Regulatory risk? Still looming, but delayed. Even big EU fines take years to resolve—and Alphabet’s been through that dance before. Doesn’t look existential.

AI could actually be a tailwind for ad revenue: new ad surfaces (Circle, Lens, Gemini), same-level monetization in AI Overviews, and strong early ROI from AI-optimized campaigns.

1j90q1b_GOOGL,GOOGL,"GOOGL is the ultimate ""sleep well at night"" growth play","Alphabet has consistently beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter - a pretty clear sign that management knows what they're doing. I mean, a PE of 21 for a company this massive and profitable? That's practically stealing in today's market.

GOOGL's EV sits at $2,284B with earnings power value at $1,020.5B and market-implied growth value at $1,263.6B. Been on a steady climb since March 2020, absolutely taking off in 2023-2024.

When you dig into the Reverse DCF, you see an 11.8% implied FCF growth rate for the next decade (data source: [https://valuesense.io/ticker/goog/intrinsic-value](https://valuesense.io/ticker/goog/intrinsic-value)). With $72.8B in LTM free cash flow, a 2.5% long-term growth rate, and 9.2% discount rate, the math checks out perfectly to the current share price.

Waymo is an absolute beast right now - million paid rides monthly and growing. The revenue potential here is massive.

Let's not forget Google Cloud steadily expanding and their R&D budget (over $50B).

Yeah, antitrust is the elephant in the room, but hear me out - even a breakup could be bullish. Look at AT&T's breakup history - those Baby Bells made early investors absolute fortunes.

Trading at 52-week average, hitting $400 by 2027 seems totally reasonable based on their trajectory. The new administration might actually create a better regulatory environment, and even in a worst-case scenario, the sum of parts could easily be worth more than the current whole.

1j1mqvm_GOOGL,GOOGL,NVDA vs GOOGL,"Here's my qualitative analysis

Alphabet (GOOGL) appears to be the better value investment than NVIDIA (NVDA) at current prices.

Both are extraordinary businesses with solid moats, great financials, and bright futures. However, for long-term value-oriented investors, Alphabet offers a more compelling mix of value and quality. It is trading at an appreciable discount to its estimated intrinsic value with a comfortable margin of safety, and its valuation multiples are modest relative to its earnings power and growth prospects. Alphabet’s wide economic moat in search and advertising is deeply entrenched, and it continues to generate enormous free cash flows, which management is wisely using for reinvestment in AI and returning cash to shareholders. Investors in GOOGL are essentially getting a world-class compounder at a “fair” price or better – the kind of setup Buffett often likes (great business, fair price).

NVIDIA, on the other hand, while undeniably a great business, is priced for perfection. Its recent fundamentals are stellar (sky-high ROE/ROIC and growth), but the stock’s current price leaves little room for error and embeds expectations of prolonged hyper-growth. The lack of a margin of safety means a value investor would have to rely on NVDA’s future growth to justify today’s valuation – a more speculative proposition in value terms. Put simply, NVDA is an outstanding company selling at a premium, whereas GOOGL is an outstanding company selling at a reasonable (if not discounted) price. Mohnish Pabrai’s mantra is “Heads, I win; tails, I don’t lose much.” Alphabet fits that spirit better: if things go as usual, you win (the company continues to grow and the market re-rates it upwards), and if things go poorly, you have a cushion in the valuation. NVIDIA, by contrast, could deliver huge wins if it continues dominating AI (heads, you win big), but if something goes wrong (tails), the downside could be significant because of the lofty starting point.

Therefore, based on the analysis of intrinsic value, moat, financial strength, profitability, and valuation, Alphabet (GOOGL) is recommended as the superior long-term value investment over NVIDIA (NVDA) at current levels. Alphabet aligns more closely with Buffett and Pabrai’s principles – it’s a high-quality franchise available at an attractive price with a margin of safety – while NVIDIA, despite its quality, is a more aggressive play with a valuation that a conservative value investor might shy away from right now.

Investment Verdict: Buy/Accumulate Alphabet (GOOGL) for value-focused portfolios. NVIDIA (NVDA) is a hold or watchlist candidate – a phenomenal company, but wait for a better entry price or a wider margin of safety before committing new capital.

# Analysis & Thoughts 💡

1. **NVIDIA dominates** in growth metrics (**EPS, revenue, and FCF growth**), making it an attractive high-growth stock.
2. **GOOGL wins** in **financial stability** (lower debt, better interest coverage, and cash ratio).
3. **NVDA's high ROE and ROIC** indicate superior capital efficiency, which is key for value investors.
4. **GOOGL's valuation (Earnings Yield, P/E) is more attractive**, meaning it's potentially undervalued.
5. **NVDA's present discount (30%)** is slightly better than GOOGL's (25%), but both are trading at high valuations.

Would you be buying at these levels or waiting for a better entry point?

Bought AMZN and GOOGL ITM leaps last week during the drop. Doubled down on few more googl as it dropped last Friday. 



I believe in GOOGL fair value and it should be able to recover back to 190-200 range soon. Will take profit when it returns to 190-195 and hold a bit longer for the leaps.

1ionq6b_GOOGL,GOOGL,Nancy Pelosi NEW $GOOGL Position 🗞️,"
Nancy Pelosi’s financial disclosure report shows she purchased 50 call options on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) with a $150 strike price, expiring in January 2026. The transaction, valued between $250,001 and $500,000, suggests a bullish stance on Google’s stock price.

Possible Short-Term Impact on GOOGL:
	1.	Increased Market Attention: Large trades by high-profile figures, especially politicians, often attract retail and institutional investors. This could lead to short-term buying pressure on GOOGL.
	2.	Speculation on Future Catalysts: Pelosi’s stock trades have historically sparked speculation about potential government policies or insider knowledge. Investors might anticipate upcoming favorable developments for Google (e.g., regulatory decisions, AI advancements).
	3.	Momentum Effect: If traders interpret this move as a signal of confidence in Google’s future performance, the stock price could experience short-term upward momentum.",2025-02-13,4371,484

1iis4qs_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

In terms of 'RSI', MACD line, etc. I did explore it to kinda predict NVDA stock, but it was all a bust. I don't know if it is worth pursing it big time.

# Alphabet Slides After Cloud Sales Fall Short of Expectations

Alphabet just reminded investors that even tech giants can trip. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue landed at $96.5 billion—just shy of expectations—but the real disappointment came from Google Cloud. The division pulled in $12 billion, missing forecasts and raising concerns about whether AI-driven cloud growth is slowing down. Investors didn’t take it well. Shares tumbled over 9% in after-hours trading, wiping out much of this year’s gains.

**Big AI Bets, Bigger Bills**  
  
While cloud struggled, Alphabet is doubling down on AI. The company announced a jaw-dropping $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, blowing past Wall Street’s $58 billion estimate. That cash will fund data centers and infrastructure to power AI ambitions, giving a nice boost to chip supplier Broadcom, whose shares popped 6%. But with rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek proving they can build AI models for far less, Alphabet’s spending spree is raising eyebrows.

**Search Still Reigns, But Challenges Mount**  
  
Despite the cloud miss, Google’s core business held strong. Search advertising raked in $54 billion, edging past estimates, while YouTube brought in $10.5 billion—helped by a surge in election-year podcast ads. Meanwhile, Waymo and other experimental projects in Alphabet’s “Other Bets” segment fell flat, reporting just $400 million in revenue, well below expectations. Investors are increasingly questioning whether these moonshot ventures are worth the money.

Beyond earnings, Alphabet is facing growing regulatory headaches. U.S. and Chinese regulators are circling, with lawsuits targeting its search dominance and ad practices. At the same time, AI challengers are nipping at Google’s heels, with OpenAI now embedding real-time search capabilities into ChatGPT. For now, Alphabet is stuck balancing massive AI investments, legal fights, and investor jitters. Whether all that spending translates into long-term dominance—or just thinner margins—remains the trillion-dollar question.

# Market Movements

* 📉 **Tariff Uncertainty Puts the Fed in a Bind**: The Federal Reserve faces a dilemma as Trump's tariffs threaten to both raise inflation and slow GDP growth. Economists project tariffs could shave 1.2% off growth while adding 0.7% to core inflation, potentially forcing the Fed to delay rate cuts or pivot later in the year ($SPX).
* 📉 **U.S. Job Openings Drop Sharply in December**: Job openings fell to 7.6 million, the lowest level since September and below expectations of 8 million. The decline was driven by drops in professional services, education, and finance, though hiring and quit rates held steady. The Fed is watching the labor market closely for signs of cooling ($SPX).
* 🚘 **GM Slashes 50% of Cruise Staff After Robotaxi Exit**: General Motors is laying off half of Cruise’s workforce following its decision to shut down the robotaxi business. The move comes after GM spent over $10 billion on Cruise, which faced regulatory scrutiny and leadership failures before halting operations ($GM).
* 📱 **Apple Launches 'Invites' App to Take on Partiful**: Apple introduced a new event-planning app called 'Apple Invites,' allowing users to create and manage RSVPs. The app requires an iCloud+ subscription, integrating AI features for automated invitations. The move expands Apple’s services strategy amid growing subscription revenue ($AAPL).
* 🚗 **Tesla’s Market Share Plummets in Scandinavia**: Tesla lost ground in Sweden and Norway, with January registrations dropping 44% and 38% year-over-year despite overall auto sales rising. Public sentiment toward the brand soured following Elon Musk’s political remarks, cutting Tesla’s market share in Sweden to 2.1% and in Norway to 7.4% ($TSLA).
* 📉 **Vanguard Slashes Fees, Pressuring Rivals**: Vanguard is cutting fees on 87 U.S. funds by an average of 20%, saving investors $350 million this year. The move, its largest-ever fee reduction, ramps up pressure on competitors like BlackRock and Fidelity ($BLK).
* 🕶️ **Meta Nears $100 Billion in VR Investments**: Meta is set to surpass $100 billion in total spending on VR and smart glasses, allocating another $20 billion to Reality Labs this year. Despite generating $2.1 billion in 2024 revenue, the unit posted a staggering $17.7 billion operating loss. Meta is now shifting its focus toward AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses over its metaverse ambitions ($META).
* 💊 **Novo Nordisk Faces Investor Scrutiny Over Obesity Drug**: Novo Nordisk investors are pressing for more details on CagriSema after disappointing trial results in December erased $125 billion from the company’s market cap.

* 🏈 **Super Bowl 59 to Stream for Free on Tubi**: Fox is making history by streaming this year’s Super Bowl on its ad-supported platform, Tubi. The move is aimed at expanding Tubi’s audience, which recently reached 97 million monthly users ($FOXA).

* 🔧 **Microsoft Drops VPN Feature from 365**: Microsoft is removing the built-in VPN feature from Microsoft 365 on February 28, citing low usage. The decision follows a recent subscription price hike of $3 per month to include AI features ($MSFT).

# Echelon Of Earnings From AMD, Chipotle, Snapchat

**AMD’s Data Center Miss Overshadows Strong Earnings**  
  
AMD delivered a solid earnings beat, but investors were fixated on a shortfall in its data center business. The chipmaker posted $7.66 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations, yet its crucial data center unit fell short, reporting $3.86 billion instead of the projected $4.14 billion. Despite a 69% year-over-year jump in data center sales—driven by AI chip demand—Wall Street wanted more. Shares dropped 5% in extended trading. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, forecasting strong double-digit growth in 2025 as AMD scales its AI chip business, but for now, the market isn’t buying in.

**Chipotle’s Forecast Sours Otherwise Strong Earnings**  
  
Chipotle kept the burritos rolling with solid Q4 earnings, but its outlook left investors with indigestion. The company posted $2.85 billion in revenue, matching estimates, while earnings per share came in slightly ahead. Traffic remained strong, up 4% year over year, and the brand continued outpacing the broader restaurant industry. However, a lukewarm 2025 same-store sales forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth disappointed Wall Street, leading to a 3% drop in after-hours trading. Chipotle remains bullish on expansion, planning to open up to 345 new locations—most featuring drive-thru “Chipotlanes”—but investors were hoping for a bigger growth story.

**Snap Pops on Earnings Beat, But Guidance Disappoints**  
  
Snap’s stock jumped after the social media company reported a rare earnings win, with revenue climbing 14% to $1.56 billion and daily active users hitting 453 million—both ahead of expectations. The company even turned a profit, a major turnaround from last year’s loss. However, the celebration was short-lived as Snap’s Q1 guidance underwhelmed, with projected earnings below analyst expectations. The company cited increased investment spending, legal costs, and a seasonal marketing shift as key factors. While its Snapchat+ subscription service continues to gain traction, adding 2 million subscribers in Q4, Snap still faces regulatory scrutiny and heavy competition from Meta and TikTok.  


# Trump Signs Order to Create U.S. Sovereign-Wealth Fund

President Trump is making big moves again—this time by signing an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The goal? Monetize America’s balance sheet, invest in national projects, and, according to Trump, maybe even play a role in securing a deal for TikTok.

At an Oval Office ceremony, Trump framed the fund as a game-changer for U.S. economic strategy, promising it would be “one of the biggest.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed up the urgency, pledging to “stand this thing up within the next 12 months.”

**How Would It Work?**

Sovereign wealth funds aren’t new—Norway, China, and Saudi Arabia have been running them for years, leveraging oil profits and trade surpluses to bankroll investments. The U.S., however, has a slight problem: no surplus.

The government’s balance sheet is heavy on real estate and student loans but light on liquid assets, making funding a massive investment vehicle tricky. Trump floated the idea of using tariff revenue to fund the venture—though that assumes the recently delayed tariffs actually go into effect and generate enough cash.

**A New Player in Global Markets?**

If it gets off the ground, the fund would join a crowded field of government-backed investors influencing everything from infrastructure to AI. Trump’s team has hinted that it could be used to invest in manufacturing, defense, and critical supply chains, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggesting the U.S. should get equity stakes in companies it does business with—think vaccine makers and defense contractors.

**TikTok’s Wild Card Role**

Trump also hinted that the fund could somehow facilitate TikTok’s U.S. future, though the details remain murky. The president has been pushing for an American-owned TikTok spin-off and previously suggested the government itself should take a 50% stake. Whether the fund plays a role in that deal—or if it’s just Trump thinking out loud—remains to be seen.

The executive order gives officials 90 days to draft a plan detailing investment strategies, governance, and legal considerations. But without a clear funding source, it’s unclear how this fund would compete with the trillion-dollar giants already dominating the space.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow brings another check-up on the labor market with the ADP private payroll report, offering insights into hiring trends nationwide. December saw 122,000 new jobs added—solid, but a step down from November’s 146,000. Economists are cautiously optimistic about January’s numbers, with seasonal hiring expected to lend a boost.

On the earnings front, a packed slate awaits. Uber ($UBER), Arm Holdings ($ARM), MicroStrategy ($MSTR), Qualcomm ($QCOM), GSK ($GSK), Ford ($F), Toyota ($TM), Boston Scientific ($BSX), Allstate ($ALL), The New York Times ($NYT), and Harley Davidson ($HOG) are all set to unveil their latest results.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Disney’s** streaming journey has been a rocky road, but the recent merger of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV is a major win. The deal adds over 1.6 million subscribers in one swoop and clears some legal headaches. Now, the focus shifts to keeping customers hooked, turning a profit, and dealing with slowing revenue at its Asian theme parks. Consensus: $1.43 EPS, $24.7 billion in revenue. ($DIS)
* **Novo Nordisk** recently stumbled with the failure of its new weight-loss drug, CagriSema, a rare setback for the pharma giant. Shares have taken a hit over the past year, but strong sales from current blockbusters like Wegovy and Ozempic could offer a silver lining. For patient investors, this dip might present a chance to buy in at a more attractive valuation. Consensus: $0.85 EPS, $11.34 billion in revenue. ($NVO) ",2025-02-04,3,0

1dbvyv3_MSFT,MSFT,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",2024-06-09,284,244

Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful.

Alphabet's valuation is attractive relative to other big tech stocks - especially looking at Free Cash Flow - and it's got one of the stronger balance sheets of the bunch too.

You can see a comparison of some valuation metrics in the table below:

|**Where does GOOG rank?**|1st|2nd behind META|1st|

Let me just make clear:

* I personally like the company and gradually built up a position during 2022/2023 - the valuation was too attractive not to at the time imo. I last added at $127 (average cost is much lower) - after the Q3 earnings dip - but am reluctant to add more at the current valuation; I don't think it's an awful buy right now but I'd like a larger margin of safety. Hopefully, no one reads the title and assumes it's my opinion.

So although I like Alphabet overall, I am aware that there are risks that shouldn't be overlooked and a fair bit of unpredictability around the company's future, particularly regarding the competitive landscape of the industries it operates in.

It would be very valuable to read some of the more bearish perspectives on the company - so feel free to explain why you aren't a fan, or even just play devil's advocate.",2024-02-09,58,122

It would be very valuable to read some of the more bearish perspectives on the company - so feel free to explain why you aren't a fan, or even just play devil's advocate.",2024-02-09,56,122

* Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies’ search default agreement, an Alphabet witness said in open court Monday.
* The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google’s search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company.

Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies’ search default agreement, an Alphabet

witness said in open court Monday amid a protracted antitrust battle between Google and the Department of Justice.

The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google’s search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company. Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals’ details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.

The incidental disclosure from Alphabet’s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy’s testimony came as part of the company’s efforts to fight the Justice Department’s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.

Williams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.

The search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the “heart” of the case. It’s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.

Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google’s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft

CEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.

Nadella said that “every year” he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had “dialogues” with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft’s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.

Nadella said that the idea of an “open web” was a misnomer. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said on the stand.",2023-11-14,553,105

* SPOT is lower by about 6% on its report. Options priced about 8%

Happy mega-cap AI day to all those that celebrate as both Microsoft and Alphabet report after the close. Currently, options are pricing about a 5% for both stocks.

MSFT stock has given up all the gains from its mid-July gap higher. The 5% expected move lines up near those highs to the upside and to the monthly lows on the downside. An Iron Condor based on those levels would profit as long as MSFT was between 326.50 and 363.50 on Friday, lining up pretty close to those support and resistance levels. If the stock busts out of that range the risk is about 1.50 to 1 on this 2.5 wide example.

Investors await a flood of earnings headlined by **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and Google parent **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**). 

 

Buying opportunities haven't been plentiful, and many have fizzled or failed. Earnings season will hit full force in the coming week, offering the potential for the market rally to break out of its rut.

Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google are especially important. Microsoft and, arguably, Amazon stock are actionable now. Google stock is close to a buy point while Facebook parent Meta is pulling back after a massive run.

By themselves, they have a big impact on the major indexes. And their comments about future growth in key markets such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and PCs will have a major influence on the tech sector and beyond.

 

Meanwhile, **First Solar** ($**FSLR**), **Dexcom** ($**DXCM**), **Mobileye** ($**MBLY**), **Boeing** ($**BA**), **ServiceNow** ($**NOW**), **Cloudflare** ($**NET**), **Align Technology** ($**ALGN**), **Fair Issac** ($**FICO**), **Visa** ($**V**) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ($**CMG**) are just some of the notable companies reporting this coming week with stocks in or near buy zones.

MBLY stock in particular has an action-packed week, with its IPO lockup expiration on Monday followed by earnings on Wednesday.

**Bed Bath & Beyond** ($**BBBY**) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday, with the long-ailing housewares retailer struggling with debts and declining sales. BBBY stock has been plunging for a long time, but the meme stock did jump 23% last week despite the prospect of bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, keep an eye out for news on **Shockwave Medical** ($**SWAV**). SWAV stock spiked Friday on a report that **Boston Scientific** ($**BSX**) is mulling a **Shockwave takeover bid**. But the companies haven't said anything.

The video embedded in this article reviewed **Arista Networks** ($**ANET**), **TJX Cos.** ($**TJX**) and **JPMorgan Chase** ($**JPM**).

Dow Jones futures fell 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures declined 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.2%.

Remember that overnight action in **Dow futures** and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular **stock market** session.

The stock market rally didn't have a lot of direction this past week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2% in last week's **stock market trading**. The S&P 500 index edged down 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.6%.

The Financial Select SPDR ETF ($**XLF**) climbed 1%, with JPM stock a major holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF ($**KRE**) advanced 1.5%, but has a long way to go to recover.

Many companies tout AI technology initiatives and machine learning. But there really are few public, pure-play AI stocks.

In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence technology to improve products or gain a strategic edge. Amid a surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence, be on guard against poor performing companies that tout themselves as plays on AI stocks.

Microsoft (MSFT)  has increased its stake in startup OpenAI as it aims to take on Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) in internet search. 

Also, Microsoft and Google in early February hosted media events highlighting artificial intelligence initiatives and investments. Analysts said Microsoft came out ahead in terms of describing its product strategy and  showcasing ChatGPT technology from OpenAI.

ChatGPT is only one of many ""generative AI"" technologies that could roil a host of industries by creating text, images, video and computer programming code on their own. Generative AI technology already is finding applications in marketing, advertising, drug development, legal contracts, video gaming, customer support and digital art.


Key to the rise of generative AI are improved natural language processing models that help computers understand the way that humans write and speak. OpenAI is part of a wave of NLP startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere and others. All AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. And the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.

In addition, Bank of America is bullish on AI and internet companies.

""Use of AI will be critical driver of all things Internet, including content relevance, ad performance, e-commerce conversion, marketplace efficiency and even customer service,"" BofA analyst Justin Post said in a recent note to clients.

zvmhly_GOOGL,GOOGL,Why GOOGL is no longer as innovative as before and what the future holds for it?,"It should be obvious by now that GOOGL has a product problem. They have released quite  a lot of products only to fail to follow up on them and die out or have some other company come in and take the lead.

They are supposed to have some really smart people but they can't seem to turn these products into successful ones. 

You can take a look at how many products and services they have released over the years only to miserably fail one after another ( www.killedbygoogle.com )

That said, Google has a pretty good record in the past (Gmail, search, maps, android etc) but they have stalled big time and haven't had any products that can make them a ton of money hence why I consider the company as a one trick pony one. I can't remember when was the last time they released something and gained momentum. Granted, you could just as easily say the same for APPL but they still put out products reminding people they are still very much relevant. When was the last time you got excited over a google product release? Did pixel hit the front page of anything? Doubt it. 

A case could be made for cloud but still every time people talk about the cloud, the discussion is usually between AWS and Azure with Google cloud coming in 3rd and potentially have market share taken from it over the next years. 

They have got a long list of failed projects by jumping into every kind of business only to fail to monetize something. Their best products are the ones are the ones they've had for a long time such as Gmail, maps etc. 
I think it all comes down to the management and as far as I'm concerned, I do think that GOOGL ceo is probably the worst ceo out of the big tech.

Google has:

*Still putting up insane growth numbers YoY

*At a roughly 9 month low and very strong support

*Obviously a very strong future with tons of investment in research and development (particularly cloud computing and working on autonomous cars)

*Stock split coming up that could have a bit of upside


Especially with continued earnings growth it just looks like such a good spot. I know it had an insane (65%!) 2021, but the P/E ratio actually went down since then, which would mean the market was just pricing in (and technically underpricing because P/E dropped) the earnings growth throughout 2021.

I recently was introduced to how to properly make use of a credit spread around earnings. It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?

2) Plays
Based on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week. I appreciate all constructive feedback. Or even non constructive. 
$AAPL DOWN 4%
$TSLA DOWN 5%
$SBUX UP 3%
$AMD DOWN 1% then UP next day 4%
$GOOGL ? %2

I have some light DD on these I am willing to debate with people, brings on your thoughts or any other juicy looking low hanging fruit for next week. I don't have a large account for next week's plays so I will probably pick the 2 I think most likely to print from different sectors and maybe a small call or put on an index containing one of them. Or maybe a collaborative play on QQQ going down as a lot of the names I am interested in are tech companies.

Edit.. after some more DD I'm gonna throw $F in the ring for at Down 4%. This is based mostly on looking at big news items that effect collaborative stocks (Tsla, gm, nio, etc.). While the others seem to have a reaction to news, $F seems to be immune from good news giving it a boost.

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Completes-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Company-Hotify-Inc?id=225956](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Completes-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Company-Hotify-Inc?id=225956)

June 2020: Sonasoft quietly submitted 2 huge SEC 8-K filings. 1) deal with $FIS for the development of AI solutions, and 2) deal with Google to develop Google Cloud Learning Systems

**FIS -** [**https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14151883&guid=RktKUqJE71\_MX3h**](https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14151883&guid=RktKUqJE71_MX3h)

(Both Google and FIS would have APPROVED these filings)

**July 2020: Sonasoft (SSFT)** Reports full-year **2019 Audited Revenue of $13.33 Million;** an Increase of **1260% YoY**; First Quarter 2020 Revenue of $2.8 Million; an Increase of 47% YoY 

[**https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Reports-full-year-2019-Audited-Revenue-of-1333-Million-an-Increase-of-1260-YoY-First-Quarter-2020-Revenue-?id=268275**](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Reports-full-year-2019-Audited-Revenue-of-1333-Million-an-Increase-of-1260-YoY-First-Quarter-2020-Revenue-?id=268275)

**Points of interest:** After the Google and FIS filings, SSFT did NOT put out formal PR’s pumping the deals etc. Most OTC stocks would have never shut up about huge named deals like that. Why did they stay so quiet?

Well, it would seem they are more concerned with building the business/company than pumping their stock. Breath of fresh air. They would have most likely had to file NDA’s with those giant companies and also they would want to keep their dealings under the radar as to not tipoff the competition (my views)

After the 8-K filings and subsequent Audited $13.33M in revenue announcements, the Company went silent and the stock flew under the radar for months despite the huge deals in the works. 

**Finally, on Dec 30, 2020: SSFT** provided annual update which described its AI tech, its strengthened AI Engineering and Management teams**, a deal with a “multi-billion-dollar financial services company”,** and I think possibly most importantly – **Announced they had filed a patent to protect their Intellectual Property relating to their AI tech.**

The patent filings as well as the deal with the multi-billion-dollar financial services firm (I am assuming that is $FIS) explains why the Company was so quiet over the past 6+ months. They were working on a huge deal with cutting-edge technology – both of which needed to be kept quiet to protect the deal (my opinion obviously)

Following the December 30 announcements, the market began to slowly catch on and trading volumes and price started to really pick up. Sentiment and interest on message board has significantly increased as well.

Then, most recently on January 28th 2021 – SSFT announced yet another key patent filed for its AI tech. Once again strengthening their position and protecting/increasing shareholder value even more.

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Files-Key-Patent-That-Will-Improve-AI?id=287849](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Files-Key-Patent-That-Will-Improve-AI?id=287849)

Share Structure:

SSFT has done a fantastic job raising capital to drive growth while simultaneously protecting shareholder value. They have NO toxic debt. The majority of shares are held by insiders and long-term shareholders. One investor alone Dr. R Japra owns 33% of the outstanding share count\*\* (baller).

**Moving Forward:**

So, what is next for SSFT? Well, investors are speculating we could be waiting on details relating to the Google or FIS deals, further patents, or new deals with other big named companies (they already have a long list of big named clients).

Further, the fact that FIS and Google chose SSFT as their AI tech provider speaks volumes about the efficacy of the tech. And now this tech is in the process of becoming IP protected / Patented which could add significant value to the company.

In previous Press Releases, the company has mentioned intentions to up-list to higher exchanges (Nasdaq) and also that the steps it is taking would make SSFT an attractive buyout candidate by a larger company.

The RedHat buyout by IBM comes to mind from a couple years ago. Investors woke up one morning to learn that RedHat was getting acquired for $34 Billion 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-its-34-billion-acquisition-of-red-hat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-its-34-billion-acquisition-of-red-hat.html)

With the current climate in the OTC Markets and stock market in general with companies like AITX and TSNP running up to hundreds of million $ and even BILLION $ market caps (while having BILLIONS of shares outstanding) – I think $SSFT with their relatively tight share structure, $13M+ audited revs, and huge current deals with major companies has a great shot at running into the dollars from its current price of 0.18/share.

Of course, DO NOT take my word for anything. I’m just pointing out what I like / think and my opinions. I am just letting people know they might want to investigate this one and do some DD/Research.

I welcome any thoughts / feedback.

Thanks for reading. I truly hope you all make tons of $$$

The VIX is near 40, and that means expected moves for all stocks have expanded. 7 day expected moves for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook are now about 25% more than they were at this time last week, now having to incorporate the election and broader market vol. However... because it's Thursday we get a pretty good sense of the event moves themselves using tomorrow's expiration. Here's how the expected moves for tomorrow's close look for the big 4 reporting tonight:

&#x200B;

Here's how that expected move translates into the condor in AAPL for tomorrow's expiry. It's weird seeing numbers so small for AAPL post split, is the 10 wide condor too tight? $5 moves don't seem very big but it is a different stock now at 114, the risk-reward is decent for something so binary and getting it as close to 1 to 1 is ideal (if possible).

ii8wsu_AAPL,AAPL,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",2020-08-28,1761,723

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",2018-04-17,32,122
7wv1rm_GOOGL,GOOGL,Fundamental Analysis; Alphabet Inc $GOOGL,"Hello /r/stockmarket!

Even in these tough times, I keep chopping away at the research and analysis that I always do. Today's write-up is about Alphabet Inc, more commonly known as the parent company of Google (Ticker: $GOOGL). As always, this is my own fundamental analysis, and the write-up that follows. I employ trend research and discounted cash flow analysis, and it is fully up to you if you want to take anything here written as fact. Numbers and information is taken from the 4th quarter of 2017 and earlier. That said, here is my view of Alphabet Inc.
__________
**The company**  
Alphabet is an holding and parent company of many subsidiaries, focusing on technology. What kind of technology you ask? Well, a ton of it. Here is a list of some of the subsidiaries that Alphabet has under its massive technological wing:

* Google, an internet company focusing on it’s famous search engine, advertising business and video service through Youtube. It goes without saying that Google is by far the largest and most profitable of Alphabets businesses.
* Calico, a R&D biotech company
* Chronicle, a cybersecurity and anti-hacking company
* Dandelion, a geothermal energy startup company.
* DeepMind, an Artificial intelligence company
* GV (Google venture), a strategic investment company
* CapitalG (Google Capital), a profit-directed investment company
* Google fiber, a developer for fiber networking and an ISP 
* Nest Labs, a home automation company. Develops programmable home appliances. 
* Jigsaw (Google Ideas), a tech incubator company, focusing on unique technology
* Sidewalk labs, urban innovation company, developer within infrastructure and urban technology.
*  Verily (Google X), life-science research and development company
* Waymo, world leading company in autonomous driving

As you can see, the list of technological focuses is incredibly broad. Alphabet is an ad company that puts all its profits into developing thousands of products to revolutionize the future.

**Fundamentals & Forecasts**   
Alphabet has a annual revenue of $110,8 billion, resulting in a gross profit of $66,5 billion and a net profit (earnings) of $13,9 billion. That is an 24% increase in revenue year to year (y/y). Alphabets numbers are slightly jumbled up recently as this quarter, like many other tech giants in the US following the tax reform of the new year, moved huge amount of international profits into the US. This resulted in alphabets tax rate for Q4 2017 to become 138% of their pre-tax income. We have to adjust for this one time payment, as Alphabet moves that money into the country to invest in their capital expenditure and R&D. The company has a historical tax rate of roughly 18-19%, which is very low. Also of note, Alphabet has during the last 2 years fairly consistently increased their R&D spending by 20% y/y each quarter, really highlighting how the company is putting more and more money into their technology R&D. Their general operating margin is roughly 60%, which is also very high, but not uncommon in the ad market. A last notion to mention is that Alphabet is after their intake of additional saved up international cash very net cash positive, with a war chest of $97 billion. As a huge part of Alphabet is founding its own startups, acquiring other startups that have potential and investing in either one, their huge war chest is a very strong advantage for them to have. 

Alphabet is huge. It’s enormous. This makes forecasting complicated as they can have huge swings if their profitability goes down, and it could be very hard to recover. I preface the next message with this, so you as a reader is aware. Alphabet right now has amazing fundamentals. The company is incredibly strong. They have the historical income numbers of a growth company, while being profitable and stable. These are facts that make Alphabet very fundamentally sound.

 If we assume that Alphabet reached their growth peak in 2017, and from there have a steady growth slowdown until they run into a complete growth-stop in 2030, as well as maintained tax rate (20%), gross (& operating) margin (60% respective 23%), we still see upside in its current price. These calculations were done at a -3% maturity rate, along with a discount rate of 7%. These are fairly standard industry numbers. Using this pessimistic view of the company in my eyes, seeing no further improvement, the net present stock value would end up at $1199, a valuation upside of 15% after the recent drop. The more realistic scenario is the same, except that we maintain the current growth for the coming year, and then seeing a slower maturity drop until the growth-stop, we see an 34% upside, $1402. 

  __________


**Concerns & Risk**  
The recent discussions about Alphabet is its issues with TAC, traffic acquisition cost. That is the cost that Alphabet pays to get traffic to their services, where the expense is increasing and margins decreasing fairly rapidly. At the beginning of 2016, the ad revenue of $18 million was hurt by a TAC of $3.7 million, which is an TAC cost of sale of 21% of the ad revenue. These numbers increased to $21.4 million, $4.63 million and 21.6% respectively. Now, at the end of 2017, the TAC expense grows 11.5% faster than the ad revenue. This is clearly a problem for Google as a service, and as their margins fall, this causes real concern about their profitability. If we apply a lowering margin down from a VERY consistent 60% gross margin after cost of sales, down 1% per year down to 53%, we see the net present evaluation drop to 946 per share, a -10% downside. This is a real risk, and is the scenario where Google slowly loses its iron grasp on the ad industry. The very realistic scenario, the middle ground, is where Alphabets margins drop from their consistent 60%, to 56% by 2020. 56% gross margin was what happened this last quarter, Q417, which caused the 10% drop in value along with uncertainties in the overall market. If Alphabet never recovers from this drop in margin, their current valuation is fair. If they recover but slowly struggle down to 56% again, even slowly down to 53%,  they have a very slight downside. As you can see, this is a potential problem for Google. It is worth pointing out that this drop is very abrupt, a blip, and is no proof of any sort of a trend. A similar company, Facebook $FB, has a gross margin of 87%, which shows that higher margins is also attainable.

**My view**  
Alphabet has been my personal favorite company since I became an adult, which makes me slightly biased. I am happy to report that my financial knowledge tells me that they also deserve the praise I give them personally. The company is amazing, attaining growth numbers that shouldn’t happen to large businesses like this. Most analysts are right to worry about the recent decline in gross margins, but if these are improved, they should be a catalyst that removes the sliver of doubt that is the only thing holding Alphabets price down. I will most certainly hold Alphabet through that. It is such a diverse business, deep into the future of tech, supported by the greatest ad company this world have ever seen. They are regulated hard to leave their main product, Google search engine, unbiased as if they were greedy with it, could dominate any market. That power is impossible to put a $ on.

I personally believe that Google is a perfect buying opportunity for a very long term investment. They will get their margins back on track, their excellent management fully understand this. It might not be the next quarter, it might not be the quarter after that. However, if we assume that their operating margins look very realistic, bordering pessimistic, and that they recover their margin issue over the next 4 years, their net present stock value is $1236, a 18% upside. This doesn’t make Alphabet a snap purchase, but it makes them a fair purchase. When you buy Alphabet you buy a sliver of the future. They have their hand in every single futuristic technology, everything from Biotech to AI and self-driving cars, to VR/AR to the internet of things. They are industry leaders in all of these (barring biotech, tough industry). When these markets become profitable in the future, your good purchase of Alphabet today becomes an excellent hedge into the R&D of the future.

I bought Alphabet right before the drop of 10%. My only mistake is that I did not buy more. However, it turned out fine since it tanked. I am happy people doubt their margins because WHEN they recover, I will own a lot more Alphabet than I would have without the drop.

If you would like the model, I’ll be happy to send it over.

Edit: Considering a large amount of people wanting to see the model, I post the final version here instead of sending them through PMs. Keep in mind before you take any information away from it, this is only a part of the fundamental analysis, so don't get caught up on it. As well, a lot of unsaved editing have been made during the course of the analysis, this is only the final iteration and the last viewpoint I have made.
