* The current market downturn appears to be an event-driven bear market (triggered by tariffs), though it could easily transform into a cyclical bear market given the growing recession risk, with economists having raised the recession probability from 15% to 45%.
* Bear market rallies are common during downturns, with data showing these typically last around 44 days with returns of 10-15%, but a sustained recovery requires a combination of cheap valuations, extreme negative positioning, policy intervention, and slowing macro deterioration.
* Current valuations remain expensive by historical standards, particularly in the US, suggesting further downside potential before markets can transition into the ""hope"" phase that marks a new bull market.

Trump’s talk of 15% tariffs on all trading partners could throw the global economy into chaos. We’re talking higher prices, disrupted supply chains, and strained international relationships. On top of that, inflation is expected to hit 3.5% by the end of 2025, which means everyday stuff is going to get even more expensive. And with GDP growth now expected to slow to just 1%, it really feels like the economy is losing steam. If things keep heading in this direction, a recession isn’t just possible—it’s likely.

1jamnua_PATH,PATH,"Scott Rubner, ex-Goldman Sachs had predicted the correction back on Feb 20th","**Pasting below from this article (behind a paywall, published on 20th Feb)**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/goldman-s-rubner-sees-correction-in-us-stocks-amid-weaker-flows](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/goldman-s-rubner-sees-correction-in-us-stocks-amid-weaker-flows)

The US stock market can flip into a correction territory as retail and institutional buyers are running out of steam, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner, the bank’s managing director for global markets and tactical specialist.

“The flow dynamics change dramatically starting Monday and I am on correction watch,” Rubner wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

US stocks hit a new record high on Wednesday despite uncertainty around tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path. Strong gains have been driven by resilient corporate earnings and strong flows from retail and institutional investors. But these dynamics could change starting from Monday, Rubner wrote.

Demand from retail traders, which have been piling into US stocks at a record pace this year, is expected to slow down ahead of the tax paying season in March. Flows from pension funds can also “run out of juice,” according to Rubner attributing it to seasonal trends. January and February are typically the strongest months of the year for yearly asset allocations, followed by weaker inflows in March.

Positioning across trend-following systematic funds also looks bearish. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, which buy or sell stocks depending on the market direction, are estimated to sell about $61 billion in US stocks over the next month should markets go lower, compared to only about $10 billion of buying in a bullish scenario.

On top of that, options market positioning also points to some volatility. According to Goldman’s estimates, dealers are currently long $9.8 billion of S&P 500 gamma, which acts as a market buffer when dealers are buying the dip. However, the bank’s index trading team estimates that 50% of this long gamma position rolls off Friday, and the market will have the ability to move more freely next week.

Looks like we're going to see a drop at least till the end of March. Looking forward to what people think!",2025-03-13,2,37

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple’s reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card. 

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren’t properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation. 

On top of that, Apple’s checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman’s Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn’t escape the CFPB’s scrutiny either. 

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren’t acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards. 

The situation was worsened by Goldman’s failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. 

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. 

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What’s Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. 

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. 

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. 

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. 

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What’s Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. 

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. 

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week fizzled out without much action on the economic front.

Durable goods—think cars, washing machines, and industrial robots (maybe) —are the heavy hitters of the manufacturing world. Tracking orders for these big-ticket items gives us a snapshot of how businesses are feeling about their future. Are they investing in long-term assets, or tightening the purse strings?

Economists are predicting a 1% drop in orders this month, a sign that the manufacturing sector is still stuck in a rut after last month’s flat performance. Looks like the industry's struggle bus isn’t pulling into the station just yet.",2024-10-25,4,0

Today GS (Goldman Sachs) reported strong earnings before market open. So I analyzed the quarter earnings report and I was confident that the stock would go up upon market open (see my analysis below), but it went in the exact opposite direction upon market as u can see below. So since im still learning, i have the following questions

- If the earnings report is strong as you can see in my below analysis, why did the stock nosedive upon market open, whats the market rational behind this?

- Could i have foreseen this in any way based on available information?

- What can i do differently moving forward?  
  
- Have i done everything correctly and is my rational for a stock increase justified or was i just prey for unrational short sellers?

- GS is not the only example where i had this issue of strong quarter earnings report, followed by the stock nosediving upon market open, this doesn;t make any sense, please can you guys give a bit of context?  


Many thanks!  
  
  
My analysis:

Positives:  
• Goldman Sachs exceeded analysts' profit estimates for the third quarter, driven by growth in bond sales, stock offerings, and mergers. This suggests the company is capitalizing on improving economic conditions and a more confident corporate client base.  
• Investment banking fees increased by 20% to $1.87 billion. This was primarily due to higher net revenues in debt underwriting from leveraged finance and investment-grade activity. Growth in equity underwriting was driven by secondary share sales.  
• The firm ranked #1 globally in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions, and common stock offerings year-to-date.  
• Asset and Wealth Management reported record quarterly management and other fees, with net revenues reaching $3.75 billion. This represents a 16% increase year-over-year.  
• Assets under supervision reached a record $3.10 trillion, increasing by $169 billion during the quarter.  
• The company's efficiency ratio improved to 64.3% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year.  
• Total profit surged by 45% to $2.99 billion, or $8.40 per share, exceeding analyst expectations of $6.89.

 Negatives:  
• Revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities trading declined by 12%.  
• The company recorded $397 million in provisions for credit losses, compared to $7 million a year earlier. This was mainly driven by higher charge-offs in its credit card portfolio.  
• Goldman Sachs incurred a one-time charge of $415 million due to the exit from its credit card venture with General Motors. The charge includes a writedown related to the transfer of the GM credit card business to Barclays.  
• The future of Goldman Sachs' credit card partnership with Apple is uncertain. JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in talks to replace Goldman Sachs as Apple's credit card partner.

Performance on key metrics:  
• Global Banking & Markets: Strong performance in equities and record quarterly net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing.  
• Asset & Wealth Management: Record quarterly management and other fees. Assets under supervision increased to a record $3.10 trillion.  
• Book value per common share: Increased by 1.8% during the quarter to $332.96.

Other noteworthy info from earning report  
• The Board of Directors declared a dividend of $3.00 per common share, payable on December 30, 2024.  
• Goldman Sachs returned $1.98 billion of capital to common shareholders during the quarter, including $1.00 billion in share repurchases and $978 million in dividends.

1e3szj1_GS,GS,Goldman Sachs tops estimates on better-than-expected fixed income trading ,"Goldman Sachs said Monday that it topped second-quarter profit and revenue estimates on better-than-expected fixed income results.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $8.62 per share vs. $8.34 per share LSEG estimate

Revenue: $12.73 billion vs. $12.46 billion estimate

Goldman said profit jumped 150% from a year earlier to $3.04 billion, or $8.62 per share; the bank’s results a year ago were hamstrung by write-downs tied to commercial real estate and the sale of a consumer business.

Companywide revenue rose a more modest 17% to $12.73 billion on growth in the bank’s core trading, advisory and asset and wealth management operations.

Fixed income was a highlight for the quarter; revenue there jumped 17% to $3.18 billion, roughly $220 million more than the StreetAccount estimate, on activity in interest rate, currency and mortgage trading markets.

Expectations have been set high for Goldman Sachs, with Wall Street businesses in the midst of a rebound after a dismal 2023.

That’s because out of the six biggest U.S. banks, Goldman is the most reliant on investment banking and trading to generate revenue.

Another focal point for the quarter will be in asset and wealth management, areas that Goldman CEO David Solomon has wagered can be a growth engine for the bank.

On Friday, rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both topped expectations thanks to surging investment banking fees and better-than-expected equities trading results.

Banking regulators on Friday [disclosed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240621a.htm) that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills — plans for unwinding huge institutions in the event of distress or failure — of [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) and [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) filed in 2023 were inadequate.

Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios. Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, [according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.

“An assessment of the covered company’s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm’s capabilities have material limitations,” regulators [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) of Citigroup.

The living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.

While JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America’s plans were each deemed to have a “shortcoming” by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious “deficiency” by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn’t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.

Since the Fed didn’t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious “shortcoming” grade.

“We are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,” New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.

“While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,” the bank said. “More broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.”",2024-06-21,108,7

“While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,” the bank said. “More broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.”",2024-06-21,59,6
1c4juck_GS,GS,Goldman Sachs earnings are out – Here are the numbers,"Goldman Sachs reported first-quarter earnings before the opening bell Monday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:

Earnings: $11.58 per share, vs. expected $8.56
Revenue: $14.21 billion, vs. expected $12.92 billion

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has taken his lumps in the past year, but hope is building for a turnaround.

Dormant capital markets and missteps tied to Solomon’s ill-fated push into retail banking should give way to stronger results this year.

Rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup posted better-than-expected trading results and a rebound in investment banking fees in the first quarter; investors will be disappointed if Goldman doesn’t show similar gains.

Unlike more diversified rivals, Goldman gets most of its revenue from Wall Street activities. That can lead to outsized returns during boom times and underperformance when markets don’t cooperate.

After pivoting away from retail banking, Goldman’s new emphasis for growth has centered on its asset and wealth management division. The business could see gains from buoyant markets at the start of the year, though it also has taken write-downs tied to commercial real estate in the past.

Solomon may also field questions about the latest examples of an exodus in senior managers, including his global treasurer Philip Berlinski and Beth Hammack, co-head of the bank’s global financing group.

On Friday, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo each posted quarterly results that topped estimates.

For 3-6 month overwrites, we highlight the top 50 opportunities based on our analysts’ price targets as well as the top 50 put selling candidates based on our analysts’ estimates.

* ***Call selling underperformed by 37bps while put selling outperformed by 50bps since Jan expiration.***  
We calculate the average return for a portfolio of 362 stocks in the US market that we believe are liquid (as identified by tight bid/ask spreads for 10% OTM calls). We observed that call selling outperformed a long stock strategy only in months with moderate to down stock performance, whereas put selling outperformed in most of the months except those with sharp market sell-offs. See Exhibit 2.
* ***Buy-write portfolio (call sale + long stock) is up 3.8% since Jan expiration.***  
We simulate owning stock and selling 10% OTM Feb calls as of Jan expiration. We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock overwriting has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 3.8% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%. See Exhibit 3.
* ***Put selling portfolio (put sale + long stock) is up 4.7% since Jan expiration.***  
We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock put selling has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 4.7% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%.

**We identify short-term overwriting opportunities (1 month) as well as longer-term overwriting opportunities (3-6 months) based on two primary methods->**

* ***Short-term overwrites (1 month): We focus on Events, Market Cap and implied volatility.***  
Our overwriting study shows that event timing and stock characteristics are particularly important factors for overwriting outperformance with short-term options. We identify stocks that do not report earnings prior to the next expiration where their market cap is in the top 2/3 of the universe and their implied volatility is also in the top 2/3. We have found that overwriting stocks with these characteristics has added over 500 bps over the past 16 years. See Exhibit 4.
* ***Longer-term overwrites (3-6 months): We focus on our analysts’ fundamental views.***  
While short-term volatility may drive a stock from its appropriate longer-term value, we believe that over a sufficiently long period of time, the stock should trend toward that value. We use our analysts’ price targets to identify those stocks where calls appear overpriced relative to our analysts’ estimate of where shares are likely to trade. This methodology is consistent with our “Buy-write monthly.” See Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6.
* ***Underwriting (6 months): Put-selling screen based on average support levels for EV/EBITDA, EV/SALES and P/FCF (6 months).***  
In this screen, we start with Buy-rated stocks from the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research coverage universe. The put strike to sell is derived from the average of downsides to the stock price in three scenarios where each of EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales and P/FCF reaches its 10%-ile value in last 10 years and is based on our analysts’ 12-month forward estimates for EBITDA, Sales, and FCF. See Exhibit 7.

Covered call sellers risk limiting upside to the strike price plus the option premium and dividends. Put sellers commit to buying shares at the strike price.

***All pricing and data that follow are as of Jan 27, 2022 close unless otherwise specified...***

* ***Recent outperformers may be good overwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the strongest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors may like to trim extreme upside exposure to these stocks and collect premium from selling calls, especially where the call premium looks attractive.
* ***Recent underperformers may be good underwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the weakest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors that expect the recent underperformance to abate may sell puts to generate yield, especially where the put premium is attractive.

**Over the past 18 years, Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis.**  
These strategies have become increasingly popular among investors, especially given the prospects of flat to negative equity markets. Options provide asymmetric exposure to the underlying asset, unlike stock or stock-like investments. This property helps provide a downside cushion to covered call sellers, in the form of a premium. This premium, especially when viewed in the context of a systematic strategy, is often viewed by investors as similar to interest or coupon payments, and leads to outperformance over stocks in flat to negative equity markets.

**Historical Performance of Systematic Overwriting strategies:**

1. We performed a detailed analysis of single stock overwriting over the past 18 years for S&P 500 companies. We find that a large variety of systematic overwriting strategies have higher Sharpe ratios than stock only portfolios and select strategies have also had higher total returns.
2. We estimate that selling 10% out-of-the-money 1 month covered calls on stocks with liquid options in the S&P 500 generated a compound annual return of 10.6% since 2003, **outperforming S&P 500 Total Return by 0.6% annually.**
3. Most of the Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, regardless of strike selection. The **Sharpe ratios across buy-write strategies ranged from 0.46 to 0.74, compared to 0.64 for the S&P 500 Total Return Index over the same period.**

1. **Outperformance was the largest in the Consumer Staples (270bps) sector.**  
On an absolute basis, the strongest performance was in Information Technology where a Buy write (10% OTM calls) strategy led to an annualized return of 13.5% over the past 16 years.
2. Overwriting added 170bps annually to the performance of the underlying Financial stocks, **boosting the annualized return from 4.6% to 6.3%.**

We avoid selling calls on these stocks, instead capturing stock-only returns for those names in the particular month, driven by our view that earnings are generally positive events for stocks.

The below exhibit compares annual returns of the earnings-adjusted covered call selling strategy with the strategy that includes earnings. We also show the ratio of average earnings-day moves vs. non-earnings days each year.

***Conclusion: with earnings days becoming more volatile relative to non-earnings days, avoiding earnings when overwriting systematically has led to higher returns.***

As global markets keenly await the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, analysts from Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM) came out with their expectations on how the headline inflation numbers could affect the benchmark US equity index S&P500.

JP Morgan appears more bullish on the S&P 500 as it expects the equity benchmark to rise by 2% to 3% in case the CPI YoY matches market forecasts ranging between 7.2% to 7.4%. That said, the US bank anticipates a rally between 8.0% and 10.0% in case the inflation figure arrives as 6.9% or lower.",2022-12-13,130,54

xlpzlk_GS,GS,Goldman Sachs insiders are fuming over their CEO's use of private jets to promote his side hustle as a DJ - Is this a real problem?,"Anyone been to a party with ***DJ Solomon***, otherwise known as ""***D-Sol""*** to those in EDM circles.  Apparently being a globally recognized DJ while Chief executive at the premier Wall Street investment bank has ruffled some feathers (you laugh but he has performed at Tomorrowland in 2019 and most recently Lollapalooza with One Republic front man Ryan Tedder).  Especially when you use the bank's private jet to travel to your DJ gigs.

Remember, **DJ Sol** was the guy a year ago who was trying to get people back to the office during CoVid shelter-in-place, and questioned analysts who complained about working 100 hour weeks nonstop and once got irritated when he was in the Hamptons during a work day and ran into junior GS bankers also dining at the same restaurant (story here:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-03-15/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-wants-his-bankers-back-at-the-office-kmasw2xe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-03-15/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-wants-his-bankers-back-at-the-office-kmasw2xe))

Per the latest business insider article, it seems there are growing concerns within GS about Solomon's **use of the private jet to attend DJing events, the amount of time he spents on building up his DJ-Sol personal brand, and his asking GS staffers to help with his DJing side gig.**

Everyone deserves to have a personal life outside the office, but is DJ Sol crossing the line?

My view: Liberal Democratic Party gains support in 10 Jul elections and moves ahead with Abenomics/hawkish foreign policy.

Follow up to [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8y7g/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/ifc4pgk/?context=3) from earlier this morning summarizing my own thoughts and incorporating comments from people who are smarter than me and my dog combined. For all intents and purposes, my dog came up with all of what follows and she doesn't even eat crayons. Her diet withstanding, none of the following is investment advice and you shouldn't listen to any of it because remember, a dog came up with all of it. She's a cute dog, but still a dog.

***From GS:***

NKY futures reached new lows, indicating down -1.4% prior to PM open and trading \~27% of the full days’ volumes by 12:10pm, while USDJPY tumbled back to 135 handle immediately after the release.

***From MS***

>**MS JPY Rates Daily July 8, 2022**\*:\*  
>  
>**JGB/Swap: Former PM** **Abe** \*\*shot - is that anything to do with Bo J?\*\*It was supposed to be a quiet Friday and indeed so before the shocking headline “JAPAN'S EX-PM ABE COLLAPSES IN NARA, SHOTS HEARD” hit the newswire just after the morning close. The initial reaction was a knee-jerk JB futures plunge hitting 148.94 (-0.53), as possibly the headline was associated with the termination of Abenomics and Kuroda-Abe relationship but the weakness was short-lived and trimmed almost all the losses into 3pm close after all. We also believe this is less to do with monetary policy as the current PM Kishida still continues Abe’s legacy / Abenomics and maintains good relationship with Kuroda. Flow wise, overnight session saw decent x-market paying in 5y5y on s dr and 10y LCH paid 3.75bps underperforming JB futures itself, whilst international rm managers were better buyer in sub-10y sector, which richened 5-10yr sector as w by 2-3bps. We would like to see more domestic rm managers activity after the upper house election this weekend, as BoJ is unlikely to move this month, so we prefer flattener (5y30y or 20y30y) and 30y a s w.**Vol:** Headline about post PM Mr.Abe has accelerated sell-off in delta in Afternoon session, JPY vol went well bid from front-end with little volume traded in market. 2y15y which is typical point where domestic sells, we saw short covering from domestic names, also 1m5y were paid up from usual gamma seller domestics. As risk events ahead of us together with uncertainty from sudden headlines, gamma is in strong needs everywhere.

***From me:***

There will be knock on effects consistent with an FX rate shift in the short term at least, curious if this will make it easier for the Liberal Democratic Party to get things done however (eg. restart nuclear power plants which would have a material impact on Japan's current account given how much they spend importing fossil fuels).

Trading some FX outright counting on JPY appreciation/flight to quality and buying 1) Japanese nuclear power complex + 2) military industrial complex (eg. defense contractors) + 3) Lockheed Martin to start. Abe is a firebrand very supportive of building up the military and expanding use of nuclear energy. I do think he is right in those priorities but with an election coming up in TWO days I’ve got to believe the public and the diet will be much more supportive.

u4ehc9_GS,GS,Lawyers representing Twitter shareholders are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. The investment bank predicted that TWTR shares would continue to decline in value over the next 12 months. After the board hired Goldman to advise them they are claiming Elon's offer is way too low!,"When the Twitter shareholder lawsuits begin the class action lawyers are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. Just two months ago [Goldman's Equity Research](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514726980909948928) team predicted that Twitter's share price would decline from $37.83 to $30.00 over the next twelves months and recommended their clients SELL the stock. This week Twitter's board hired Goldman Sachs to advise the board on Elon's $54.20 offer. Goldman is now [claiming](https://www.unseenopp.com/goldman-advisors-say-no-deal-to-musks-twitter-bid/) that Elon's offer was ""***too low to be taken seriously***"" despite that it is 81~~57~~% higher than their own price target for the stock. To be clear, I am not saying that GS will face any liability for their conflicting opinions but when the shareholder lawsuits come the lawyers will have a 'field day' deposing the research group and the advisory group. I am sure they will have lots of excuses - but they ever get in front of a jury it will be fun. I didn't realize how upset so many people would get by pointing this contradiction out.

I can always come back to GS later if I'm more successful elsewhere, as the portfolio cash will outperform GS's price movement.

I'm greedy and I think I can do even better. So my thoughts are that either I let GS be called or continue to roll it and keep the underlying. I figure I'll base my decision on tomorrow's performance. A healthy pullback would give me a great rolling opportunity but even if that's the case, there's other great line-ups that I could exploit if they don't rip until Monday.

So if relative to GS they don't rip, even if the pullback occurs it might be time to let go of GS.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you had fun during my absence! Earnings season is picking back up again, with banks leading the charge. We’ve got eight of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. Given that you’ve read my post on [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), or are well versed in theta gang strategies, there’s an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move relatively predictably post-earnings. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits.

#Summary and Conclusion

Eight of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-11,12,0

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don’t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There’s also a chance you’ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. 

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS.

*Nine* of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them.

oibls8_JPM,JPM,"Expected moves. SPCE, TSLA JPM, GS, BAC, WFC and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.

Looking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.

Those looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.8%**
* DIA **1.2%**

&#x200B;

### In the News

The Virgin Galactic flight with Richard Branson went off successfully. **SPCE** options are pricing about a **22%** move for this week.

There was a lot of attention paid to **Tesla TSLA** chart technicals and momentum last week. Here’s how the options market is pricing TSLA, with a one week expected move of more than **4%** and a one month expected move (that includes earnings) of about **12%.**

When I first signed up for Goldman Sachs “Marcus” app, I was impressed with the simplicity. The app is fast and sleek yet has all necessary bells and whistles. Something very “easy to use half asleep at 2 am”. You can send a one click wire. There’s a tracker that shows progress for any bonuses you’re eligible for. Their investment in simplicity compared to other, complicated apps made me move all of my savings to them, and I’d probably move my checking to them too when they launch that. 

I was recently surprised to find this again in a second company - Square’s cash app. The second I opened it for the first time, I likened it to a “fisher price app” - super simple to use, super simple to understand, clean interface - yet powerful.

I unfortunately can’t find a link to an article I read recently, but it showed that people are experiencing app overload and prefer 8-10 apps ... no more. I believe this trend towards simplicity will continue and would like to factor it into my investment decisions moving forward (for my “play” account).

lo039e_JPM,JPM,"DD. No one is talking about the student debt bubble! THIS COULD BE THE NEXT BIG SHOT.. SLM, NAVI, JPM, GS","Hey MFS, Ive been quite interested in this topic for the last 6 months.. so last couple weeks I have been gathering info. I cant believe that I haven’t heard anything here n WSB…

This is my f..kin research:

1-Student debt is about 1.6 trillion, which 92% is from the Federal Government and the rest is from private institucions (SLM and NAVI)

2- The private debt rises to 128 billions, and the institutions in charge of managing this debt (SLM & NAVI) have a market cap of 10B, which means that any little f..kin mistake coulf fck them up.

3-SLM and NAVI (specially SLM) are creating SLABS (student loans asset backed securities), which are the same shit as the mortages back in 2008. SLABS have a really optimistic rating despite the increasing unemployment rate, inflation, and ZERO credit score from the students (most of the students who gets students loans doesn’t even have a credit card or other credit instrument… which means that the student loan is the first credit in their lives without even having a credit background!)

4- The underwriter from the SLABS are JPM, GS, DEUTCHE, MORGAN, ETC… same institutions that didn’t give a fuck back in 2008.

5- Biden student debt relief could be quite beneficial for the student debt ecosystem… which means that SLM and NAVI would be the ones most beneficed, increasing their stock price to the moon.

6. I don’t get why no one is talking about this! THIS IS HAPPENING RN AND IT IS REAL!

I am buying 10k in LEAPS for 2023… what do you think about this topic? Wanna know if I am crazy or actually fckin right!

EDIT: SLM has started a BUYBACK of 1billion USD this month.. Which is equal to 20% aprox of it's actual market cap! NO FCKIN CLUE IF THIS IS GOOD OR NOT... ",2021-02-20,210,114

l8uu76_JPM,JPM,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

How about GINN? I see it's a pretty diversified passive ETF, with more than 450 holdings and only 60% in the US, seems a solid way to invest in innovation, while keeping down risks of more concentrated ARKK or similar.  

My only problem is the names they give to the themes guiding their stock selection: Data Driven World, Finance Reimagined, Human Evolution, Manufacturing Revolution, and New Age Consumer. 

Do they serve to hide bad management or hypothetical low returns?

# Description

Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.The Company operates through four segments: 

* Investment Banking
* Institutional Client Services, i.e. their equities and fixed income trading biz
* Investing & Lending, where they take positions themselves
* Investment Management

So from a financial services perspective, they pretty much do it all, except for offering direct-to-consumer products, though recently they've started to invest in that space.

## Recent financials 

Banks haven't had it easy since the financial crisis. Sob sob. Revenues have been stable, cashflows have been good, but they are still in the process of shrinking their balance sheets and are continually having to boost their equity base. i.e. less assets on the books having to serve a large equity base. Net net, it's hurting the return on equity :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $34bn | $35bn | $34bn | $34bn | $29bn|
|EPS | $12.1 | $17.1 | $15.5 | $14.1 | $7.5|
|RoE | 7% | 11%| 11% | 11% | 6%|

And if you look at split in revenue, there is the pure investment banking business which has been averaging at $30bn of sales the last 3 years, and the traditional banking model (interest income > expenses) which has earned $3 to 4bn a year. So you can see that it's the core investment banking business that's key to Goldmans success. 

## Competition

When it comes to the competition they point to a wide range of business models

> Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. 

But in the US it's the usual suspects that could be classified as the peers. And weirdly, the Return on Equity for GS is bottom of the class. Though it's pretty bunched and you gotta look to the advisory firms, with small balance sheets, to find any high returns businesses. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Goldman Sachs Group Inc | $36,369M | 7%
JPMorgan Chase & Co. | $54,590M  | 10%
Citigroup Inc | $57,540M | 6%
Wells Fargo & Co | $52,248M  | 12%
Bank of America Corp | $50,775M  | 6%
Morgan Stanley | $36,158M  | 7%
Lazard Ltd | $2,283M  | 35%
Evercore Partners Inc. | $1,418M  | 18%

## Cash / Debt?

Well there's really not a lot to say about cash / debt for a bank! That's their whole construct! Instead it's a good idea to work out how much ""assets"" i.e. loans do they have out to clients and what the ""capital"" base is, i.e. equity reserves. As any losses in the loans (""assets"") eat into the capital base (i.e. ""equity""). 

In fact Goldmans has over $500 billion of assets versus it's $70bn of equity. So at a 13% capital ratio, they are one of the better capitalized banks.

Though look at the figures, and marvel. Imagine, they need to have $500bn of ""loans"" out to clients to generate their $34bn of revenues. On this they make $6bn of profit. i.e. $6bn versus the $70bn of equity and $500bn+ of ""assets"".

So shed a tear, go on... it's a tough business to make a return, honest.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $206 target for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. Which is odd, since the stock would have to fall 8% to get to their target. 

Wow, imagine the Trump bounce has been especially sweet for investment banks. For most of 2016 GS traded between 10 and 12x earnings, but suddenly it's worth 14x.
 
# Valuation

Though the re-rating's been across the board. Everyone's feeling good about the banks.

EVR | $2,957M | 16x | 7% | 2% | 7%

Sure it's logical, but won't the long-term economics come through...smaller balance sheets, more equity continuing to depress return?

If banks become ""utilities"", boring rent-seekers, like telecoms businesses and utilities shouldn't they be rated that way? For example here's the largest bank v telco v utility in the US.

""Boring Utilities""|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
JPM | $291,986M | 14x | 5% | 2% | 6%
T | $237,104M | 14x | 9% | 5% | 22%
DUK | $50,582M | 16x | 2% | 5% | 17%

No major shock... except for the crappy dividends the finance utilities pay!

# Dividends

Goldman Sachs Group Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.60 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $15.60. On top of that they are allowed to repurchase stock, and they've done a good deal of it, all with the approval of the Federal Reserve.

# Catalysts

In the last 1 month the stock price has moved by 26% that compares with a flat the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales off 10% in the first 9 months. 

On to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CFO said

> While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. 

Which hardly inspires confidence. Especially when he follows it up with

> I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as well as preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. 

With the price above the consensus target, management showing little enthusiasm, and no sign of the economics of the investment banking business improving materially any time soon, I can't feel any love for the vampire squid's stock.

29p9ge_GS,GS,Why Has Goldman Sachs (GS) Lagged the Market this Year if M&A is at the Highest Level since 2007?,"* [M&A Stats](http://www.mergermarket.com/pdf/MergermarketTrendReport.Q12014.Global-FinancialAdvisorLeagueTables.pdf)

From the presentation:

* US M&A saw deals valued at US$ 277.8bn soaring 55.9% above Q1 2013 (US$ 
178.2bn) and 24.3% over Q4 2013 (US$ 223.5bn)
* Q1 2014 marked the highest valued first-quarter since Q1 2007 (US$ 361.4bn)

(The original title included Morgan Stanley (MS) as well but they are beating the market so I changed it.)

With the two largest free standing Investment Banks, wouldn't you think these should both be higher than they are?  

Here are their YTD performance vs the S&P500:

* S&P YTD: +8%
* S&P 1yr: +22%

* GS YTD: -6%
* GS 1yr: +11%

* MS YTD: +5%
* MS 1yr: +33%

OK never-mind I guess MS is doing better than I thought but you would think both companies should be blowing it out the water this year. Both companies are trading at just BV with GS at a slight premium.  

Is it mainly due to bond prices falling that is keeping them down?  Low volatility and little trading? 

When looking at GS 10-Q it looks like they had lower earnings due to a decline in ""Market Making"" and ""Other Principle Transactions.""  Could their Market Making section be due from holding bonds that have declined in value and no trading to make commissions from?

There was a major item in their Cash Flow statement that moved their Operating Cash Flow to a loss:

* Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes (10,509)

So is this money held for potential lawsuits?  Could this money be released back in the future?

It just doesn't make sense to me how both GS and MS are not substantially higher this year.

1b2qhc_GS,GS,Buffett to take 9.3M share position in GS instead of exercising warrants,"During the panic of 2008 Buffett came charging in (blood on the streets) and made some big investments.

The deal he gave GS in order to save their collective asses was that he would buy $5B worth of preferred stock and also get $5B in warrants that allow him to buy another $5B worth of common stock.

Needless to say, things have worked out pretty well since then.

>Almost five years later, as the warrants reach expiration in October 2013, the parties have amended the deal from the right to purchase 43,478,260 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, with an exercise price of $115, to ""the number of shares of common stock equal in value to the difference between the average closing price over the 10 trading days preceding Oct. 1, 2013 and the exercise price of $115 multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrant (43,478,260).""

>In other words, if Buffett exercised his warrants at $115 on Tuesday, when shares trade for $146, he would make a $1.35 billion profit. Instead, Goldman would give him approximately 9.23 million shares of the company - the equivalent value of cash, except in shares. Depending on the price in October, the deal will likely place Buffett as a long-term, top 10 shareholder in Goldman Sachs and make it approximately 12 or 13 th largest holding. Sachs' largest fund owner is value guru Dodge & Cox .

>""We intend to hold a significant investment in Goldman Sachs, a firm that I did my first transaction with more than 50 years ago,"" Buffett said the statement.
