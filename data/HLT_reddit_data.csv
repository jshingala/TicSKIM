1kon4ym_NET,NET,[HLT stock] Most of net worth in employee stock purchase program. Continue the course or diversify?,"
I have been putting 15% of my paycheck into the ESPP (employee stock purchase program), and have amassed almost 60k. The stock has been performing magnificently and I’m up 82% since I’ve started contributing in 2020. We can purchase the stock at a 15% discount based on the closing price at the beginning or end of the “purchase period,” which is six months.

HLT seems to be insulated fairly well as it operates on a franchise and service-based business model. Of course we’re affected by tarriffs and the current economic environment, but I’m still extremely bullish on the stock.

Should I continue to maximize my contribution and have that be my *main* receptacle of savings? I feel like it’s just *too good* of a deal right now. I do want to maximize my Roth but this just seems to be such a greater opportunity of return.

35/m. Making ~95-100k. Rent is 1785/month. No material debt.

It's now only $59 billion shy of surpassing [McDonald's by market cap](https://assetdash.com/).

hp10qk_HLT,HLT,MAR and HLT and other hotel stocks,"Hello friends,
I am a director for a major hotel franchise company and my role revolves around micro and macro economics. I set prices and look at forecasted data for a living in many markets. I want to bring to your attention major concern for hoteliers around the USA and globe. This also probably ties in to airlines. Our city hotel concerns are that a lot of the weekday business will never come back. This accounts for 60% of our overall travel at many of our hotels. Corporations are telling us it will not come back this year, if ever. Zoom is saving them too much money. And why travel if you don’t have to. Covid has majorly changed the travel game for the worst. And i suspect it will for the long term. We are bidding on 2021 corporate accounts and it’s a blood bath for business. Everyone is lowballing each other. What little biz travel there is, it’ll be at a fraction of the price from 2019. This also goes for group business. Think conventions, weddings, etc. The lowballing was so bad, Marriott turned off their RFP season and told their clients “we are extending you 2020 rates for 2021!!” to stop the bleeding. Didn’t help. The hotels are contacting the clients outside of the RFP system to try to lowball and get whatever they can get. This whole thing is the worst case scenario for city hotels. I do expect a stock price increase as vaccines are announced and advanced to phase 3 and ultimately to the public but once 2021 end of Q1-3 financials are announced it’ll still be VERY ugly. This industry is not forecasted to be back to 2019 numbers mid/late 2023. Best of health and luck to all.
 
Tl;dr - Hotel chain stocks are going to get crushed and are not expected to rebound until mid/late 2023 per many expert forecast hotel analysts like myself in the field. There will be some green days as it relates to vaccine news and reopening but 2021 is going to low corporate Monday-Thursday business travel. 

Edit: added tl;dr and fixed typos",2020-07-11,49,17
hgatkj_HLT,HLT,Hilton and Mariott,"Hilton (HLT) is at 70.4$ and Marriott (MAR) at 81$ 

I know the hotel industry is not a safe bet for the short term, as well as many hotel chains are going bankrupt but those chains are some of the biggest players in the industry, therefore will surely recover from the pandemic 3-4-5 years from now, going back to 110$+ per share. 

Any insights would be great!",2020-06-26,1,4

gehoar_HLT,HLT,Is Hilton Hotels (HLT) worth punting on some puts for earnings?,"Hilton Hotels (HLT) report earnings before the opening bell on Thursday. The stock price has dropped about 38% from 113.23 on 14th Feb before the 'rona down to 71.74 at time of posting.

You would think that Q1 would have terrible results, but the question could be is that already priced in and will any forward positivity of the country opening up and business as usual help keep the price pegged around the 70 mark?

Hilton currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -21.12%.

**05/15 70P x5** might be worth a punt if the stock can drop\~4% to 68.67 and would give a \~50% return. Is there enough volume on the stock to play this? Thoughts?",2020-05-06,13,19
ftew3h_HLT,HLT,Bill Ackman bought Hilton (HLT). I think Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) is better.,"Hi everyone, we just to share our diligence on Hilton (HLT) and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc (PK).

PK is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds the real estate property that HLT uses. PK was spun out to make HLT an asset-light company. According to HLT's 2019 annual report, it only owned $380M in property. 

We believe PK is a significantly better buy than HLT for the following reasons:

1. PK is currently valued at $1.8B while its real estate value minus all liabilities equal $5B. There is a significant discrepancy between PK's market value and the intrinsic value of the real estate it holds. On the other hand, HLT is valued at $17B. However, HLT holds $10B in goodwill and brand value on its balance sheet. PK is a better buy because it holds more real value than HLT.

2. PK is currently 77% down from its 52-week high compared to HLT which is 45% down from its 52-week high. PK is a better buy because it has significantly higher upside than HLT.

3. PK historically pays $0.43 - $1.00 per share in dividends compared to HLT which historically pays $0.07 - $0.15 per share. HLT has suspended dividend payments while PK has not definitively suspended dividend payments yet. 

4. PK currently has $4.8B in liabilities while HLT has $15.5B in liabilities. PK is well able to cover its liabilities with $11B in assets while HLT cannot cover its liabilities with $15B in assets. 

In summary, both PK and HLT have >$1B in cash on hand or option to withdraw from their revolving credit facility and will likely be able to survive the COVID-19 crisis. However, PK is a much better investment than HLT for those interested in playing the upside in the hospitality industry. We are very bullish on PK and will continue investing in the REIT.",2020-04-02,17,33
