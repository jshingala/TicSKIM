# Bags Will No Longer Fly Free on Southwest Airlines

Southwest just kissed its most iconic perk goodbye. After more than 50 years of letting customers check two bags for free, the airline announced Tuesday that it will start charging baggage fees on tickets purchased after May 28. Investors loved it—Southwest stock soared 8.34%—but customers are already threatening to pack their bags and head elsewhere.

**No More Free Ride**  
  
“Bags fly free” wasn’t just a policy—it was Southwest’s identity. CEO Bob Jordan even said last summer that free checked bags were the “number one reason” customers chose the airline. But after Elliott Management muscled its way onto Southwest’s board last fall, the focus has shifted from customer loyalty to boosting revenue. Passengers without top-tier loyalty status or business fares will soon have to cough up a fee for checked bags, putting Southwest in line with its rivals.

**Wall Street’s Loving It**  
  
The financial logic is simple: US airlines raked in over $5 billion in baggage fees last year, with most carriers charging around $35 a pop. That’s easy money, especially as Southwest looks to cut $1 billion in costs after recent layoffs, route reductions, and hiring freezes. Investors rewarded the move, sending shares soaring even as Delta tanked 7.25% after slashing its earnings outlook due to weakening demand.

**Customers? Not So Much**  
  
Flyers were quick to vent. One viral post on X called the change “the stupidest thing they could do to ruin the company.” Aviation analyst Bill McGee piled on, saying, “Southwest has the strongest customer loyalty in an industry with almost no loyalty. This could destroy that.” Even Delta’s president admitted the move is “a big opportunity” to poach Southwest’s once-loyal customer base.

**Strategic or Self-Destructive?** Jordan insists the math checks out, claiming that fresh customer behavior data justified the change. But Southwest now faces the risk of alienating the very customers who stuck with it through turbulence. Without free bags, Southwest looks a lot more like its competitors—and for many travelers, that might be reason enough to look elsewhere.

# Nissan Replaces CEO After Failed Honda Merger

Nissan is switching drivers after its failed merger with Honda left the company skidding. Ivan Espinosa, Nissan’s chief planning officer, will take over as CEO on April 1, replacing Makoto Uchida, the automaker announced Tuesday. Espinosa has his work cut out for him: Nissan’s stock is down over 40% since Uchida took over in 2019, and the company’s latest earnings report showed a 94% drop in net income.

**A Merger Gone Wrong**  
  
The Honda-Nissan tie-up was supposed to create a $60 billion automotive powerhouse to compete with Toyota and fend off rising Chinese rivals like BYD. But the deal fell apart in February when Honda pushed to make Nissan a subsidiary and shut down some factories. Uchida balked at losing Nissan’s autonomy, and the deal unraveled—leaving Nissan without a clear path forward. Uchida admitted that voices of doubt had been growing louder internally, and the company’s deteriorating financials ultimately made his position untenable.

**Espinosa Takes the Wheel**  
  
Espinosa, 46, has been with Nissan since 2003 and knows the company inside and out. As chief planning officer, he’s overseen future product strategy, but now he’ll need to focus on damage control. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs and slash production capacity by 20%, but analysts say it will take more than cost-cutting to fix the company’s competitive and financial problems. Espinosa hasn’t laid out specific plans yet, but securing a strategic partner—possibly Foxconn—is likely high on his list.

**Renault to the Rescue?** Renault, which holds a 36% stake in Nissan, welcomed Espinosa’s appointment. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said Nissan needs to “find the strength to get back on its feet,” signaling that Renault could deepen ties if Nissan can stabilize. Renault’s recent restructuring gives Nissan more independence, but also leaves it more vulnerable without a solid backup plan.

**No Margin for Error:** Nissan has fallen behind rivals in EVs and hybrids, and it’s losing market share in both the US and China. The company is expected to post an annual net loss of around ¥80 billion ($550 million). Espinosa’s product expertise gives Nissan a shot at a turnaround—but without a financial lifeline or a breakthrough product, Nissan could be headed for more trouble.

This is Nissan’s fourth CEO change in eight years. If Espinosa can’t steer the ship, Nissan could be looking at more than just a leadership shakeup—it could be looking at a takeover.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s spotlight is on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the last big inflation check before the Fed huddles up next week to talk rates. Economists are expecting February’s headline CPI to rise 0.3% from January, cooling the annual rate to 2.9% from 3.0%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is also projected to climb 0.3% monthly and 3.2% annually.

But those forecasts come with an asterisk. The looming threat of tariffs has pushed companies to front-load imports and bump up prices, which could throw a wrench in the inflation data. All eyes are on whether the Fed will stay the course or shift its game plan.

* **Adobe** is trying to thread the needle in the AI race, giving away tools like Firefly for free to lure users now and (hopefully) cash in later. But while it’s building goodwill, free AI alternatives are already eating into Adobe’s bread-and-butter subscription businesses. That leaves Adobe stuck in the middle, and shareholders are feeling the squeeze. Without a clear path to monetize its AI strategy, investors are left wondering how long the company can keep walking this tightrope. ($ADBE)",2025-03-11,6,0
1hkkzy9_V,V,Honda and Nissan officially start merger talks ,"Honda and Nissan have officially begun merger talks, partially aimed at competing with Tesla and Chinese companies in the ev space. If completed the merger would make the third largest auto company in the world. The two companies currently have an MoU for the proposed merger. The tentative merger deal is looking to close June of 2025. The leadership would be largely decimated by Honda, and could include a reciprocal manufacturing agreement to use one another’s plants. 



Nissan has been struggling under heavy debt and lackluster revenue and most recently announced significant layoffs after a 93% profit plunge. Honda can be seeing this as more of an acquisition than a merger as they aim to swoop in and help Nissan achieve a “v shaped recovery” from their recent downturn. 



The completed merger could reset the stage for major auto makers and present serious competition for American car companies. Looking forward to watching this develop and see what the impacts will be. Honda does have some U.S. manufacturing but also has plants in Mexico, Canada, and Japan making discussions of what if any tariffs they could face another piece of the landscape.

# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs

Honda and Nissan—two of Japan’s auto heavyweights—are reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.

**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**

Talks are still in the “what if we…” phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan’s 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan’s most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota’s 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.

For Nissan, it’s a much-needed tow. The automaker’s operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment—two essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.

**The Toyota Problem**

Toyota has been eating everyone’s lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China’s BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.

Still, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There’s overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, “They might share the road, but they’re not always driving in the same direction.”

**Markets Hit the Gas**

Investors love a comeback story, and Nissan’s stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda’s dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.

If this sounds like déjà vu, that’s because Nissan’s been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France’s Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan’s searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.

**The Big Picture:** In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they’d become the David to Toyota’s Goliath—a true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.

# Dow’s Nine-Day Slide — Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream “historic slump,” the story under the hood isn’t quite as dire—though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What’s Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let’s talk about the index’s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump’s recent vow to “knock out” healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you’ve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn’t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar—which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending—have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here’s the kicker: the Dow’s funk isn’t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow’s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow’s losses aren’t a reflection of the broader market—it’s more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here’s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That’s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors’ side. December’s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a “pause that refreshes,” as some strategists like to say—especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow’s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let’s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow’s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow’s losses aren’t a reflection of the broader market—it’s more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here’s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That’s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors’ side. December’s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a “pause that refreshes,” as some strategists like to say—especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow’s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let’s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs

Honda and Nissan—two of Japan’s auto heavyweights—are reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.

**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**

Talks are still in the “what if we…” phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan’s 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan’s most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota’s 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.

For Nissan, it’s a much-needed tow. The automaker’s operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment—two essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.

**The Toyota Problem**

Toyota has been eating everyone’s lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China’s BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.

Still, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There’s overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, “They might share the road, but they’re not always driving in the same direction.”

**Markets Hit the Gas**

Investors love a comeback story, and Nissan’s stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda’s dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.

If this sounds like déjà vu, that’s because Nissan’s been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France’s Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan’s searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.

**The Big Picture:** In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they’d become the David to Toyota’s Goliath—a true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.

# Dow’s Nine-Day Slide — Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream “historic slump,” the story under the hood isn’t quite as dire—though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What’s Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let’s talk about the index’s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump’s recent vow to “knock out” healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you’ve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn’t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar—which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending—have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here’s the kicker: the Dow’s funk isn’t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance.

# Dow’s Nine-Day Slide — Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream “historic slump,” the story under the hood isn’t quite as dire—though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What’s Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let’s talk about the index’s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump’s recent vow to “knock out” healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you’ve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn’t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar—which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending—have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here’s the kicker: the Dow’s funk isn’t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow’s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow’s losses aren’t a reflection of the broader market—it’s more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here’s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That’s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors’ side. December’s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a “pause that refreshes,” as some strategists like to say—especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow’s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let’s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Sure, tomorrow we'll get some housing stats—like new builds and building permits—to gauge where the real estate supply is heading. But let's face it, the main event is the Fed.

The Federal Open Market Committee is wrapping up its last meeting of the year, and the market's betting big (over 95% odds) on another interest rate cut. But here's the kicker: this might be the final slice for a while, especially with 2025's uncertainties casting a shadow. Jerome Powell's words have been market movers all year, so tomorrow's decision feels like the grand finale in this monetary saga.

# After Market Close: 

* **Micron Technology** has been lagging behind its semiconductor peers, but investors are banking on brighter days ahead. Unlike Nvidia, Micron doesn’t make GPUs; it’s all about the memory market, where demand is expected to boom as AI continues to evolve. Wall Street hasn’t lost faith despite a sluggish year—23 out of 24 analysts still have a “buy” rating on the stock, with just one cautious “hold” in the mix. Now it’s up to Micron to prove them right. Consensus: $1.76 EPS, $8.55 billion in revenue. ($MU)",2024-12-18,1,0

One of the highlights of the annual Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin. Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now. The brand with the second highest operating margin, BMW, is a few percentage points below Tesla’s +15% operating margin. Third-placed Daimler, at 10%, isn’t even close!

rahqzd_HMC,HMC,"$ROCK, $HMC, and other companies that hired the most employees in November","Hola guys, what about your Christmas mood? And are you ready to meet the so-called ""January effect"" and spend your money on investments?

I decided to conduct research on the growth alternative data metrics for all US public companies over November to let your end-of-the-year investments decisions be more balanced and data-driven. I'll analyze top companies by such indicators as: the number of employees growth on LinkedIn, website traffic growth, insiders buying/selling activity growth, and other useful data points and insights.

The hiring dynamics over the past month had huge volumes, let's see which companies hired **the most employees in November**:

**1.** **Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (**[**$ROCK**](https://contora.ai/ticker/rock)**)** \- a company that manufactures and distributes building products for the renewable energy, conservation, residential, and infrastructure markets in North America and Asia.

https://preview.redd.it/e1rmelqhlz381.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=728d13f53cc08c8fa951f2296c6c0ac54e335b20

The reason for such a sharp increase in the number of employees may lie in the announcement made by $ROCK on November 8 - RBI Solar, SolarBOS, Sunfig and TerraSmart, all part of the renewable energy group of Gibraltar, announced they are unifying under a shared brand, **Terrasmart**, to deliver a seamless customer experience through integrated product lines and services. Fusing the history, experience, and strengths of four brands, the new Terrasmart will provide leading solar technologies and smart solutions across the project lifecycle to mitigate risks and amplify returns for solar projects of any size, type, and location. With a combined installed capacity of 19 GWs across 4,600 projects, Terrasmart is poised to power progress for commercial and utility PV sectors, making solar more profitable and accessible.

**2.** **Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (**[**$HMC**](https://contora.ai/ticker/hmc)**)** \- Honda develops, manufactures, and distributes motorcycles, automobiles, power products, and other products in Japan, North America, Europe, Asia, and internationally.

https://preview.redd.it/z4sbnivwkz381.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aea9dd244e2fa7bd1cb898efaf037842278b74b

On November 18, $HMC said its Japanese car factories will return to normal operations in December, after working at around 90% capacity this month due to a shortage of chips and supply disruptions from COVID-19 lockdowns overseas.

The two domestic production sites will return to normal capacity in the first half of December, Honda said in a statement.

nruxh0_HMC,HMC,HMC (Honda) is INSANELY undervalued,"I’m just gonna preface this by saying I love movies, and I love gaming *rockets*. 

That said, HMC (Honda) is trading UNDER its book value. Easily a 30% upward move would be a correction. It’s stock is practically illiquid with the volume on it. Options are insanely cheap. It’s PE ratio is saying it’s massively undervalued. If Honda was trading with similar metrics to Toyota it would more than double. 

I really can’t think of any good reason that Honda isn’t trading above $80. Legitimately. I recognize that my brain is smoother than the paint on Hondas, but even my crayon filled mouth is screaming to buy HMC at everybody. Awesome dividend by the way.

lm6krs_HMC,HMC,"HMC (Honda) is massively overlooked, with huge upside potential","I've always loved Honda cars, and recently took a position in HMC after looking over their financials.

When you look at their financials, and how that relates to their stock price, it's pretty amazing that they aren't trading *way* higher. I should disclose that this is using the year data ending 3/31/20 for HMC (I know, a bit old, but you'll see why it doesn't really matter):

Current Market Price: $29.17

Book Value per Share: $43.19

PE Ratio: 5.04

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68

2020 Estimated Shipped Cars: 4.5M

Gross Profit: $29.1B

Let's just stop for a second after those figures. The one metric that is truly astounding is HMC is trading *below* it's book value. Honda is one of the largest automotive and motorcycle manufacturers in the world, aside from other products, and yet it trades below its book value. Call me crazy, but even if all it did was reach its book value, you would see a 48% upside. That's already good enough for me.

Now let's talk PE ratio. The current S&P500 PE ratio is right around 40, give or take a bit on when you calculate it out. That's definitely high compared to historical numbers, and there are a whole host of reasons for that that I won't get into. The average S&P500 PE ratio for the past twenty years is 24.9, and its just above 20.1 for the past ten years. With that in mind, HMC's PE ratio of 5 is laughably low. Even if it gets to the S&P500 ten year average PE ratio, which wouldn't even be high by any standard, you're looking at a 298% increase in share price.

Alright, so we're already looking at easy upside from those two metrics, let's slap on another one for good measure - market value/book value. As I mentioned before, you're looking at a 48% upside if the stock price just gets to it's book value. Here's the thing - many stocks these days, including HMC's competitors trade well above their book value. Toyota, for instance, trades at about a 2.6 market/book ratio. If Honda did that, it's share price would be $112.65 right now. Honestly, that seems far more reasonable than where it's at now.

So, even with just those few metrics, it seems clear that Honda is massively undervalued, but it's fun to compare it to the all-scary monster of a stock, TSLA. Take a look at those same metrics and figures again:

Current Market Price: $29.17 vs TSLA at $798.15

Book Value per Share: $43.19 vs TSLA at $24.04

PE Ratio: 5.04 vs TSLA at 1246.88

Market Value divided by Book Value: 0.68 vs. TSLA at 33.19

2020 Shipped Cars: 4.5M (est) vs. TSLA at 500k

Gross Profit: $29.1B vs. TSLA at $6.6B

That's right, HMC has a higher book value than TSLA, and not by some measly margin. TSLA's astounding PE ratio is just outright scary, and that's the type of information that makes Michael Burry's short of TSLA not so crazy, even if he does have a price target of $100 (nearly a 90% loss). That doesn't stop me from having TSLA shares though, which brings me to my next point.

Investor sentiment seems to mean more than anything right now, and HMC has none. It only takes a quick look at trade volume in the last 6 weeks to see that:

TSLA: 925M vs. HMC: 20.2M

My view on sentiment is that it has a lot of power, and sentiment generally sticks for companies that are going places. In my mind it's partly what drove AMZN and TSLA share prices to such insane levels, and not to mention GME. If you look at the 5-year chart for HMC you don't see much sentiment at all. HMC is a safe haven, and seemingly forever a stock that you could sell Iron Condors on just picking up cash. That could all change if people start to catch on that HMC is primed and ready to do *whatever the f it wants* with the $25B it has in cash.

So, here's where I stand. Getting to $43 (book value) would be a correction. Getting to $108 would make it on par with market and similar to Toyota, which I could also view as a correction. If it catches investor sentiment, well, buckle up.

**TL;DR: HMC is massively undervalued by any metric. Upside of at least 50%-300% is more than reasonable, it would be a correction. Comparing it to TSLA is hilarious. Solid financials priming it ready to make moves and catch investor sentiment.**

Positions: 150 shares HMC, 4 shares TSLA. Not financial advice, just providing my own personal view to get some feedback.",2021-02-17,164,114

This is a very interesting report on the financing arm of the automotive industry.

Some interesting bits to take away:

* Page 18: As the housing bubble was popping (07-09), the average loan credit scores were reaching their peek, since then, they've declined steadily during the recovery. Credit scores of loans are now approximately what they were in 2007.

* Overall, Financing seems to be more popular as a method of paying for a car (pg. 29). People are willing to pay higher amounts per month than they were previously.

* Buy Here Pay Here (BHPH), where the local dealer themselves makes the loan to the customer, is becoming much less popular.

* Page 31 & 33: Captive Auto Loans (made by the auto manufacturer themselves to the buyer, such as Ford and Toyota) have similar delinquency rates as banks. Financing companies have by far the highest delinquency rates, but the rate has come down significantly from 3Q-2014 to 3Q-2015
