# Amazon Plans To Spend $100 Billion This Year To Capture ‚ÄòOnce In A Lifetime Opportunity‚Äô In AI

Amazon is pouring a record $100 billion into AI this year, but even that might not be enough to keep up. CEO Andy Jassy warned that AWS‚Äîthe company‚Äôs crown jewel‚Äîcould grow faster if not for delays in data center construction and chip supply shortages. This mirrors Microsoft‚Äôs recent admission that it also lacks the infrastructure to fully capitalize on AI demand. Jassy says these issues should ease by late 2025, but for now, Amazon‚Äôs AI ambitions are hitting a supply-side speed bump.

**AWS Growth: Solid, But Stuck**  
  
AWS revenue climbed 19% last quarter to $28.8 billion, marking the third straight quarter of identical growth. While that‚Äôs impressive, Wall Street wanted to see acceleration, not a plateau. Investors were expecting AI demand to supercharge AWS, but instead, supply constraints are keeping a lid on expansion. The stock fell 4% in after-hours trading as Amazon‚Äôs Q1 revenue guidance came in below expectations, even though total sales rose 10% to $187.8 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce unit continues to fend off Walmart, Temu, and Shein, with a little help from new U.S. trade rules that crack down on Chinese discount retailers.

**The AI Arms Race Just Got Pricier**  
  
Amazon isn‚Äôt alone in its spending spree‚ÄîAlphabet is set to drop $75 billion on AI infrastructure this year, Microsoft is earmarking $80 billion, and Meta is throwing in $65 billion. But the biggest shock came from China‚Äôs DeepSeek, an AI startup that claims to have built a ChatGPT rival in just two months on a shoestring budget. That revelation spooked investors, wiping $800 billion off the market caps of Nvidia and Broadcom last week. It also raises questions about whether Amazon and its Big Tech peers are spending wisely‚Äîor just throwing cash at the AI hype cycle.

**Amazon‚Äôs Long Game**  
  
Jassy insists that AI is a ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime‚Äù opportunity and that Amazon‚Äôs massive spending will pay off in the long run. But with growth bottlenecks, rising competition, and investors starting to scrutinize AI budgets more closely, the pressure is on. For now, Amazon remains one of the biggest players in the AI race‚Äîbut unless it can solve its supply issues, it might not be the fastest.

# Honeywell to Break Up After Pressure From Activist Elliott

Being a sprawling industrial conglomerate isn‚Äôt as cool as it used to be. Honeywell is officially breaking itself up into three independent companies: aerospace, automation, and advanced materials. The decision comes after activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $5 billion stake last year and called for a split, arguing that Honeywell‚Äôs complex structure was holding back its stock price. Investors initially cheered the move, but reality hit fast‚Äîshares fell 6% after Honeywell‚Äôs 2025 forecast came in weaker than expected.

**What‚Äôs Staying and What‚Äôs Going**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs aerospace division, which supplies aircraft parts and systems, will become one of the largest public aerospace companies post-split. It brought in $15 billion in revenue last year and will finally get to stand alone. The automation unit, which sells warehouse robotics and smart energy systems, is the company‚Äôs largest segment with $18 billion in revenue. The smallest of the three, advanced materials, had $4 billion in sales and was already in the process of being spun off before Elliott pushed for a broader split. The breakup is expected to be completed by the second half of 2026.

**The End of the Conglomerate Era**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs move is part of a broader trend‚Äîbig industrial giants are ditching the all-in-one business model. General Electric pulled off a similar split, spinning off its energy and healthcare units and unlocking more than four times its pre-breakup value. Investors have been pushing for leaner, more specialized companies, and Honeywell is just the latest to cave to that pressure. A breakup could boost Honeywell‚Äôs enterprise value by as much as $32 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, though history shows that not all spin-offs are immediate winners.

**What‚Äôs Next?**¬†While Elliott is celebrating, the real test is whether these three new companies can deliver better returns than Honeywell did as a single entity. CEO Vimal Kapur acknowledged that aerospace, in particular, has been ""diverging more and more"" from the rest of the business, making the split logical. But with a softer-than-expected outlook for 2025 and concerns about entering ‚Äúdeal purgatory‚Äù until the split is finalized, investors might need patience before seeing the full payoff.

# Honeywell to Break Up After Pressure From Activist Elliott

Being a sprawling industrial conglomerate isn‚Äôt as cool as it used to be. Honeywell is officially breaking itself up into three independent companies: aerospace, automation, and advanced materials. The decision comes after activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $5 billion stake last year and called for a split, arguing that Honeywell‚Äôs complex structure was holding back its stock price. Investors initially cheered the move, but reality hit fast‚Äîshares fell 6% after Honeywell‚Äôs 2025 forecast came in weaker than expected.

**What‚Äôs Staying and What‚Äôs Going**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs aerospace division, which supplies aircraft parts and systems, will become one of the largest public aerospace companies post-split. It brought in $15 billion in revenue last year and will finally get to stand alone. The automation unit, which sells warehouse robotics and smart energy systems, is the company‚Äôs largest segment with $18 billion in revenue. The smallest of the three, advanced materials, had $4 billion in sales and was already in the process of being spun off before Elliott pushed for a broader split. The breakup is expected to be completed by the second half of 2026.

**The End of the Conglomerate Era**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs move is part of a broader trend‚Äîbig industrial giants are ditching the all-in-one business model. General Electric pulled off a similar split, spinning off its energy and healthcare units and unlocking more than four times its pre-breakup value. Investors have been pushing for leaner, more specialized companies, and Honeywell is just the latest to cave to that pressure. A breakup could boost Honeywell‚Äôs enterprise value by as much as $32 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, though history shows that not all spin-offs are immediate winners.

**What‚Äôs Next?**¬†While Elliott is celebrating, the real test is whether these three new companies can deliver better returns than Honeywell did as a single entity. CEO Vimal Kapur acknowledged that aerospace, in particular, has been ""diverging more and more"" from the rest of the business, making the split logical. But with a softer-than-expected outlook for 2025 and concerns about entering ‚Äúdeal purgatory‚Äù until the split is finalized, investors might need patience before seeing the full payoff.

# Amazon Plans To Spend $100 Billion This Year To Capture ‚ÄòOnce In A Lifetime Opportunity‚Äô In AI

Amazon is pouring a record $100 billion into AI this year, but even that might not be enough to keep up. CEO Andy Jassy warned that AWS‚Äîthe company‚Äôs crown jewel‚Äîcould grow faster if not for delays in data center construction and chip supply shortages. This mirrors Microsoft‚Äôs recent admission that it also lacks the infrastructure to fully capitalize on AI demand. Jassy says these issues should ease by late 2025, but for now, Amazon‚Äôs AI ambitions are hitting a supply-side speed bump.

**AWS Growth: Solid, But Stuck**  
  
AWS revenue climbed 19% last quarter to $28.8 billion, marking the third straight quarter of identical growth. While that‚Äôs impressive, Wall Street wanted to see acceleration, not a plateau. Investors were expecting AI demand to supercharge AWS, but instead, supply constraints are keeping a lid on expansion. The stock fell 4% in after-hours trading as Amazon‚Äôs Q1 revenue guidance came in below expectations, even though total sales rose 10% to $187.8 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce unit continues to fend off Walmart, Temu, and Shein, with a little help from new U.S. trade rules that crack down on Chinese discount retailers.

**The AI Arms Race Just Got Pricier**  
  
Amazon isn‚Äôt alone in its spending spree‚ÄîAlphabet is set to drop $75 billion on AI infrastructure this year, Microsoft is earmarking $80 billion, and Meta is throwing in $65 billion. But the biggest shock came from China‚Äôs DeepSeek, an AI startup that claims to have built a ChatGPT rival in just two months on a shoestring budget. That revelation spooked investors, wiping $800 billion off the market caps of Nvidia and Broadcom last week. It also raises questions about whether Amazon and its Big Tech peers are spending wisely‚Äîor just throwing cash at the AI hype cycle.

**Amazon‚Äôs Long Game**  
  
Jassy insists that AI is a ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime‚Äù opportunity and that Amazon‚Äôs massive spending will pay off in the long run. But with growth bottlenecks, rising competition, and investors starting to scrutinize AI budgets more closely, the pressure is on. For now, Amazon remains one of the biggest players in the AI race‚Äîbut unless it can solve its supply issues, it might not be the fastest.

# Amazon Plans To Spend $100 Billion This Year To Capture ‚ÄòOnce In A Lifetime Opportunity‚Äô In AI

Amazon is pouring a record $100 billion into AI this year, but even that might not be enough to keep up. CEO Andy Jassy warned that AWS‚Äîthe company‚Äôs crown jewel‚Äîcould grow faster if not for delays in data center construction and chip supply shortages. This mirrors Microsoft‚Äôs recent admission that it also lacks the infrastructure to fully capitalize on AI demand. Jassy says these issues should ease by late 2025, but for now, Amazon‚Äôs AI ambitions are hitting a supply-side speed bump.

**AWS Growth: Solid, But Stuck**  
  
AWS revenue climbed 19% last quarter to $28.8 billion, marking the third straight quarter of identical growth. While that‚Äôs impressive, Wall Street wanted to see acceleration, not a plateau. Investors were expecting AI demand to supercharge AWS, but instead, supply constraints are keeping a lid on expansion. The stock fell 4% in after-hours trading as Amazon‚Äôs Q1 revenue guidance came in below expectations, even though total sales rose 10% to $187.8 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce unit continues to fend off Walmart, Temu, and Shein, with a little help from new U.S. trade rules that crack down on Chinese discount retailers.

**The AI Arms Race Just Got Pricier**  
  
Amazon isn‚Äôt alone in its spending spree‚ÄîAlphabet is set to drop $75 billion on AI infrastructure this year, Microsoft is earmarking $80 billion, and Meta is throwing in $65 billion. But the biggest shock came from China‚Äôs DeepSeek, an AI startup that claims to have built a ChatGPT rival in just two months on a shoestring budget. That revelation spooked investors, wiping $800 billion off the market caps of Nvidia and Broadcom last week. It also raises questions about whether Amazon and its Big Tech peers are spending wisely‚Äîor just throwing cash at the AI hype cycle.

**Amazon‚Äôs Long Game**  
  
Jassy insists that AI is a ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime‚Äù opportunity and that Amazon‚Äôs massive spending will pay off in the long run. But with growth bottlenecks, rising competition, and investors starting to scrutinize AI budgets more closely, the pressure is on. For now, Amazon remains one of the biggest players in the AI race‚Äîbut unless it can solve its supply issues, it might not be the fastest.

# Honeywell to Break Up After Pressure From Activist Elliott

Being a sprawling industrial conglomerate isn‚Äôt as cool as it used to be. Honeywell is officially breaking itself up into three independent companies: aerospace, automation, and advanced materials. The decision comes after activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $5 billion stake last year and called for a split, arguing that Honeywell‚Äôs complex structure was holding back its stock price. Investors initially cheered the move, but reality hit fast‚Äîshares fell 6% after Honeywell‚Äôs 2025 forecast came in weaker than expected.

**What‚Äôs Staying and What‚Äôs Going**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs aerospace division, which supplies aircraft parts and systems, will become one of the largest public aerospace companies post-split. It brought in $15 billion in revenue last year and will finally get to stand alone. The automation unit, which sells warehouse robotics and smart energy systems, is the company‚Äôs largest segment with $18 billion in revenue. The smallest of the three, advanced materials, had $4 billion in sales and was already in the process of being spun off before Elliott pushed for a broader split. The breakup is expected to be completed by the second half of 2026.

**The End of the Conglomerate Era**  
  
Honeywell‚Äôs move is part of a broader trend‚Äîbig industrial giants are ditching the all-in-one business model. General Electric pulled off a similar split, spinning off its energy and healthcare units and unlocking more than four times its pre-breakup value. Investors have been pushing for leaner, more specialized companies, and Honeywell is just the latest to cave to that pressure. A breakup could boost Honeywell‚Äôs enterprise value by as much as $32 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, though history shows that not all spin-offs are immediate winners.

**What‚Äôs Next?**¬†While Elliott is celebrating, the real test is whether these three new companies can deliver better returns than Honeywell did as a single entity. CEO Vimal Kapur acknowledged that aerospace, in particular, has been ""diverging more and more"" from the rest of the business, making the split logical. But with a softer-than-expected outlook for 2025 and concerns about entering ‚Äúdeal purgatory‚Äù until the split is finalized, investors might need patience before seeing the full payoff.

1ij4254_INTC,INTC,Honeywell to Break Into 3 as It Seeks GE Magic. The Stock Is Dropping After Earnings Beat.,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/honeywell-earnings-stock-price-breakup-ge-c0698336](https://www.barrons.com/articles/honeywell-earnings-stock-price-breakup-ge-c0698336)

    Honeywell International is trying to pull a GE, breaking up into three companies to try to unlock shareholder value.
    
    Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, also reported fourth-quarter numbers on Thursday. The earnings were solid. Guidance, however, was below Wall Street estimates.
    
    Investors undoubtedly will pay attention to the 2025 outlook, but more importantly the portfolio actions the company announced.
    
    Honeywell laid out plans to break apart into three companies: One dedicated to automation, one to aerospace, and another to advanced materials.
    
    Automation is the largest business, with about $18 billion in annual sales. Aerospace revenues is in the range of $15 billion. Advanced Materials is the smallest business, with about $4 billion in annual sales.
    
    The breakup idea appears to be inspired by activist fund Elliott Investment Management, which suggested the idea in November. Elliott might have drawn inspiration from General Electric. CEO Larry Culp‚Äôs plan to split GE into three companies: GE Aerospace 
    GE, GE Vernova,and GE HealthCare Technologies, arguably created hundreds of billions in shareholder value.
    
    One way breakups generate value is simply by valuation multiple arbitrage. Honeywell stock trades for about 21.5 times 2025 EPS guidance. Many more focused peers trade for higher multiples. GE Aerospace stock trades for about 38 times. Rockwell Automation, another automation player, trades for about 28 times.
    
    DuPont, another advanced materials company, trades for about 18 times. Its low multiple is one reason it plans to spin off its electronics business in late 2025.
    
    ‚ÄúThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies,‚Äù said Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur in a press release. ‚ÄúWe will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value. We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business.‚Äù
    
    The second part of his statement shows that Kapur is aware of ‚Äúdeal limbo‚Äù risk‚Äîthe risk that Honeywell stock gets stuck while investors wait for the spins to approach.
    
    The advanced materials spin is slated to wrap up in late 2025 or early 2026. The separation of the remaining automation and aerospace business should be done by the second half of 2026.
    
    It‚Äôs a big undertaking. Kapur is betting it will be best for investors in the long run.
    
    Meanwhile, for the fourth quarter, Honeywell announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.47 from sales of $10.1 billion. Wall Street was looking for per-share earnings of $2.32 and sales of $9.8 billion, according to FactSet.
    
    
    Management expects 2025 earnings to land between $10.10 and $10.50 a share. The midpoint of $10.30 is below analysts‚Äô current projection of $10.92. The midpoint of sales guidance is $40.1 billion, below analysts‚Äô current projection of $41.3 billion.
    
    The guidance looked light. That might divert some of the attention away from Honeywell‚Äôs transformation plan.",2025-02-06,58,13

## üöÄ Boeing Starliner completes first orbital flight test with successful landing
The Boeing CST-100 Starliner‚Äôs first mission ended historically today when it became the first American orbital space capsule to land on American soil rather than in an ocean. Shortly after its launch and separation from its booster rocket, Starliner experienced a mission timing anomaly that made it use too much fuel to reach the intended destination of the International Space Station. Flight controllers were able to address the issue and put Starliner into a lower, stable orbit. The vehicle demonstrated key systems and capabilities before being signaled to return to Earth.
