>International Business Machines (IBM) today outlined two key strategic initiatives: a substantial multi-year investment commitment within the United States and the introduction of advanced AI capabilities for cybersecurity operations. These moves signal a reinforcement of IBM’s core technology manufacturing base alongside a targeted push into higher-value, AI-driven security solutions.

>The primary financial commitment involves a planned $150 billion investment in the US over five years, as detailed in an IBM press release issued today. Notably, this includes over $30 billion allocated to R&D and continued domestic manufacturing for mainframes and quantum computers. IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna stated in the release that the investment aims to ensure IBM remains central to advanced computing and AI, noting, “Technology doesn’t just build the future – it defines it.” This investment supports existing infrastructure, such as the Poughkeepsie mainframe facility—which IBM notes processes over 70% of global transaction value—and furthers development in quantum computing, where IBM operates a significant fleet and targets complex problem-solving beyond classical computation.

In addition to this IBM also announced new agentic AI and automation features for its ""ATOM"" (autonomous threat operations machine) agent. ",2025-04-28,54,24

But IBM was able to satisfy investors AND, more importantly, is said part of its success was AI. Given the short memory I attribute to investors, I think that they will be happy to revert their hedges today, or at least pause it until Microsoft's report next week. Unlike Alphabet, Code Pilot is a very popular tool, so I expect Microsoft to please investors and give them lollipops and confidence in AI as a money printer.

This assumes that the latest so-called correction is indeed a hedge and not a rotation and that Microsoft is going to deliver. And, of course, I hope that no weird political events will bless us in the following week.",2024-07-25,0,26

1cc8y2r_IBM,IBM,"IBM to acquire HashiCorp in $6.4 billion deal, reports another revenue miss","IBM shares slipped as much as 6% in extended trading on Wednesday after the hardware, software and consulting provider said it would acquire cloud software maker HashiCorp and reported first-quarter revenue that was lower than analysts had predicted.

In a statement, IBM announced that it intends to pay $35 per share in cash for HashiCorp in a deal with a $6.4 billion enterprise value, net of cash. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM was getting close to acquiring HashiCorp, sending shares upward. Bloomberg said earlier on Wednesday that IBM was looking to offer $35 per share.

The deal would be accretive to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first full year after close, and accretive to free cash flow in the second year after close. IBM said it expects the transaction to close by the end of 2024. Dave McJannet, HashiCorp’s CEO, will report to Rob Thomas, IBM’s senior vice president in charge of software, if the deal goes through, a spokesperson said.

HashiCorp would complement Red Hat, which has contributed to IBM’s revenue growth since the $34 billion acquisition in 2019. IBM now sells Red Hat’s version of the Linux operating system for use on multiple public clouds, making it a neutral entity. HashiCorp pioneered open-source software that developers rely on to control cloud infrastructure. Premium versions of the Terraform cloud-management software and other products have brought revenue to HashiCorp.

In 2021 HashiCorp shares started trading on the Nasdaq. But revenue growth has slowed, and the company has continued to report losses. Still, it’s adding revenue at a faster pace than IBM.

HashiCorp shares moved 4% higher in extended trading following the acquisition announcement.

Here’s how IBM did in comparison with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.68 adjusted vs. $1.60 expected

Revenue: $14.46 billion vs. $14.55 billion expected

IBM’s revenue increased around 1.5% year-over-year during the quarter, according to a statement. This marks the company’s third revenue miss in the last five quarters.

Revenue from software, at $5.90 billion, increased about 6% and was below the $5.96 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

IBM’s consulting revenue came in at $5.19 billion, down slightly and just under the $5.20 billion StreetAccount consensus.

Infrastructure revenue totaled $3.08 billion. It declined 0.7% but came in higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $2.94 billion.

During the quarter, IBM said it was providing its 160,000 consultants with artificial intelligence assistants to boost productivity, and the company completed the divestiture of The Weather Company to Francisco Partners.

Notwithstanding the after-hours move, IBM shares are up about 13% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which is up 6% over the same period.

17g569c_META,META,"Expected Moves: Meta, IBM, Servicenow and more.","The indices are getting pulled in a couple different directions this morning due to some big-cap stocks going in different directions on earnings. Microsoft and Boeing are both higher, both slightly inside the expected move at this point. Alphabet is lower and by slightly more than what options were pricing. That mix has the DJIA going one way and the QQQ's going the other. And the SPY/SPX is saying ""Waddya want from me?"" (bonus points if you got that).

This afternoon we have Meta earnings. Currently, META options are pricing an almost 7.5% move. That's more than the +4.5% the stock moved last earnings but oh boy, the ones before that? +14%, +23%, and -25%. Massive moves for a company of that size/market cap. 

The stock itself has been volatile over the past few months but finds itself in essentially the same place it was in early August. The stock is down about 4% from its mid-Summer highs and up about 10% from its mid-August lows.

One particular thing of note, the weekly options (expiring Friday) are 135 IV or so. The 30day IV is 50. That's a pretty big difference and it results in an expected move chart that is much straighter/flatter than normal meaning a breakeven 30-45 days on a spread trade may only be a small difference in the stock. Here's an example. A call spread expiring this week, targeting the expected move to the upside. It is 25 wide and maxes out at 337.50 to the upside. Its breakeven is 322.60 in the stock:

https://preview.redd.it/y1alrkrtqcwb1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6f86b1f1c49dd164f06caa468c5e878e3f42cb

Compare that to a call spread targeting a level $10 higher in the stock on Dec 1st expiry:

The breakeven is less than $4 higher (about 1.2% in the stock), has more room to run to the upside, and an additional 35 days or so to do it. This is just a bullish example, the same would be true looking to the downside. This set-up is very similar to Netflix last week, where the earnings expiry was nearly 3x 30-day IV. As a comparison, MSFT and GOOGL yesterday were 2x. This is just one thing to look out for when choosing expiry, those IV differences can be informative, and one way to compare is via expected move levels and trade breakevens.

Yeah, I'm talking about that old-as-dirt tech behemoth your  grandma's boyfriend probably worships. The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**

**If  you haven’t been paying attention, IBM’s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with “disrupters” like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM’s MAIN FOCUS!**

**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy’s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend’s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**

**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin’s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**

**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**

**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**

**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend’s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**",2023-05-25,7,26
1352ac9_IBM,IBM,IBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could Do,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-back-office-jobs-that-ai-could-kill?leadSource=reddit\_wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-back-office-jobs-that-ai-could-kill?leadSource=reddit_wall)

 [International Business Machines Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBM:US) Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said the company expects to pause hiring for roles it thinks could be replaced with artificial intelligence in the coming years.

Hiring in back-office functions — such as human resources — will be suspended or slowed, Krishna said in an interview. These non-customer-facing roles amount to roughly 26,000 workers, Krishna said. “I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period.”

That would mean roughly 7,800 jobs lost. Part of any reduction would include not replacing roles vacated by attrition, an IBM spokesperson said.

As artificial intelligence tools have captured the public imagination for their ability to automate customer service, write text and generate code, many observers have worried about their potential to [disrupt the labor market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-30/tech-ai-driving-job-changes-for-nearly-a-quarter-of-all-workers). Krishna’s plan marks one of the largest workforce strategies announced in response to the rapidly advancing technology.

More mundane tasks such as providing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments will likely be fully automated, Krishna said. Some HR functions, such as evaluating workforce composition and productivity, probably won’t be replaced over the next decade, he added. 

IBM currently employs about 260,000 workers and continues to hire for software development and customer-facing roles. Finding talent is easier today than a year ago, Krishna said. The company announced [job cuts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/ibm-to-cut-about-3-900-workers-still-hiring-in-higher-growth-areas) earlier this year, which may amount to about 5,000 workers once completed. Still, Krishna said IBM has added to its workforce overall, bringing on about 7,000 people in the first quarter.

Krishna, who has been CEO since 2020, has worked to focus the century-old company around software and services such as hybrid cloud. He has divested lower-growth businesses like managed infrastructure unit [Kyndryl Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KD:US) and part of the Watson Health business.

I followed Buffett into this play, and while for years I was unhappy holding it, basically just collecting the dividend (which is not all too bad), it finally looks to be paying off. PE is at just above 22, so not amazing, but clearly the market is seeing value in their cash flow and turnaround. 10B of cash puts them in a decent position to acquire some more tech companies, many of which are looking very attractive these days.

v49afp_IBM,IBM,"Why would IBM sell shares of its spin-off company, Kyndryll?","IBM announced that its going to completely offload shares of its spin-off company, Kyndryll. Seems like bad timing after the price of the spin-off has already dropped significantly due to market conditions. 

Isn’t this a really inefficient way to sell growth assets? It seems weird to go through all the trouble of a spin-off only to sell your entire holding. Can someone explain the reasoning? Thanks

The Barron’s article is as follows: 
IBM has swapped half of its nearly 20% stake in the managed IT services firm Kyndryl to Goldman Sachs, securities filings show. 

As part of the IBM (ticker: IBM) spinoff of Kyndryl (KD) completed last November, Big Blue held on to a 19.9% stake, but promised to sell it within 12 months of the completion of the spin. 

Kyndryl shares have struggled mightily in the public market -- the stock has fallen by more than 50% since closing the first day of trading at $26.38. 

There are several reasons for the weak performance, which go beyond the broad selloff in tech shares. Kyndryl is working to turn around its business, but expects shrinking revenue until fiscal year 2025. 

Also, while investors like IBM shares in part for its 4.7% dividend yield, Kyndryl isn't paying any dividend, which made it either impossible or unattractive for some IBM holders to keep their Kyndryl stake. 

Kyndryl also has faced the overhang from the pending sale of IBM's stake. But the unwinding of that position is now making some progress. 

In a recent filing with the SEC, IBM disclosed that it has swapped half of its stake, about 22.3 million shares, along with $46 million in cash, to Goldman Sachs, in exchange for the extinguishment of a $357 million short-term credit facility. Goldman, in turn, filed with the SEC to disclose the position, and has since sold a small portion of the shares. 

""Consistent with our stated intentions at the time of the separation of Kyndryl, IBM has begun to sell its retained stake in Kyndryl,"" IBM confirmed in a statement. ""This initial transaction addresses half of our holdings. It remains IBM's intention to sell its remaining stake within 12 months of the November 3, 2021 Kyndryl separation date."" 

It could take some time for the market to completely absorb the shares held by IBM, and now Goldman. Together, they total close to 45 million shares, or more than 20 days of average trading volume in Kyndryl shares",2022-06-03,0,4

Here's my take on IBM, and why I think it needs way more love and attention. I'll try and post my positions in the comments as it doesn't wanna let me do it here...

Hey, so I've been riding the wave after GME trying to find a few places to store cash that could help diversify my portfolio and help to keep my gains from riding that rocket. One of those is IBM. Theres an insane amount of reasons I've decided to go with this company, and at first it was as a nest egg option to help grow my account at a consistent rate (dividends are @ 4.56% right now). It also has HUGE upside potential, it is in basically the same industry as Microsoft but only has a market cap of 117 billion vs Microsofts HUGE 2.3T. Doing the math there is goddamn simple and if you were in the market for mad gains why would you not look at this as a huge growth investment.

Now there has been a huge crash on IBM, take it from me this is a sale. Big Blue missed their quarterly revenue by .06 billion, but they met their expected eps. Some short seller went on tv a couple days ago before their report and basically bashed them saying they were a prime short selling target [Jim Chanos, betting against IBM, accuses firm of 'financial engineering' (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/short-seller-jim-chanos-reveals-bet-against-ibm-ahead-of-earnings-this-week.html) .

The reason this crash is so enticing is because of a spinoff company named Kyndryl. IBM will be splitting off its managed infrastructure services portion and making it into a tradable company. sometime in November. WHICH BY THE WAY IS ALSO FREE MONEY (sort of, not sure yet how it will correct IBM), for every 5 shares of IBM you get 1 share of Kyndryl. Besides the free Kyndryl stock, IBM is now free to pave the way with a lighter and more streamlined company, and their focus is basically the same mark et as microsoft. I do want to heed caution, please look at their stats before just diving right into the stock. It isn't some high profit margin machine, the idea is that it will develop into one though with the shedding of some weight via Kyndryl.",2021-10-22,0,47

n6x0fa_IBM,IBM,IBM has revealed a new chip technology that promises massive improvements in both power and energy efficiency.,"Thoughts on IBM and this technology? It seems like this could be a dominant technology in semiconductors in a few years.

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

Source excerpt: IBM Unlocking a $1 trillion market: According to Spangenberg, only 2-5% of patents translate into $180 billion of value in the market. However, traditional patents are “notoriously difficult to manage, value, and transact to be treated as a liquid asset.” In this light, NFTs represent an opportunity to make the sector much more transparent and cost-efficient, unlocking a $1 trillion—or more—market.

“The use of NFTs to represent patents will help create completely new ways to interact with IP \[intellectual property\]. This is expected to benefit not only large enterprises that have significant intellectual property, but it will bring new opportunities to small and medium enterprises and even individual IP owners,” Spangenberg explained.

As stated by the CEO of SMKG, Massimo Barone, “This is a remarkable precedent to see confirmed that the market size potential to capitalize on as we move forward. Until now, the Patent market size was immeasurable or valuation target not clearly distinguishable, but thanks to Enterprise companies like IBM setting the Token Patent market size at $1Trillion plus. At SMKG, we are now able to quantify our investments into developing and IP strategy for our targets and showcase to investors and stakeholders our internal expert opinions on the true valuation of our proprietary portfolio of 16 Fintech and PayTech applications. This benchmark by IBM allows us to showcase that 3 of our blockchain and tokenizing solutions have a potential market target opportunity in a 1 Trillion USD market. We were already excited in working in collaboration with several partners on tokenizing patents and registered formulas with our two platforms, and preparing the offering potential on listed crypto exchanges. We know with this current market validation by IBM to publicly disclose a market value potential to global markets set us way ahead of the market with future ready solutions to accelerate our offerings with clients.

“At SMKG, we thrive on demonstrating facts and statistics to develop valuation models to benchmark the potential market size opportunities for each of our 16 marketplace technologies. It happens in many cases where we develop a technology with little discoverable valuation for market size and growth which makes it difficult for investors or stakeholders to truly comprehend what we are establishing as we build the IP future of SMKG in Fintech, Retail and Workforce management by enabling payments and blockchain tokenization.""

IBM has been doing that for the past 1-2 years.  I see no reason why that is going to stop.  They keep on missing revenue estimates, their revenues have been declining year-over-year for the past several years.

IBM has appreciated mightily over the past 1-2 months, I think in part due to the nice yield and a good place to park your money while investors rotate out of tech.  Which to me makes for a good shorting opportunity.

Earnings are  4/19.  Anybody going to short IBM?  I'm thinking of either buying a 4/30 130.00 Put for about 1.8, or selling a 4/30 135/140 call spread for about 1.8.

ksf3l2_IBM,IBM,IBM is the new AMD,"I've been sitting around jerking it to my crypto gains while the the equities market is busy trying to decide if we're each getting checks for 100 GME shares or if we're about to have the world's largest civil war re-enactment.

In my zen-like state of post-nut clarity, I figured I'd share a little DD I've been cooking up. About 6 years ago, I saw a little noticed the after the-bell earnings report for AMD. Back then AMD wasn't the OG millionaire printer they are today. They were a has-been boomer stock, that went up against Intel, lost big time, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. For almost a decade AMD was mismanaged, producing 2nd rate video cards and 3rd rate processors. They spent all their money and talent designing low margin chips for OEMs and one off projects (gaming consoles mostly) and spun off their manufacturing arm in a frenzied bid to stay afloat. But after this earnings report AMD jumped like 30%, from jack-shit to 30% higher than jack-shit. The reason for that is of course, Su Bae and her brilliant operational excellence. Anyone who took note of AMD back then is now rich as shit as the stock has climbed 30x since that little earnings report.
I could give you a history lesson about AMD, but this DD isn't about AMD. That ship has sailed and at best you're looking at a 2-3 bagger, complete with a massive implied vol on the options which would completely drown your gains.

No, this story goes back farther than AMD. Before Lisa Su was queen of the CPU racket, she spent a decade at a little company called IBM. The ones who made the Thinkpads your dad was using while getting a BJ from his secretary under his desk, real 90s shit. This was a boomer stock before there were boomer stocks.
So why the fuck am I doing a DD about IBM? Because this is the year it all turns around for IBM.

I could go on about IBM trades at a 14.5 times P/E and has a 5% dividend yield, but that's the opposite of what you want to hear. Don't worry, they keep making less money each year, so that sweet boomer dividend will be gone before you know it.

IBM is spinning off their legacy business that makes all the money, but is making less of it each year, and their Redhat/AI/Cloud business into two separate companies. Now if the market weren't full of Chads who only want to see y/y earnings growth %, having a free second cash cow business that paid the dividend while your AI and Cloud business grew would be seen as a good thing. So if you have IBM when they complete the split, and you can ditch the dividend shares if you want.

Now some 🌈🐻 think IBM can't turn around because their legacy business is declining. But IBM is now on the path towards competing with Microsoft and Amazon. They bought Redhat, which every tech company uses. They have analytics, they have quantum computing, they have ai/machine learning, they have blockchain, and they're making ""hybrid-cloud"", which is just part cloud, part onsite, which governments and companies with sensitive information will love. Something Microsoft and Amazon don't do. Now don't get me wrong, IBM has been saying they were going to do all this for years, but last spring they finally put in a CEO who can steer the ship in the wrong direction.

Arvind Krishna, remember the name. The man has a PhD in electrical engineering and has been living and breathing cloud more than your baja hoodie wearing college roommate after a bong rip.

AMD grew quickly when they got the right CEO because they had all the infrastructure in place to be a big company. IBM is where AMD was 6 years ago except they're ready to transform back into a VERY big company.

All IBM needs to do is cut the stupid dividend, and start using that sweet cash flow to buy up other tech companies. They need search, so companies like ESTC are big potential acquisition targets, and they need edge networking, so they could easily acquire a company like NET or FSLY. Once the market realizes what IBM is in the process of becoming, they're going 🚀🚀🚀.

jxgiee_IBM,IBM,IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going. ",2020-11-20,51,33

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on.

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

j7yzpc_IBM,IBM,"IBM to move on from IT Infrastructure in spin-off deal, focus on cloud growth"," **What is Happening?**

IBM is spinning off its legacy business of IT Management in order to attempt to return $IBM to its blue-chip glory. IBM will now look to take advantage of the[ $1T hybrid-cloud market](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&id=26c150e11d&e=0a139504b4) and its $34B acquisition of Red Hat in 2018. 

**Why does this Matter?**

This is a major shift for a company that has long been considered an American household name. The spinoff is expected to contain more than 50% of the current business, however, IBM is now positioned to be considered more of a software company than a services vendor moving forward. The operational costs of the spinoff are estimated to be in the $5B range.  
 

*“We divested networking back in the ‘90s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn’t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition”*  
*IBM CEO Arvind Krishna*

The two separate firms will be paying a joint dividend in line with the expected dividend for the fourth quarter. From there, it is expected that IBM continues to look for future acquisition opportunities as they make an aggressive push for revenue growth. 

**The Takeaway from Taylor Hoffman Capital Management:**  
Krishna's first big move as CEO tees up the firm to pursue becoming a growth powerhouse. Many analysts like the move for IBM as the traditional IT Management unit has been considered a low growth laggard that has hurt the stock against larger cloud competitors.",2020-10-09,86,27

gbjltk_IBM,IBM,"People who are looking for ""cheap"" stocks might consider IBM. They trade at 12x earnings, pay a ~5% dividend, and just acquired redhat recently","IBM has had basically flat (slight decline) revenues and profits for ~5 years, which is not quite the Tech stock headline we are used to seeing.  Market cap is 108bn today, revenues of 77bn in 2019, and earnings of 9.4bn. 

I feel they are integrated into so many business / government operations, that they will be reasonably well positioned during the covid crisis to continue to make money.  It is true that IBM will not be able to sell as many new services while its clients cost cut & pause new investing. However IBM is a mature business - clients cannot easily switch products - and they will continue to earn from those.  

They are focused improving their hybrid cloud offerings and acquired redhat in July 2019 for 34bn, which at the time had growing earnings (3bn per year most recently), and growing revenues. Maybe IBM will screw up this trend, but hopefully not. Cloud provides some upside potential.

Even though we see some slight declines in earnings/revenues, IBM is still massively profitable, and I believe can eventually regain their footing through investment in R&D or acquisition.  Having a lot of cash coming in is huge, because they can afford to make investments that many smaller contracting companies cannot.

IBM's global technology services (consulting, build, design, run) has been declining (9% YoY), which accounts for 60% of their revenue. However IBM is pretty well diversified in offerings, and will likely see other bets begin to offset this. Cloud is about 30% of their business and is growing at a 20% YoY rate.

IBM pays ~5.7Bn out in dividends of it's 9.7bn in earnings, so dividend is sustainable. I think for the price, IBM is a bargain.  It's not a trendy company, but it makes money and will continue to do so.

So my stock strategy is to seek good dividend stocks that are undervalued and besides one insurance company and medicine supplies I picked IBM reasoning: PE was low, I expected it do do better with RedHat, dividend was good.

78g6vn_IBM,IBM,"Parents giving me IBM stock, I've never owned stock, what should we do?","Finances: My wife and I earn between 120-200k/yr.  No real debt outside our mortgage, owe 400, the house is worth ~530ish.  I fund my 401k and we put money into a Roth as well.  2 children that have college funds underway being funded by grandparents for the most part.  

So my sister is starting a business and instead of my parents giving her cash to start up, they decided to give us both some stock that would have been left to us anyway and let us use it any way we see fit. There are roughly 500 shares of IBM that has been in the family since the 50's, so I'll get 250. 

Here is the hard part, I'm emotionally attached to this stock.  It was my Mom's dads company stock, and it comes with a newspaper article from the late 50's that says ""never sell your IBM stock"" and it's been a family joke, you just don't sell the stock.  I've never owned stock, let alone a juicy dividend, but am I crazy to keep it?  We don't *need* the cash, but I also don't want to ride a dinosaur down and just be left with nothing while waiting for them to reinvent themselves.

TLDR: inheriting 250 shares of IBM, I'm emotionally attached to the stock, sell because IBM is a looser, or hold because this ""reinventing themselves"" thing is about to take off.

-	The future, i.e. strategic imperatives business, now accounts for 45% of revenues and is growing 11% while the older legacy business is fell 8%.  

-	More importantly the strategic initiatives growth (having increased from 7% last quarter) is beginning to accelerate and cloud revenue growing 20%.

-	Guidance was unchanged with adjusted EPS of at least $13.80


The stock price closed SP on Friday at $162.20 mean the company has a ridiculously cheap forward PE of 11.75 and yield of 3.7%.  
With sales and earnings about to start growing again surely the stock is going to head upwards.

""I'm not an investment adviser. I wouldn't ever urge them to do anything based on what we do. If they want to do what Berkshire does, then they should buy Berkshire,"" he said. ""I think they're making a big mistake by piggybacking me or 10 other people whose names appear in the paper. That is not a great strategy; a great strategy is just to buy stocks consistently over a lifetime and not worry too much about whether they go up or down in any given month or year.""
