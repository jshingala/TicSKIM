17s4hjw_ILMN,ILMN,Whats your take on ILMN,,2023-11-10,4,6
17lihto_ILMN,ILMN,Eyes on $ILMN,"Two years ago, ILMN was a $60B enterprise value (EV = mkt cap+debt-cash), up 10x from 2012. Revenues grew 3.5x in that time. Net income this year will be below 2012 despite the revenue growth. Today the EV is $18B. ILMN made many acquisitions of loss-making companies in the gene analysis space over the years. That strategy has come home to roost very hard now. The company clearly failed to manage these acquisitions well as operating costs have soared. '

The good news is that the company still generates free cash flow. The estimate for next year ranges from $550-$750 but that assumes a quite generous revenue growth estimate of 8-12%.

The stock has fallen despite the company beating EPS estimates the last four quarters. If you believe the analysts, ILMN should earn $7.50 a share in 2026, only 2 years away. The company is trading at 14x PE on that number which seems quite reasonable for such an industry leader and largely in line with Thermo Fisher and Agilent.

Thoughts?

**First up,** we've got **First Republic ($FRC)** and it's not looking good. The shares have taken a major hit, dropping **over 50% premarket!** This news came out after the bank announced it had to secure additional funding from **the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase.** This is a tough pill to swallow, but we need to keep an eye on it and see where it goes from here.

Next, we've got **PacWest Bancorp ($PACW)** taking a big hit too, **down 26% premarket.** And it's not just them, other regional lenders like **Western Alliance Bancorp ($WAL) fell 17% as well.** This is all because of investor jitters spreading after Signature Bank was closed by regulators on Sunday.

But it's not just the regional banks taking a hit today. **Bank of America ($BAC) shares fell 5% premarket, and both Citigroup ($C) and JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) also retreated.** This is all because regulators announced emergency measures to ease fears of depositors pulling their money from smaller lenders.

**Now, let's talk about some good news. Illumina ($ILMN) shares rose 3.1% premarket after The Wall Street Journal reported that Carl Icahn was preparing a proxy fight.** This is definitely something to keep an eye on and could lead to some serious gains if things go well.

**So there you have it, folks. It's a mixed bag today, with some stocks taking hits and others on the rise.** Keep your eyes peeled and your ears to the ground, because anything can happen in the world of Wall Street. **Let's get those tendies! 🚀🚀🚀**",2023-03-13,18,8

mgwxlj_ILMN,ILMN,FTC sues Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with Grail,"In an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-of-liquid-biopsy-firm-grail-11617131491

Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won’t go through.

iz6mrw_ILMN,ILMN,ILMN and Grail merger,I think ILMN acquiring Grail sounds like a good merger. What I have the problem with is how it was done. I have seen no discussion about the fact that Grail was started by illumina and was an illumina spin off a bit over a year ago. Illumina used to have a majority stake in Grail and then they divested. Now they want to buy it back for $8b? I think some executives may be positioned for a bonus. I am long ILMN because I like their business mission. But something smells off here.

Im picking some stocks here for the long term and I would like to ask for your insights on the 2 stocks but mainly on NVTA. 

From what I read ILMN has a monopoly on the machines that does the sequencing and it has an early moat on genetics. With that being said, ILMN has already gone above their lows in the coronavirus and seems like its on its way up

So my eyes deviated elsewhere and found NVTA. to my dismay there isn't really much info on them out there other than the occasional beats in earnings and their business being about genetic testing. But I'm sure they have much more going on since, they cant be ARK's 3rd largest holding without being at least a lot more innovative in this segment.

5j1mh3_ILMN,ILMN,2 biotechs to keep an eye on (ILMN and LXRX),"**ILMN**

On Friday the January 20th $135/$165 call spread was bought 5,700 times for $5.05 and the trader also sold the $115 puts 5,700 times for $1.75 (Similar to a bullish risk reversal but with the added leg of the short calls). The 3 way spread was traded for a net debit of $3.30 ($1,881,000). The reason it's an extremely bullish trade is because there is unlimited downside potential below $115.

There has been takeover chatter around ILMN in recent months. The rumor is Roche is interested in them, and apparently they were close to a deal a few months back but couldn't agree on a price (according to sources around the rumors). Then ILMN cut guidance on 11/21 and the stock tanked. Recently though there has been chatter again with Roche interested in revisiting the potential takeover now that it's much cheaper. I'm not saying it will get bought out, but it's one to watch.

**LXRX**

On Friday there was a large roll from the December $15 calls to the January 20th $15 calls. The trader closed the December's for $1.55 and bought the Jan's for $2.60, rolling them out for a net debit of $1.05. That's adding an additional $315,000 into it.

LXRX has phase 3 data for Sotaglifozin due by the end of the year, which will be from their 2nd trial. They reported on 9/9 data from their first trial for Sotaglifozin which met its primary endpoint. The stock jumped over 25% on it, but lost all of its gains over the following couple of months and has rebounded again a bit recently.

The roll out in the options was likely to buy more time for this data, and the fact that they added more into the position shows some pretty bullish conviction in it. ",2016-12-18,81,49
