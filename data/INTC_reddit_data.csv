1kvuqnj_AMZN,AMZN,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

1kspmve_INTC,INTC,"Are insider purchases still a reliable signal in 2025? Recent cases from Intel, PayPal, and Alibaba","For years, I’ve followed a strategy that combines classic fundamental analysis with insider buying activity (from executives and board members), using tools like Dataroma. It has worked reasonably well, but lately I’ve noticed many insiders buying during downturns without a clear recovery, and in several cases they seem to be getting trapped—at least in the short to medium term.

Some recent examples:

Intel (INTC): In April 2025, CEO Pat Gelsinger bought 11,150 shares for around $251,000. However, the stock has remained under pressure due to strong competition in the semiconductor space and acquisition rumors.

PayPal (PYPL): While there haven't been recent insider buys, the company has launched initiatives like “Agentic Commerce” and is showing signs of profitability recovery. Still, the stock hasn’t taken off meaningfully.

Alibaba (BABA): In Q1 2025, major institutions like FMR LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their stakes. However, the stock faces challenges due to regulatory scrutiny, especially after its AI partnership with Apple in China came under fire.

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\- TSMC board member Paul Liu has dismissed rumors regarding TSMC's potential acquisition of INTC's foundries, stating that such discussions have never occurred within the company. Overall caused a small selloff in INTC but nothing major- recently the more major catalyst was the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The market mainly considered this a rumor so interesting to see it still cause a small move. Overall not too interested unless we sell off more. TSM's clear denial of interest in acquiring INTC's foundries shows that they're not really interested in bringing more production to the US or really partnering with a US solution. Overall more of a interesting geopolitical note.

TSMC news came from Digitimes (a daily industry newspaper from Taiwan on the semicondcutor industry)

[**TUR (Turkey ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TUR&p=d)\- The arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to President Erdoğan has led to a significant selloff in the Turkish lira and Turkish assets. We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) **-** California's Public Utilities Commission has granted TSLA a transportation charter-party carrier permit, allowing the company to transport employees in company-owned vehicles, marking a step towards potential public ride-hailing services. The first piece of good news in a while for this stock. Overall I don't think it's good enough to make it have a significant recovery but interested to see if we make any gains today. Watching $235 level. Another step towards self-driving! Risks to watch on this piece of news and blowback are regulatory hurdles, public safety concerns, the overall political risks with TSLA, other self-driving competitors.

So what's got everyone hyped? Seems like a few things happened at once. First off, they got a new CEO - Tan Lip-Bu. The market loves Asian leadership in chip companies (Jensen Huang at Nvidia, Lisa Su at AMD, Morris Chang at TSMC).

There's also this potential foundry deal floating around. TSMC is talking with Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm about maybe taking over Intel's manufacturing division. Intel would keep less than 50% ownership, which makes sense considering they just posted an $18.8B net loss in 2024.

Some folks are also excited about their Xeon 6 system-on-chip. Whatever that is.

The hopium crew will tell you - Intel has DOD contracts. They have parts in almost every major system required for national defense and our military. They have a 0% chance of going bust. Fair point.

Looking at the financial metrics is kinda terrifying though. Revenue growth -2.1% while the industry median is +11.2%. Their EPV is -262.4% of Enterprise Value, which is just... wow.

Honestly, seems like Intel is trying one last Hail Mary with the new CEO and restructuring. If you're already holding, maybe you ride the wave. If you're looking to get in, maybe wait for proof they can actually execute?

1j9j16t_INTC,INTC,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

I've heard that Intel's big chip factory is delayed until like 2030... idk the price is so low it is a tempting buy but I need to hear what others think about it first.

# Understanding NVIDIA’s price drop and the AI picture in Wall Street’s Closed Mind

With massive investments in artificial intelligence, much of Wall Street now sees it as a fad because large corporations are having trouble monetizing AI models.

They think that just because Claude 3.7 Sonnet can’t and will never replace a $200,000/year software engineer, that AI has no value.

This is illustrated with NVIDIA’s stock price.

# The AI Revolution is about empowering small businesses

Thanks to AI, a plethora of new-aged companies have emerged with the fastest revenue growth that we have ever seen. Take [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for example.

In less than 12 months, [they reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.](https://sacra.com/c/cursor/) This is a not a business with 1,000 employees; this is a business with 30.

I’m the same way. Thanks solely due to AI, I could build a fully-feature algorithmic trading and financial research platform in just under 3 years.

Without AI, this would’ve cost me millions. I would’ve had to raise money to hire developers that may not have been able to bring my vision to life.

AI has enabled me, a solo dev, to make my dream come true. And SaaS companies like me and Cursor are not the only beneficiaries.

All small business owners benefit. Even right now, you can cheaply implement AI to:

* Automate customer support
* Find leads that are interested in your business
* Write code faster than ever before possible
* Analyze vast quantities of data that would’ve needed a senior-level data scientist

This isn’t just speculation. Small business owners are incorporating AI at an alarming rate.

But they are wrong and NVIDIA’s earnings prove it. The AI race isn’t slowing down; it’s just getting started. Companies like DeepSeek, which trained their R1 model using significantly less computational resources than OpenAI, demonstrate that AI technology is becoming more efficient and accessible to a wider range of businesses and individuals.

1ivwnjo_INTC,INTC,Investment Competition valuation of Intel,"Hi,

i am new to reddit so i don't know if this is the right place to say this but i will anyway. I am currently in a investment competition in which we need to evaluate a stock and i choose Intel(INTC). I have spend a long time writing porters five forces and all of that other stuff but i am really stumped on this. please give feed back if you think that this is good or bad valuation of the stock and if it makes sense. thank you. Also please tell me if there is a better place to post this question. Here it is

My fair value target price for Intel (INTC) is **$45.32** per share, which represents a **133.25% upside** from its current price of **$19.45**. Here is how I arrived at that target:

1. **Comparative Company Analysis**: I first compared Intel to its peers in the semiconductor and data center sectors. Intel trades faverably relative to its competitors, performing better in terms of revenue growth and market share in both the consumer computing and data center industries. Despite challenges in its manufacturing capabilities, Intel’s strong leadership in process technology and its strategic pivot to AI and cloud computing solutions position it well for long-term growth. Based on this analysis, Intel appears undervalued by 20%, trading at 12x its 2022 EBITDA, compared to 16x for its competitors. My target price based on this is **$42** per share.
2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**: To maek my price more specific , I created a DCF model with projections for the next 10 years. I included three scenarios: bull, base, and bear. In my **bull case**, I assumed Intel would successfully execute its strategy to regain leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, leveraging its substantial R&D investments and strong partnerships. In the **bear case**, I accounted for continued challenges from competitors like AMD and TSMC, as well as potential delays in Intel’s product cycles. My weightings for these scenarios are 40%, 40%, and 20%,. With the base scenario, it increase to the price of 25 dollars a share, and here is how i did it.
   * I calculated Intel’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), factoring in its cost of equity and cost of debt.
   * For my price targets, I used both a 5-year and a 10-year DCF model. My primary forecast is the 10-year DCF, as I believe Intel has significant growth potential once its product pipeline stabilizes. However, I also calculated the 5-year DCF for investors with a more short-term investment focus.
   * For both forecasts, I averaged two methods: the perpetuity growth method and the target terminal multiple method. I used a 14x FCF multiple for the 10-year forecast and an 18x FCF multiple for the 5-year forecast. These multiples are based on current FCF multiples of Intel’s competitors growing at similar rates. I assumed a 3%  growth rate for both projections.

**Final Price Target**: After calculating both DCF models, I derived the following:

* **5-Year DCF**: A fair value of **$43** per share.
* **10-Year DCF**: A fair value of **$47** per share.

1. Based on these models, my final price target for Intel is **$45.32** per share, which is the average of the 10-year DCF price (**$47**) and the comparative company analysis price (**$42**).

# Intel Has Biggest Rally Since 2020 on Breakup Speculation

Intel just pulled off its biggest rally since 2020, with shares spiking 16% on speculation that the struggling chipmaker might get split up. Broadcom is reportedly eyeing Intel’s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC could take over its factories in a deal that would fundamentally reshape the company. The stock is now up 31% this year, but after last year’s 60% slump, investors are left wondering—is this the start of a comeback, or just another false alarm?

**Breaking Up to Stay Relevant?**

Intel has spent the past decade falling behind Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, missing out on the AI chip boom while watching its once-dominant manufacturing division lose ground. A split could finally give Intel the focus it needs, with TSMC running the factories and Broadcom taking over chip development. But there’s a catch—Washington is unlikely to approve foreign control of Intel’s U.S. plants, especially after Intel scored $7.9 billion in CHIPS Act funding to revive American semiconductor production.

**Wall Street’s Betting on Change**

The market loved the idea, but the hurdles are massive. Even if TSMC and Broadcom move forward, regulatory scrutiny from both the U.S. and China could block a deal before it even gets started. Intel has already axed 15% of its workforce, reshuffled leadership, and spun off units like Altera, yet it's still trailing competitors. If these deals fall through, this rally could vanish just as fast as it appeared.

**What’s Next?** Intel’s board is on the hunt for a new CEO, but if a breakup is on the table, whoever takes the job might be overseeing a completely different company. Meanwhile, Broadcom and TSMC haven’t even made formal offers, meaning this is still just speculation. If Intel can’t land a deal or find a clear path forward, this rally could turn into just another blip on its long, slow decline.

# Bill Ackman Wants to Turn Howard Hughes Into His Own Berkshire Hathaway

Bill Ackman is doubling down on his vision to transform Howard Hughes Holdings into a modern-day Berkshire Hathaway, raising his bid to $90 per share for 10 million newly issued shares. If the deal goes through, Pershing Square would own 48% of the company, and Ackman himself would take over as chairman and CEO. The hedge fund billionaire is promising a long-term, value-driven strategy—one modeled after Warren Buffett’s empire—where Howard Hughes would acquire controlling stakes in high-quality private and public companies.

**More Cash, Bigger Plans**

Pershing Square is throwing $900 million into Howard Hughes, up from its previous $85-per-share offer. The deal requires no regulatory approval or shareholder vote, meaning Ackman could take the reins in a matter of weeks. The real estate firm, best known for developing master-planned communities like The Woodlands in Houston and Summerlin in Las Vegas, would remain focused on real estate while also expanding into a broader holding company model. Ackman believes that owning these developments in pro-business markets provides a strong foundation for long-term growth.

**Wall Street Is Skeptical**

Howard Hughes shares jumped 6.8% to $80.60 before Ackman’s announcement, only to fall nearly 5% in after-hours trading. Investors aren’t sold on the deal, partly because the company previously estimated its net asset value at $118 per share—far higher than Ackman’s $90 bid. That puts the board in a tough spot: selling at a discount could frustrate shareholders, but rejecting the offer risks missing out on Pershing Square’s capital and strategic direction.

**What’s Next?** Ackman has spent years circling Howard Hughes—he previously served as chairman for over a decade before stepping down last year. Now, he’s looking to return with full control and a long-term vision. If he pulls it off, Howard Hughes could become a multi-industry holding company, much like Buffett’s Berkshire. But if the board holds out for a better price, Ackman may have to sweeten the deal—or walk away entirely.

# Intel Has Biggest Rally Since 2020 on Breakup Speculation

Intel just pulled off its biggest rally since 2020, with shares spiking 16% on speculation that the struggling chipmaker might get split up. Broadcom is reportedly eyeing Intel’s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC could take over its factories in a deal that would fundamentally reshape the company. The stock is now up 31% this year, but after last year’s 60% slump, investors are left wondering—is this the start of a comeback, or just another false alarm?

**Breaking Up to Stay Relevant?**

Intel has spent the past decade falling behind Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, missing out on the AI chip boom while watching its once-dominant manufacturing division lose ground. A split could finally give Intel the focus it needs, with TSMC running the factories and Broadcom taking over chip development. But there’s a catch—Washington is unlikely to approve foreign control of Intel’s U.S. plants, especially after Intel scored $7.9 billion in CHIPS Act funding to revive American semiconductor production.

**Wall Street’s Betting on Change**

The market loved the idea, but the hurdles are massive. Even if TSMC and Broadcom move forward, regulatory scrutiny from both the U.S. and China could block a deal before it even gets started. Intel has already axed 15% of its workforce, reshuffled leadership, and spun off units like Altera, yet it's still trailing competitors. If these deals fall through, this rally could vanish just as fast as it appeared.

**What’s Next?** Intel’s board is on the hunt for a new CEO, but if a breakup is on the table, whoever takes the job might be overseeing a completely different company. Meanwhile, Broadcom and TSMC haven’t even made formal offers, meaning this is still just speculation. If Intel can’t land a deal or find a clear path forward, this rally could turn into just another blip on its long, slow decline.

# Bill Ackman Wants to Turn Howard Hughes Into His Own Berkshire Hathaway

Bill Ackman is doubling down on his vision to transform Howard Hughes Holdings into a modern-day Berkshire Hathaway, raising his bid to $90 per share for 10 million newly issued shares. If the deal goes through, Pershing Square would own 48% of the company, and Ackman himself would take over as chairman and CEO. The hedge fund billionaire is promising a long-term, value-driven strategy—one modeled after Warren Buffett’s empire—where Howard Hughes would acquire controlling stakes in high-quality private and public companies.

1iqwcg5_INTC,INTC,"TSMC, Broadcom consider possible Intel deals to split chipmaker","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considering deals that could split the troubled U.S. chipmaker into two, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

Intel (INTC), currently valued at $102.19 billion, has tumbled nearly 65% in the last five years. In comparison, TSMC's (TSM) current market capitalization stands at $840.25 billion and Broadcom's (AVGO) at $1.09 trillion.",2025-02-16,80,35

1idspvh_INTC,INTC,Intel will skyrocket after earnings today (AGAIN). Here's why,"Intel reports its earnings today after the bell, and I am certain that the price will pump like last time.

I made a post last quarter predicting Intel would go up after earnings. My reasoning for this play was that the CEO at the time (Pat Gelsinger), was very active on X dropping bible quotes every day. You could just see the desperation in his tweets, and on the day he released the earnings report, God saved Intel, and nana smiled from heaven.

But just because Intel got revived, doesn’t take away the fact that Pastor Pat was a trash CEO. So he resigned (got fired) on December 1st and got replaced by these two:

[David, who has been the CFO of Intel since 2022, and Michelle, who I have no fucking clue where she worked prior to becoming co-CEO](https://preview.redd.it/bunyel1q16ge1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3743dc87784b3e4dccabc00fb6b17691d7f5cc2)

In the past few days I tried using the same sophisticated due diligence model (scrolling their X page), but these two have a whopping combined.... 9 tweets since they became CEOs. They mostly consist of announcements written by their marketing-interns, so not that exciting.

Now look, Michelle seems like a nice lady, but we all know who is really calling the shots at Intel here. Today's earnings report will cover the period from October 1 to December 31. I know, David became CEO on December 2nd, but do you really think Pastor Pat just woke up one day and decided he wanted to step down? No, they had been preparing David for months.

So I did some research, David has been responsible for restructuring the company and shaping a better future so Intel can make a comeback. I would say he has been in charge of Intel for at LEAST 2 months before Pastor Pat resigned.

There is clear research out there suggesting that there's a correlation between the success of your favorite NFL team and your performance in the workplace. What more of a DD do you need when looking at the performance of the Steelers during this period?

Mfs have won 10 out of their first 13 games. I bet David's dopamine levels have never been higher, he’s more energized, more optimistic, more productive, and more motivated, and ALL THAT BIG D ENERGY spread throughout the whole company. David had to get the ball rolling. They WILL perform today.

Expectations are still low. They’re down 15% since last earnings. No one expects them to win, and who doesn’t like to root for the underdog?? Expect green fucking dildo's after the close

1idxsqq_INTC,INTC,Intel's revenue forecast disappoints as investors await new CEO,"Intel's (INTC.O), opens new tab first-quarter revenue forecast on Thursday missed analyst estimates, as the chipmaker grapples with tepid demand for traditional data center chips and declining share in the key personal computer market.

Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell close to 2% in volatile extended trading. Last year, Intel's shares lost about 60%.

As the chipmaker undergoes a historic transition and attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods, it has also struggled to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips - a market led by Nvidia.

In its quarterly report after the bell, Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $12.87 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.

Companies looking to capitalize on generative AI technology have prioritized spending on specialized AI processors that can churn huge amounts of data, crimping demand for the traditional server processors that Intel sells.

The company's outlook ""reflects seasonal weakness magnified by macro uncertainties, further inventory digestion and competitive dynamics,"" interim co-CEO and chief financial officer David Zinsner said in a statement.

Intel last year scrapped a 2024 forecast that it would sell over $500 million worth of its new AI processors, named Gaudi, suggesting they struggled to compete against Nvidia's chips.

On an adjusted, per-share basis, Intel forecast it would break-even for the current quarter. Analysts expect adjusted profit of 9 cents per share.

It is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted last month, leaving two temporary co-CEOs at the helm and shrouding Intel's turnaround strategy in uncertainty.

Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue fell 7% from a year earlier to $14.26 billion, beating estimates of $13.81 billion.

The PC market - Intel's largest by revenue share - saw global shipments rise only modestly last year, underperforming analysts' expectations of a strong rebound after months of declines.

The company has also been losing share in the PC and server CPU market to rival AMD.

TLDR: Grandma died 8 years ago. Left me nothing. So I invested my own money. 

Here's why I like Intel:

* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY
* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.
* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.
* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.
* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD
* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.
* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024
* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.
* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05
* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry
* I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",2025-01-21,4218,858
1i5hbca_INTC,INTC,Can Intel Rebound from Quagmire?,"Intel was THE company in Silicon Valley. 

Now, they have been losing market shares to AMD in CPU markets, and lagging behind NVIDIA in AI chip markets. Just experienced worst financial year in several decades in 2024.

Can they turnaround?

Seems like new Co-CEO picks are decent. Both of them are industry/Intel veterans, so they should know the business very well. 

Not so fan about them being non-Technical people. Both of them are finance/marketing experts, not engineer or science types.

Spinning off foundry business is good move.

Investing to upgrade their old manufacturing site is the must. Question is how fast they can capture the gap. Is $100 B enough?

Can they restore their engineer/technical division pipeline back again? Once they were top engineering company. Can they revive that aura?

Sad story short, given when it was high but can only use it now when it's low - so I'm wondering if and what to do with said money 


First of all, I'm trying to understand how the tax works, if I start trading - do I pay tax on every sell? Or will I pay only on this first sell since it's ""free money"" and after reinvesting I'll be taxed for the gains amount? 


Secondary, how and where is It reccomended to start? I can dedicate a some hours a week for it, but not sure where to begin 


Lastly, should I start from a test amount (let's say 1k$) and then invest more and more? Or should I reinvest the entirety of it right away?

1i3jek2_TSLA,TSLA,Intel Shares Jump on Report It’s an Acquisition Target,"Intel Corp. shares jumped as much as 9.5% Friday morning after a report on a technology news site said the beleaguered chipmaker is an acquisition target.

SemiAccurate, a tech-focused newsletter founded by Charlie Demerjian, said it was “read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole” and that the “mystery company has the resources to pull it off.” The report did not name the firm potentially interested in buying Intel.

Once the world’s dominant chipmaker, Intel has struggled in recent years to keep up in a competitive and fast-changing industry. Last month, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the iconic company. Its stock fell 60% last year, and the shares are only now back at their level from early December. Its market valuation is about $90 billion.

Buyers have circled Intel even before Gelsinger’s ouster and takeover speculation has accelerated since then. Qualcomm Inc. approached Intel to discuss a potential acquisition before eventually cooling on the idea, Bloomberg reported last year. Arm Holdings Plc similarly inquired about possibly buying Intel’s product division, but was told the business wasn’t for sale, Bloomberg reported in September.

Intel couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

# Meta to Cut Roughly 5% of Staff, Targeting Lowest Performers

In a move that feels like déjà vu, Meta announced it’s cutting about 5% of its workforce—or around 3,600 jobs—by February. But this round of cuts isn’t about reducing costs—it’s about raising the performance bar. In a memo to employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to “move out low performers faster” and focus on assembling the best talent as Meta gears up for an “intense year” of building in AI, smart glasses, and the future of social media.

**A Balancing Act**

While some roles are being slashed, new ones are being created. Meta plans to backfill these positions later this year, signaling that the company is doubling down on key growth areas. However, Wall Street didn’t exactly cheer—shares fell more than 2% after the announcement.

The memo also comes on the heels of other major changes, including the end of Meta’s fact-checking program and a rollback of diversity efforts, moves that some see as attempts to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration.

**Raising Eyebrows**

Zuckerberg’s efficiency push has sparked internal debate, with some employees questioning whether these cuts disproportionately affect underrepresented groups—especially after recent comments about fostering more ""masculine energy"" in corporate culture. And while Meta says the focus is on boosting performance, critics argue the policy shifts could further erode trust among its workforce, particularly in areas tied to inclusion and oversight.

**The Bigger Picture**

Zuckerberg’s focus on efficiency isn’t new—he dubbed 2023 as Meta’s ""year of efficiency"" and cut over 20,000 roles across the company. Now, he’s positioning Meta to stay competitive as it pivots toward AI-led growth. But this time, the cuts have reignited concerns about whether Meta can pull off this balancing act without losing its edge—or its people.

# Intel to Turn Venture Arm Into Separate Firm With New Name

Intel is spinning off its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, into an independent investment fund, aiming to inject new energy (and new money) into its operations. Intel, which will stay on as an anchor investor, says the standalone fund will start operating under a new name in the second half of 2025, boasting over $5 billion in assets under management.

The move is all about flexibility. By stepping out of Intel’s shadow, Intel Capital can raise funds from external backers while continuing to make strategic bets on innovative startups. The current Intel Capital team will transition to the new entity, and day-to-day operations will carry on without interruption. Interim co-CEO David Zinsner called the split a ""win-win"" that unlocks new capital while keeping Intel’s strategic partnership intact.

**A Legacy of Bold Bets**

Intel Capital, established in 1991, was a pioneer in corporate venture capital. Over the years, it has invested more than $20 billion in over 1,800 companies, with a portfolio spanning AI, cloud, 5G, and robotics. Its big-name bets include AI chipmaker SambaNova and robotics firm Figure, proving that it knows how to pick winners in the tech game.

But this spinoff isn’t happening in a vacuum. Intel has faced significant headwinds, reporting a record $16.6 billion quarterly loss last year—the largest in its history. To turn things around, the company launched a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that included shedding 15,000 jobs and spinning off other divisions like its FPGA business, Altera.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Intel Capital’s newfound independence mirrors similar moves in Silicon Valley (think SAP’s Sapphire Ventures), it underscores Intel’s broader effort to regain its footing amid fierce competition. As Nvidia and AMD dominate the chip scene, Intel’s restructuring is a bet on long-term survival and reinvention.

For Intel Capital, this next chapter presents an opportunity to expand its venture portfolio while navigating the complex landscape of global tech. Meanwhile, Intel’s future depends on whether it can turn its renewed focus on cutting-edge chipmaking into a comeback story worth watching.

I pulled in 13k with Supermicro and Nasdaq, only to use it to improve my average on the Intel call...

So here I am.

What’s your take on Intel?

The new CEO should definitely have an impact on the stock price in the short term. INTC is going up.

Leather Jacket Man has shown us that RTX GPUs are still expensive, but Intel has delivered some solid budget GPUs. INTC is going up.

I’ve heard rumors about a war in Taiwan? INTC is going up.

The CHIPS Act isn’t going anywhere, even under the Trump administration? INTC is going up.

Tariffs. America first. INTC is going up.

Intel is splitting and focusing on foundry orders, potentially benefiting from companies like Nvidia? INTC is going up.

So, is this just bagholding, or do things actually look pretty good for Intel over the next few years?

Even with a new CEO, I think the stock could hit 24 USD in the short term...

What do you guys think?

1hlddfj_INTC,INTC,"Intel shareholders file case asking ex-CEO, CFO to return 3 years of salary","CFO and co-interim CEO David Zinsner, along with the company’s former CEO, misled shareholders about the financial performance of Intel’s foundry unit, shareholders allege.

* Intel Corporation shareholders are asking for [the disgorgement of](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441318/gov.uscourts.cand.441318.1.0.pdf) “all profits, benefits, and other compensation” obtained by ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger, CFO and current co-interim CFO David Zinsner and other company leadership, arguing the leaders breached their fiduciary and contractual duties, according to a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed Tuesday.
* Filed in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California, the suit by shareholder LR Trust on behalf of Intel alleges that both Gelsinger and Zinsner breached their fiduciary duties as officers of the company by issuing misleading disclosures and failing to accurately report financials related to the company’s foundry business. Gelsinger and Zinsner, as well as other named defendants, which include both current and past members of the company’s board, “exposed the Company to significant liability under various federal securities laws by their misconduct,” according to the suit.
* “As a result of the individual defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty and other misconduct, Intel has sustained substantial damages and irreparable injury to its reputation,” the suit says, noting that the officers received “unjust enrichment” stemming from their misconduct.

The suit coincides with efforts by the chipmaker to regain the trust of its shareholders after it failed to execute a turnaround plan spearheaded by Gelsinger. A 40-year veteran of the Santa Clara, California-based company, Gelsinger abruptly [resigned from his position as CEO](https://www.cfodive.com/news/intel-cfo-takes-interim-co-ceo-role-board-ousts-leadership-genAI-layoffs/734506/) and a member of the board effective Dec. 1 after the company reported a record quarterly loss of $16.6 billion for its third quarter, with losses related to the turnaround efforts, CFO Dive previously reported.

The company subsequently appointed Zinsner and Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-interim CEOs, with Zinsner continuing to serve as CFO, as it continues to move forward with its restructuring efforts, targeting $10 billion in cost savings.

The restructuring, which also includes wide-scale layoffs throughout the business, is also widely focused on the company’s foundry business — a key element of the shareholder derivative suit.  

Gelsinger’s turnaround plan included a shift in Intel’s foundry strategy, with the ex-CEO looking to spin off the unit [into its own independent business](https://www.cfodive.com/news/core-business-strategy-intact-ceo-intel-cfo-foundry-chips-semiconductors/734767/) with the goal of allowing Intel foundry to produce chips for its competitors, CFO Dive previously reported.

However, Gelsinger, Zinsner and other company leaders misled shareholders about the financial performance of the foundry unit, the suit alleges. Both officers pointed to the foundry unit as a “significant tailwind” for Intel’s business in various statements and company filings, including during the earnings report for the chipmaker’s full-year 2023 results, according to the suit.

However, in a retrospective revision to the company’s financials filed in April, the chipmaker revealed Intel Foundry to be one of its main cost centers — with [the division losing $7 billion](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000050863/000005086324000068/intc-20240402.htm) in 2023, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The recast sent Intel’s shares spiraling down by 9.2% at the time, according to the suit. The news was also followed by a class action suit alleging shareholders were mislead regarding those [losses related to its Foundry business](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/25/intel_foundry_investor_lawsuit/), according to a report at the time by The Register.

As a result, the chipmaker “has been and will continue to be exposed to significant losses due to the wrongdoing complained of herein, yet the board has not caused the company to take action to recover for the company the damages it has suffered and will continue to suffer thereby,” the December shareholder derivative suit alleges.

As well as Zinsner and Gelsinger, the suit named multiple current and former board members as defendants. Other defendants include Lip-Bu Tan, a former member of the board who abruptly stepped down from his position in August due to concerns [related to Gelsinger’s turnaround plan](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan-2024-08-27/), according to a report at the time by Reuters cited by the suit.

The semiconductor manufacturer has remained focused on its foundry business following its leadership shift. Intel is still seeking to be a “world-class foundry,” Zinsner said during a conference a few days after his appointment to co-interim CEO. As such, it’s also likely Gelsinger’s [permanent successor as CEO](https://www.cfodive.com/news/core-business-strategy-intact-ceo-intel-cfo-foundry-chips-semiconductors/734767/) will have “some capability” around foundry, he said at the time.

Intel declined to comment on the suit. Weiss Law, the attorneys for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Subscribe

Wed, Dec. 18

  
Beleaguered chipmaker Intel has been sued yet again by shareholders over its foundry business, this time in a derivative lawsuit targeting executives and board members.

A [derivative lawsuit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/shareholder_derivative_suit), such as a similar claim filed [in June](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/25/intel_foundry_investor_lawsuit/), is brought by investors on behalf of the company, which receives any damages awarded as a result of the litigation. In a shareholder class action lawsuit, such as the one filed [in August](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/08/intel_legal_trouble_mounts/), the shareholders stand to benefit if they prevail.

The [complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.441318/gov.uscourts.cand.441318.1.0.pdf) \[PDF\], filed in federal court in San Jose, California, accuses two corporate officers – former CEO Pat Gelsinger and interim co-CEO/CFO David Zinsner – and various board members of violating securities law and their fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and wasting corporate assets.

It seeks restitution and punitive damages from the individual defendants that, if awarded, would be paid to Intel, plus court costs for the attorneys representing the plaintiff, LR Trust. For that reason, the legal filing lists the recent compensation of the named defendants, such as the combined total of more than $207 million awarded to Gelsinger in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The derivatives claim focuses on Intel's floundering foundry business. Gelsinger [announced](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-embraces-internal-foundry-model.html) in October 2022 that Intel would pursue ""an internal foundry model,"" a reflection of the company's strategic shift toward making chips both for itself and external customers.

In June 2023, the chip biz said Intel Foundry Services (IFS) would begin reporting its own profits and losses starting in Q1 2024. And on April 2, 2024, the chip maker revealed that IFS had an operating loss of $7 billion on sales of $18.9 billion in 2023.

Then in Q2 2024, the company reported an IFS operating loss of $2.83 billion, substantially worse than the foundry businesses' $1.87 billion operating loss in Q2 2023. The disappointing quarter was [accompanied by layoffs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/01/intel_to_ax_headcount/) and the suspension of Intel's dividend as of Q4. In December, [Gelsinger resigned](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/pat_gelsinger_retires_from_intel/) as CEO.

The complaint points to inadequate risk disclosure in [Intel's 2024 Proxy Statement](https://www.intc.com/news-events/annual-stockholders-meeting) as evidence that executives and board members failed to meet their obligations to shareholders and allowed the company to make false and misleading statements about its financial prospects.

It says, ""\[A\]s later admitted by Intel, and in breach of the individual defendants’ fiduciary duties, the true status of Intel’s affairs at the time were that: (1) IFS’s growth was not indicative of revenue growth reportable under its segment; (2) IFS experienced substantial operating losses in 2023; (3) IFS experienced a decline in product profit driven by lower internal revenue; (4) due to the foregoing, IFS could not be a strong tailwind to Intel’s foundry strategy; and (5) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls.""

Intel, which also faces a lawsuit filed in November [over chip voltage claims](https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/06/intel_sued_over_raptor_lake_chips/), declined to comment. ",2024-12-20,88,36

1h6pcon_MSFT,MSFT,"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

1h6leff_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Intellicheck, Inc. (NasdaqGM:IDN)","IDN is a \~$50mm company securing contracts with some of the world’s largest corporations, all while being surrounded by a moat wider than the Grand Canyon. With 90%+ margins and a clear path for reaccelerated growth, it’s hard to see how this stock won’t exceed expectations. But let me first introduce you to the idea.  
  
Data breaches are surging. The recent United Healthcare breach exposed data on roughly a third of all Americans. For \~$20, this stolen data is available on the dark web, and for just \~$40 more, you can get a visually undetectable by law enforcement fake ID. But who cares about manual checks anymore, right? Surely computers can catch it all.  
  
Wrong. Every competitor relies on OCR templating, a method with detection rates ranging from 65% to 75%. Claims of higher accuracy? Don’t trust them. In contrast, IDN has a \~99.9% detection rate, thanks to its longstanding relationships with the AAMVA and DMVs.  
  
So, why does this opportunity exist? Growth has decelerated, but I've examined the causes and uncovered a relationship that dictates an imminent reversal. Importantly, there is a hard catalyst too. During onboarding, strict NDAs prevent IDN from disclosing the identity of new clients, but sometimes the company gives some clues.  
  
Take 2020, for example. IDN secured a contract with a multinational financial services company that ""provides innovative payment, travel, and expense management solutions for individuals and businesses of all sizes."" A quick copy-paste into Google revealed it was American Express. By April 2021, the stock had quadrupled.  
  
Now, the multinational company IDN signed a contract with is not a card issuer, but ""one of the largest social media platforms in the world."" The setup looks familiar, but will history repeat?

# Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Out

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is stepping down, but not on his own terms. 

The board effectively pushed him out after frustrations over slow progress in regaining Intel’s footing in the semiconductor race. CFO David Zinsner and products leader Michelle Johnston Holthaus will serve as interim co-CEOs while the search for a permanent replacement begins.

Gelsinger’s tenure, which began in 2021, was marked by ambitious goals to revamp Intel’s manufacturing and compete with global leaders like Nvidia and TSMC. But his high-cost turnaround strategy failed to deliver results quickly enough for the board or investors. Shares have plummeted 61% during his tenure, and the company continues to face setbacks in both revenue and innovation.

**Stuck in the Chips Slow Lane**

Intel’s struggles go beyond Gelsinger. The company has long lagged behind in advanced chip production and missed opportunities in the AI boom—an area now dominated by Nvidia. Efforts to expand into foundry services, manufacturing chips for other companies, drained cash reserves without attracting major clients. Meanwhile, competitors gained market share in lucrative AI and data center sectors.

The board’s frustration reportedly came to a head over the lack of compelling products and the slow pace of Intel’s transformation into a contract chip manufacturer. While Gelsinger advocated for staying the course, the board decided it was time for a change, signaling potential strategic pivots ahead.

**A Tall Order for the Next CEO**

Whoever takes the reins will inherit a daunting task. Intel faces mounting challenges: catching up in AI chips, competing with better-funded rivals, and balancing a capital-intensive foundry business with waning investor confidence. The company also has $50 billion in debt, a stark contrast to its cash-rich days of dominating the semiconductor market.

Some analysts suggest Intel may need to spin off its foundry division to focus on core chip design, while others predict deeper cost cuts. Either way, the new CEO will need to act decisively to stabilize the business—and fast. As Intel grapples with its place in a rapidly changing industry, the stakes have never been higher.

# Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated

Elon Musk’s record $56 billion Tesla pay package has hit another roadblock. A Delaware judge upheld her earlier ruling voiding the 2018 compensation plan, despite a recent shareholder vote attempting to reinstate it. Judge Kathaleen McCormick criticized Tesla’s board for its lack of independence in approving the deal, citing undue influence from Musk.

The package, originally worth $2.6 billion and ballooning to $101.5 billion by today’s share prices, was the largest in U.S. corporate history. With the court’s decision, Tesla shareholders have effectively slashed Musk’s prospective payout—though his existing wealth, buoyed by Tesla’s stock rally, keeps him securely at the top of the billionaire leaderboard.

**Shareholders Step In, Court Stands Firm**

Tesla had hoped a June shareholder vote to ratify the pay plan would override McCormick’s concerns, but the judge wasn’t swayed. McCormick called the vote legally ineffective, refusing to accept what she termed “new facts” created to revise prior rulings. Tesla’s board now faces a dilemma: how to keep Musk incentivized without igniting further shareholder backlash or legal trouble.

In addition to voiding the pay plan, McCormick approved $345 million in attorney fees for the plaintiff’s legal team—a fraction of their initial $5.6 billion request but still among the highest awards in U.S. litigation history. Musk’s legal team has 30 days to decide whether to appeal.

**Bigger Battles Ahead**

This setback isn’t likely to slow Musk down. Tesla stock has surged 42% since Donald Trump’s election win, fueled by expectations that Musk’s ties to the incoming administration will yield business-friendly policies. However, with Tesla’s incorporation recently shifted to Texas and the legal dispute unresolved, uncertainty looms.

Musk’s influence over Tesla’s board and shareholder dynamics continues to draw scrutiny, and any new compensation plan will likely face similar challenges. Meanwhile, the billionaire’s ventures in AI, electric vehicles, and space exploration keep him at the forefront of industry and political intrigue—whether or not his paychecks match his ambitions.

# Intel Snags $7.9B Grant to Expand U.S. Chipmaking

The Biden administration has finalized a $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant for Intel, the largest award yet in the push to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The funding will back Intel’s factory projects in Arizona, Oregon, and New Mexico—but Ohio’s delayed plant isn’t in the mix just yet.

This deal is smaller than the $8.5 billion initially floated, partly because $3 billion is now earmarked for military-grade chip production. Intel also turned down $11 billion in loans offered through the program, a move that underscores its cautious financial strategy as it navigates a rough patch.

**Chips Down, but Not Out**

Intel’s struggles are no secret—falling revenue, delays in tech development, and fierce competition from TSMC and Samsung have left the company on shaky ground. CEO Pat Gelsinger has mapped out an aggressive $100 billion U.S. manufacturing expansion to reestablish Intel as a chip leader, but execution has been bumpy.

Ohio’s factory timeline has slipped into the next decade, while production at its Arizona site, originally slated for this year, is now penciled in for 2025. Despite these delays, the company has spent $30 billion so far on its U.S. buildout, banking on the CHIPS Act to sustain momentum.

**Racing Against the Clock**

With Trump’s team criticizing the CHIPS Act as wasteful, the Biden administration is racing to wrap up grant agreements before the presidential handoff in January. Intel’s funding offers a critical boost as the company juggles job cuts, strategic reviews, and an uphill battle to reclaim its tech edge.

The $7.9 billion is more than just a lifeline—it’s a vote of confidence in Intel’s role as America’s chipmaking champion. Whether it can deliver on that promise remains to be seen.

# Walmart Steps Back from DEI Efforts

Walmart is pulling back on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck. 

The company announced it will phase out “DEI” from its corporate vocabulary, reduce racial equity training, and reconsider funding for Pride events. Starbuck had threatened a boycott just before Black Friday unless the retail giant made changes.

**What’s changing:** Walmart will no longer use race and gender as factors in supplier contracts or collect demographic data for financing eligibility. It will also review LGBTQ-themed merchandise, particularly items aimed at children, following complaints. While the retailer says some changes were already in the works, critics see this as a response to Starbuck’s ultimatum.

**A Ripple Through Corporate America**

This isn’t just a Walmart story. The retail giant’s decision reflects a broader trend as companies like Boeing and Deere also scale back diversity efforts. Activists and legal challenges following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling have forced businesses to rethink DEI programs.

For Walmart, the stakes are high. Over half of its U.S. workforce is made up of people of color and women, and it’s invested billions in diverse suppliers. While some argue diversity fosters innovation and talent retention, others see it as a risk in today’s polarized landscape.

**The Big Question**

Will scaling back on DEI hurt Walmart’s workforce and customer base—or solidify its standing with conservative consumers? CEO Doug McMillon, once vocal about racial equity, now faces a tricky balancing act. The retailer plans to fund its Center for Racial Equity through 2025, but its pivot could impact its broader reputation.

For now, the markets approve—Walmart shares ticked up after the announcement was made. But whether this strategy is a retail win or a cultural misstep remains to be seen.

1ggnzbb_INTC,INTC,"Intel shares pop 12% on earnings beat, uplifting guidance","Intel shares jumped 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected revenue and issued quarterly guidance that topped expectations.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted
* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected

Intel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

As part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.

Intel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.

CNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.

The Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Revenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.

Intel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.

As of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.

1g4nr8y_INTC,INTC,Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the matter said.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

The AI Revolution:  
 NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that’s indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation.

Why Intel Could Be the Game-Changer?  
Intel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips.   
Enter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel’s stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down.

Government Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race.

Positive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.

Diamond Hands Ready: This isn't just a strategy; it’s a calculated move anticipating a shift in the tech landscape. Intel could lead the next wave of AI innovation.

1fnco7n_INTC,INTC,Talking about $INTC Takeover Rumors and Apollo Deal,"Let’s talk about the rumors: Qualcomm potentially taking over Intel, and the investment from Apollo. First, the Qualcomm takeover—it’s super unlikely. A takeover is usually either a cash buyout or a merger.

No way Qualcomm goes for a cash buyout. They don’t have that kind of cash lying around, and there’s no chance they’re gonna take on massive debt just to buy Intel. Intel isn’t exactly rolling in profits right now, so taking on that debt would just hurt Qualcomm in the long run with all the interest payments and losses they'd have to deal with from Intel. So yeah, not happening.

A merger seems a bit more possible, but here’s the thing: Qualcomm is already crushing it in AI chips for phones and probably gonna lead the AI PC game too. What do they really get from merging with Intel? The foundry business is the only thing that might attract them, but the price could be steep. Qualcomm would have to deal with Intel’s losses and those from its subsidiaries. Plus, Intel’s board and shareholders wouldn’t agree to a lowball offer. And if Qualcomm offers a premium just for the foundry, I’m not sure their board or shareholders would sign off either.

So yeah, a merger? Not likely. Best case, Qualcomm ends up being a big customer for Intel’s foundry business when they spin it off.

As for the Apollo deal, that seems more legit, but $5 billion isn’t gonna move the needle much for Intel. It might cover one or two quarters of cash burn, but the downside is a likely unsexy valuation and heavy dilution for shareholders. Intel needs the money, so it’ll probably happen, but it’s definitely not great news for shareholders—definitely not the bullish one.

# Microsoft Powers Up AI With a Nuclear Comeback at Three Mile Island

Well, this is one headline we didn’t see coming. Microsoft is so hungry for energy to fuel its AI ambitions, it’s partnering with Constellation Energy to bring back the Three Mile Island nuclear plant — yes, the site of the *worst nuclear accident* in U.S. history. Constellation plans to invest $1.6 billion to reboot the plant’s Unit 1 reactor by 2028, and Microsoft has signed a 20-year deal to buy every watt of power it churns out. Looks like AI isn't just demanding your data — it needs a *whole lot* of juice too.

**What's the Deal?** Constellation, the U.S.'s biggest nuclear operator, plans to turn the once-shuttered Three Mile Island reactor into the Crane Clean Energy Center (a posthumous nod to former Exelon CEO Chris Crane). This marks a major milestone for both companies: Microsoft locks in a reliable, carbon-free energy source to fuel its AI data centers, while Constellation revives an aging reactor that couldn't compete with cheap natural gas and renewables. With AI's skyrocketing power demands, tech giants are scrambling for steady, green electricity.

**A Nuclear Renaissance:** This move taps into a broader trend: nuclear energy's comeback. After a wave of plant closures over the past decade, power-hungry industries like AI and EVs are driving renewed interest in these reactors. Nuclear plants, unlike wind and solar, run 24/7 — perfect for data centers that never sleep. Other tech giants like Amazon and Oracle are also turning to nuclear to keep up with their massive energy needs.

**But It’s Not All Glowing...**  Rebooting a reactor isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. The plant needs major upgrades to its cooling system, turbine, and transformer, and still faces a long queue for grid connection approval from PJM Interconnection, the local grid operator. Plus, it’s got to pass stringent safety checks from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If everything goes smoothly (fingers crossed), Three Mile Island could be back online as soon as 2027.

**Looking Ahead:** AI is reshaping the world — and the energy grid along with it. As data centers keep popping up and consuming ever more electricity, the demand for clean, continuous power will only increase. Whether this sparks a true nuclear revival or just a few isolated reboots remains to be seen, but one thing’s clear: Microsoft is betting on nuclear to fuel its AI-driven future.

Brace yourselves, we might just be entering the **AI-powered nuclear age**.

# Qualcomm Wants to Buy Intel

Things are heating up in Silicon Valley! Qualcomm, best known for its mobile chip domination, is reportedly eyeing Intelfor a possible takeover, according to insiders. If successful, this would not only be one of the largest tech deals ever but could also mark a major shift in the semiconductor industry. Intel, once the top dog, has been *sputtering* with a steep 60% stock drop this year, while Qualcomm is ready to make moves.

**The Plot Thickens:** Intel’s got a lot on its plate – a major $1.6 billion loss this past quarter, layoffs, and restructuring, all while its market value plummeted from $290 billion in 2020 to around $90 billion. Talk about a fall from grace! Despite its struggles, Qualcomm sees a potential golden ticket in Intel's PC and server chip dominance, which could complement its own strength in smartphone chips.

But don’t start popping the champagne yet—this deal is far from certain. There’s always a little thing called antitrust scrutiny that could trip things up. Plus, Qualcomm might have to offload parts of Intel to make it work. Hey, no one said buying a $90 billion company would be easy.

**Why Intel?** For decades, Intel reigned supreme as the largest semiconductor company, but the rise of rivals like AMD, Broadcom, and NVIDIA has left the company in a tough spot. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has been on a three-year turnaround mission, but things haven’t exactly gone according to plan. Their recent efforts include trying to spin off their manufacturing business and landing a deal with Amazon for custom AI semiconductors. Still, Intel is struggling to regain its footing.

On the other side, Qualcomm has been expanding beyond smartphones, recently re-entering the desktop processormarket, especially with AI integration. This could make Intel's x86 chips an ideal addition to Qualcomm's arsenal.

# Looking Ahead

If this deal goes through, it could shake up the global chip game. Qualcomm might finally get the manufacturing muscleit’s been outsourcing, but it’s a risky bet. Intel’s manufacturing issues are notorious, and fixing them is no small task. Plus, the deal would set the stage for a massive showdown between Qualcomm’s ARM chips and Intel’s x86 architecture—a battle that could reshape the industry.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Now that the Fed has wrapped things up, we can focus on what’s coming next week—and it’s packed.

Monday serves up the latest manufacturing and services PMI numbers, Tuesday brings the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, and Wednesday is all about new home sales. On Thursday, it’s jobless claims and pending home sales.

Friday closes out with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s go-to for inflation. While it’s lost a bit of its punch lately as the Fed shifts focus to the labor market, Powell and Co. are still keeping tabs on it.

# Earnings:

Earnings season is cooling off a bit next week, but there are still some big names to watch:

**Tuesday:** Autozone ($AZO), Stitch Fix ($SFIX), KB Home ($KBH)

**Wednesday:** Micron Technology ($MU)

**Thursday:** Accenture PLC ($ACN), CarMax ($KMX), Costco ($COST), Vail Resorts ($MTN), BlackBerry ($BB) ",2024-09-21,1,0

1fb17op_INTC,INTC,Rethink intel stock,"I express concerns about Intel's accounting practices, citing several examples:

Equity increase without issuing stocks: Intel's equity increased by almost 11 billion without issuing new stocks. This increase was partially due to an increase in cash and property plant and equipment, but also due to an increase in debt. I question how this is possible if the company is not profitable.

Joint venture accounting: Intel entered into a joint venture with Apollo, in which Apollo will acquire a segment of the joint venture for 11 billion. Intel will retain the controlling interest and will consolidate the results of the joint venture through its net income. I argue that this transaction should be treated as a liability, not as equity.

1f8spne_AAPL,AAPL,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

* The stock market ended a turbulent August on a high, with investors cheering as fresh inflation data boosted hopes for a September rate cut. The Dow Jones ticked up 0.55%, hitting yet another record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.01% and 1.13%, respectively. The Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose just enough to keep everyone optimistic but not worried.
* While August was anything but calm—starting with growth fears and a mini-selloff—investors came around to the idea that the economy might be landing softly after all. The Dow and S&P 500 chalked up another month of gains, but the Nasdaq couldn’t quite shake off a rough patch for tech stocks. In the end, it’s a mixed bag, but one that leans bullish as we head into September.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",2024-08-31,5,1

The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.

Perhaps getting into data centres and the consumer market.

If they get their act together, this could be their ""Nvidia"" moment where they start pulling up again. Being backed by the US government means that they don't want it to fail.

IPO

Started with 17B valuation: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/mobileye-pops-more-than-30percent-in-ipo-after-spinning-out-of-intel.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/mobileye-pops-more-than-30percent-in-ipo-after-spinning-out-of-intel.html)

Some have speculated that MBLY listing was for the benefit of employees to sell their stock awards if they need cash. Others suggested it was a way for INTC to fund new FAB expansions.

  
MBLY is not INTC though, it is a seperate company, although it seems some people think they are 1 and the same and if INTC isnt doing well ,the same would go for MBLY.

Edit: It appears INTC sold 38.5 million additional shares for $40.84 per share in June 2023, so Grandma is down 65% if she bought some shares at that time, current buyers can get 3 shares for the price of 1 at that time: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mbly/insider-activity",2024-08-14,232,57

“Intel (INTC) was sued on Wednesday by shareholders who said the Silicon Valley chipmaker fraudulently concealed problems that led it to post weak results, slash jobs and suspend its dividend, and caused its market value to sink more than $32 billion in a single day.”

“The proposed class action against Intel, Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger and Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner was filed in San Francisco federal court.”

1en52i2_INTC,INTC,DELL. Another INTC?,"DELL seems to have gotten some of the fiercest devaluation (except for INTC) the last month. Similar to Intel, they're now terminating tons of jobs to clean up their expenses and get leaner looking forward. 

Is this a genuine restructuring and pivot to their AI business or is this a panic measure similar to INTC because they're hemorrhaging funds and need to cut their losses somewhere? 

Where do you stand on DELL? They're getting bloodied right now, but overall they've been doing well and have grown significantly over the last year. Is it all AI hype? 

Personally I think DELL, like all major AI tech stocks will face this correction in the short term and grow significantly in value in the years to come as the AI race actually takes off and consumer AI products become more and more commonplace. I'm not sure who the winner will be in the end, but I can assume DELL branded technologies and software will be present in the corporate working world.",2024-08-08,97,89

I have now realized my mistake, and some people are saying that it will only continue to plummet, but others are saying to hold and don't sell low.

Could someone please lmk what they would do if they were in my situation, and also roast my portfolio while your at it too.

1ek3z4h_INTC,INTC,Intel's stock price is now at the same price it was in 1997,"It’s mind-boggling that Intel’s stock price has somehow circled back to where it was in 1997. We’re talking about a major player in the tech industry, yet its stock has offered virtually no returns for nearly three decades. With such a big name in the semiconductor space, it's surprising to see it move like this. The company just laid off 15% of its workforce, trying to cut costs and restructure. But during a year dominated by AI, Intel seems to have completely missed the boat on capitalizing on this. What’s even more wild is that the U.S. government has pumped billions into the company through subsidies, and yet, we’re still seeing such such underwhelming performance. I’m curious, does anyone out there see this as a buying opportunity, at these levels? The dip might look attractive, but it’s hard to ignore the long-term performance.

❗️The Market Just Flipped the Script

For the last couple of years, we’ve been living in an upside-down world where bad economic news was actually good news for investors. The logic? If the economy looked rough, the Fed might ease up on those pesky interest rates. But now, we’re back in the real world—bad news is just…well, bad.

Let’s talk numbers: The latest employment data is out, and it's not pretty. Unemployment has crept up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Employers added a measly 114,000 jobs in July, a far cry from last year’s monthly average of 251,000. It’s like expecting fireworks and getting a sparkler.

But wait—there's a twist. Some experts are saying that the rise in unemployment is due to temporary layoffs, so this could just be a blip rather than the beginning of a downward spiral. Still, the S&P 500 ($SPY) didn’t take the news lightly, dropping around 2% in what might be the biggest market slump over jobs data in two years.

The Fed’s Tightrope Walk Just Got Trickier

If you’re scratching your head wondering why the market had a meltdown over a job report, here’s the tea: Investors are spooked that the Fed might have overdone it with the rate hikes. The delicate balance between cooling inflation and keeping the economy afloat is starting to look more like a juggling act with one too many balls.

Here’s where it gets juicy: Just yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. But with this latest job data, economists are now betting the Fed might have to slash rates even deeper than anticipated. Think of it as the Fed hitting the brakes a little too late, and now everyone’s bracing for a bumpy ride.

Despite the drama, analysts are urging investors to keep calm and carry on. Volatility might be making a comeback, but that’s par for the course as the Fed gets ready to shift gears.

In short, the market’s mood just did a 180, and we’re all buckled in for whatever comes next.

Earnings Olympics: Winners and Losers

This week’s earnings reports felt like a high-stakes competition, with some companies nailing their routines while others took a tumble. Let’s take a look at who’s bringing home the gold and who’s licking their wounds.

Intel’s Bad Day

Intel ($INTC) had a week so rough, it could use a hug. The chipmaker saw its stock nosedive by 26.06%—its worst single-day performance since the Nixon era—after missing earnings expectations left and right. Revenue fell short at $12.83 billion versus the anticipated $12.98 billion, and EPS was a jaw-dropping 80% lower than expected at just $0.02. To top it off, Intel announced a 15% workforce reduction, meaning 15,000 employees are getting the pink slip.

Apple Bites Back

On the flip side, Apple ($AAPL) kept the doctor away with some solid numbers. The tech giant reported $85.78 billion in revenue, outpacing expectations of $84.38 billion, and EPS hit $1.40, beating the $1.34 forecast. iPhone sales made up nearly half of Apple’s total revenue, but the real MVP was the iPad, with sales skyrocketing 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion.

Amazon’s Mixed Bag

Amazon ($AMZN) gave investors a rollercoaster ride, plunging 8.78% despite a mostly solid report. The company missed on revenue, pulling in $147.98 billion compared to the $148.76 billion expected, but managed to beat EPS estimates with $1.26 versus the anticipated $1.02. While its ad business grew 20%, it still didn’t meet the $13 billion sales target, clocking in at $12.8 billion.

Carvana’s Comeback

Carvana ($CVNA) was the comeback kid of the week, with shares surging after an earnings surprise. The online car dealer reported an EPS of $0.39, smashing the expected loss of -$0.12. Revenue also cruised past expectations at $3.41 billion, up 15% from last year. The cherry on top? Carvana sold 101,000 vehicles this quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year.



Microsoft’s AI Miss

Microsoft ($MSFT) had a mixed day, staying mostly on target but missing the mark on AI. The tech titan reported EPS of $2.95, barely above the expected $2.94, and revenue of $64.73 billion, edging out the $64.44 billion forecast. However, its “intelligence” cloud revenue, which includes its AI efforts, came in at $28.5 billion, just shy of the $28.7 billion target, leaving investors less than thrilled.

In the chaotic world of earnings, one slip can send stocks tumbling, while nailing the numbers keeps you in the winner's circle.



On The Horizon

What’s Coming Next Week:

After a rollercoaster of economic announcements, next week is shaping up to be a much-needed breather. We’ll get a few data points—July ISM services on Monday, June trade balance on Tuesday, and June consumer credit on Wednesday—but nothing that’s likely to shake the market’s foundation.

However, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims report is the one to watch. Given how this week’s job numbers rattled investors, these reports are becoming key indicators for where the market might head next.



Earnings to Watch:

With 70% of the S&P 500 having already spilled the tea on their quarterly earnings, and Big Tech mostly out of the way, you’d think we could relax. But no, there are still some big names reporting next week that you’ll want to keep an eye on:

Monday: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Hims & Hers Health ($HIMS), Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), The Carlyle Group ($CG)

Tuesday: Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

Wednesday: Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

Thursday: Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

Friday: Hawaiian Electric Industries ($HE), Getty Images ($GETY), Canopy Growth ($CGC), Soho House & Co. ($SHCO)

1ej04ru_INTC,INTC,$INTC - A dumb person's retrospective,"I'm lazy and you regards don't like to read so I'll leave it to bullet points and you can piece them together.

1. Intel was seen as a bargain in 2023 compared to NVDA and AMD after their 400% run up.

2. US gov have vested interest in Intel. No they are not propping Intel up, but it's effectively giving Intel a big loan to buy a second house. That loan can pay off if the housing market goes up, or they are double fucked because they leveraged to buy a second house.

3. If you bought Intel because china will invade Taiwan, you are really regarded. If China invades Taiwan, everything is going to sell. That's a disruption of global trade on WW2 levels. Your best case scenario still loses you money.

4. Intel bullish scenario is 18A, High-Na EUV paying dividends, early experience granting them a year technological lead over TSMC. It doesn't have to work, but the upside is a 10x from these levels. TSMC pass up High NA EUV is repeating the same decision Intel did in 2012 when Intel controlled the market and did not view EUV as economically feasible. Again, doesn't mean TSMC is incorrect in their assessment, but history does repeat itself.

5. Intel bearish scenario is just repeat of 2016 and delay after delay. In which case they head to legacy company status like Ford. Anyone else remember all the Ford bulls in 2016? They're not on this sub anymore because they all went broke.

6. I'm no crayon guy. But everyone can see that $30 was a magic line, and drastically going below it to $21 is a market signal that the company is now viewed fundamentally differently. Yes it can go lower, especially the general market trends change we see this week. 

7. AMD spent from 2008 to 2016 an absolute garbage penny stock. You WSBers nowadays don't even know how ridiculed you were for even considering AMD. 2015 to 2017 were peak AMD years on this sub when regards jumped the gun, bought calls because MUH mindfactory data and muh 1% min benchmarks losing them everything over and over again. You kids don't even know struggle. Struggle is putting your 1k paycheck on AMD calls every week thinking this week you will hit. Just to watch Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs dropping a $12 PT downgrade on you when the stock turns even a little bullish. The investment only somewhat paid off in 2018 when AMD traded to 30, but then half the regards lost everything (myself included) when it crashed to 18 in 2 months following Powell's rate hike.

8. Look how quickly sentiment changed for AMD from 2018. This very well could be history repeating itself, as the semiconductor companies have demonstrated over and over again. Intel 18A is a repeat situation of AMD ZEN. The upside cannot be understated.

8. I'm still bullish. Proper execution can bring the company to a $200+ stock. I bought and sold Intel throughout the year. 8000 shares from 35 to 50, sold at 43, bought at 35, sold at 30 before earnings. I was up 130k, lost 100k of it. Bought 2500 shares at 21.30.

But I’m trying not to read too much into either the share price because I’ve seen narratives flip as stock prices change. Meta going from $400 to $100 and back to $400 in a short span is a great example.

I’m an AI engineer with an electrical engineering background, so I have a bit of understanding into what Intel does. I know CUDA gives NVIDIA a huge moat, and Intel’s fab/CPU business—its core business—has often faced delays. These delays have given AMD a chance to catch up, especially with their use of TSMC’s advanced manufacturing nodes. Meanwhile, Intel is trying to catch up in the AI space with OpenCL, an open-source competitor to CUDA, and oneAPI, which aims to provide a unified programming model across different hardware. But it seems like getting developers to move away from NVIDIA’s ecosystem is challenging.

I’d love to have a fact-driven, in-depth discussion about where Intel stands in the chip business, especially considering AMD, TSMC, and NVIDIA. Does Intel have any deep moat today, and where are they bleeding? Are Intel’s investments in AI (acquiring Habana Labs, investing in AI accelerators like Intel Nervana) worthwhile to regain their competitive edge, or is their x86 dominance fading with ARM and RISC-V on the rise?

*What do I mean by this?*

Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing.

Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet.

This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert.

*What exactly is Intel's bet?*

**The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share**

**Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both.**

Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. **The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets.**

With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one.

*What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets?*

Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years.

Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler.

TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

*Should I become a bagholder?*

Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it.

TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

*Should I become a bagholder?*

Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it.

1ei3z3k_NVDA,NVDA,Intel drop should be a lesson for a lot of you,"I've seen a huge amount of posts on this sub for companies like intel, i.e probably value traps 

Rule 1 is do not buy what you don't fully understand. It's so important I think I need to highlight it better it on the sidebar and resources 

If you do not understand the suppliers, the fabs, the future of chip production such as ML, the software side of it such as CUDA that gives Nvidia it's moat etc etc then you should not be buying companies like intel

You will end up writing pages of DD and doing fancy DCF valuations and it will be completey wrong because you just don't understand the future of the industry and business well enough

This is the reason I don't even bother to read the filings of nvda, amd or intel, I would never be able to understand the future for them even though Im far better placed for it than most here as a software engineer using CUDA and ROCM for ML

I also learned this lesson and he hard way previously

1ehij4j_INTC,INTC,Intel (INTC) Bear thesis for Earnings,"Intel has had a rough month.  If you browse the r/pcmasterrace you will see numerous threads about how Intel's most recent line of chips frequently throw errors and cause numerous problems in applications.  This issue has also received decent attention in the press and it effects their entire line of most recent chips, including the commercial sector and server consumers; this issue is not limited to retail consumers.  Intel's response to these reports has been a bit schizo; first denying the problem exists, then claiming they found the issue and had a fix lined up, then announcing there was no possible fix and most recently denying that there would be a recall despite the faults in their product.  This behavior has had a negative impact on consumer sentiment for the company.

  
Recently in the news Intel has announced mass layoffs, there is even a recent thread about his in WSB; this is not a good look as a company enters earnings.  If Earnings were good we wouldn't expect an announcement of mass layoffs, it is another bearish indicator as Intel enters earnings after market closes today.

  
Looking a little deeper into the most recent earnings report and comparing them with google's stock graph over the year, you can see that with the last two earnings reports INTC dropped immediately following earnings.  The last earnings report drop is the most interesting to me since even though Intel reported a slight beat in earnings, the stock dropped over 10% the next day.  I believe the earnings report coming tonight will be very bad for Intel and we will see a similar drop in stock price to what occurred the previous 2 earnings as past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.

  
Counterthesis:  I'm not overly confident in this play.  INTC has dropped around 4% over the last week.  It's possible that investors have already ""priced in"" the expected bad numbers into the upcoming earnings; if so while the earnings report will definitely be bad regardless, they may beat the expected terrible earnings with mere bad numbers and the stock may stay flat or even rise slightly; this is especially true since investors are aware of mass layoffs which will reduce expected costs for the upcoming quarter.

  
Taken as a whole I expect a drop following Intels reported earnings and have bought puts on INTC expiring 2Aug 2024 as a result:

Intel also said it would not pay its dividend in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Here’s how the company did, compared to LSEG analyst expectations:

Earnings per share: 2 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected
Revenue: $12.83 billion vs. $12.94 billion expected
Intel’s revenue declined 1% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 29, according to a statement. The company had a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.47 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The company’s Client Computing Group that makes PC chips contributed $7.41 billion in revenue, up 9% and right around the $7.42 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Intel’s Data Center and Artificial Intelligence unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue. The result was down 3% and lower than the $3.14 billion StreetAccount consensus.

For the fiscal third quarter, Intel called for an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was adjusted net earnings of 31 cents per share and $14.35 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced that Apollo would invest $11 billion in a joint venture around a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland. The company also introduced Xeon 6 server processors, along with a Gaudi 3 accelerator for artificial intelligence workloads.

In addition, Intel disclosed in May that the U.S. Commerce Department was revoking export licenses for consumer items to a customer in China, widely believed to be Huawei. Intel said second-quarter revenue would still be in its previously announced range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, but below the middle of the range.

Excluding the after-hours move, Intel stock has lost 42% of its value so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up almost 14% in the same period.

1ebr68q_INTC,INTC,The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022.,"Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs.

Over the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked.

I first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point.

So i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace  were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues.

So I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.).

Since my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly.

At this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive.

Luckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the ""bad"" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance.

Now for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory.

So now we have 2 symptoms.

* Disk data corruption
* GPU memory corruption

My friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations.

After I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway.

After this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: [Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzHcrbT5D_Y) the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw.

Intel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face ""The Intel CPU in this system has errored"" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.

I have been short Intel since July 15th.

**Edit:**

Ive received internal leaks from Intel employees explaining internal issues and intels failures.

Source 1:

The leading theory inside Intel right now, and it is just a theory, is that the Ring Bus is getting cooked because it's fed by the same rail as the P-Cores and E-Cores. 

Raptor Lake required incredibly high voltages that the clocks required to be competitive with Zen 4, and it seems like it was just pushed too hard. This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. 

Meteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially.



Source 2: 

I never worked directly on Raptor Lake \[Intel Design Engineer\], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. 

I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process...



Source 3: 

I \[Intel Foundry Services\] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. 

It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away.

To be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't ",2024-07-25,83,94

1e1w8a8_INTC,INTC,The case for Intel from a former bear,"Disclaimer: I am long from $35 a share; this is my view on $INTC.

I know r/stocks sees a lot of Intel posts, but none of the ones I've seen really describe the Intel story or, frankly, misunderstand the semiconductor industry entirely.

A little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.

Intel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.

This has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.

But investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?

Let's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.

Intel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.
Next year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there’s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.

Some of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.

Now to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won’t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.

Ultimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long. Let me know in comments, if you are interested.",2024-07-12,253,161

I’m wondering if it has anything to do with Modi’s visit to Russia and the looming Taiwan threat, as it relates to TSMC.

Or maybe they’ve figured out that intel will have the most advanced manufacturing capacity in place for the next several years, after having locked out TSMC on the latest lithography (ASML) machines.

1dowoqn_INTC,INTC,Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom. ",2024-06-26,4129,1313
1dm0h7f_META,META,"Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ","Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.

Apple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”

The runaround is this. INTC reached its low point in Q3 last year at $24 and steadily climbed back to $54 in January. Allegedly also under the impression that it's foundry business is healthy. In their Q1 reporting they changed the way they report  their business units and it was revealed that the foundry lost $2.5B on $4.4B of revenue. So anything but healthy. The stock now is at $30

The lawsuit is about their back reporting of 2023 foundry business though. $19B of revenue with $7B in deficit. The lawsuit claims that Intel knew how bad their foundry business is and that investors were deceived and the loss in 2024 could have been prevented if intel would have been truthful.

But the developing foundry business is gonna get absolutely bananas under #\*\*Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger\*\* who was basically hired for the sole purpose of developing it. They are not gonna let the other chip companies continue to take nut shots on them and they are just gonna make everyone chips for them. 



Anyways I all in on Mar 2025 Calls (which are like $4.50 - $5.00) right now. 



Here is some DD. 

# Dog of the Dow



Intel has lagged behind other chip titans such as \[\[AMD - AMD\]\] and \[\[NVDA -NVIDIA\]\] as they race to design and build chips to handle \[\[AI\]\] workloads. 



Both AMD and NVIDA have seen tremendous growth over the past 18 months (as of June 2024). A growth pattern that has gone completely unanswered by INTEL up until this point. 



Looking at the \[\[Price to Earnings Ratio\]\] of both AMD and NVIDIA it is easy to see how disconnected from earnings they have become (though they are both incredibly profitable). 



AMD P/E Ratio: 67.30

NVIDIA P/E Ratio: 238.53

INTEL P/E Ratio 31.79



AMD is wildly inflated relative to its competition in the space. 

NVDA is has a more ""sane"" price to earnings but it has also been nearly printing its own money with the amount of sales it has been making. The price of NVIDIA still ""feels"" high despite it's recent split. 



Another interesting metric to take a look at is the \[\[Price/Tangible Book\]\] - Where you take the current price of the stock and compare it to the tangle value of all its assets minus good will. 



AMD P/TB Ratio: 23.61

NVIDIA P/TB Ratio: 64.73

INTEL P/TB Ratio: 1.75



This says a few things; One either Intel has barely any assets worth liquidating relative to its stock price and the market has priced the stock appropriately, OR the price of the stock is selling for a very reasonable price related to the actual value of the company. This could be considered paying only .75 above book value of the company as a ""premium"" for future expected value.

# Technical 



Except for this past Wednesday, this company has been hard stuck around $30 after a selloff from its 52 week high of $51.28.

31.50 appears to be the most reliable resistance level we can work off of right now, then $32.50 after that. If it breaks both of those on a run up, there is literally no ceiling until $46. SO, you tell me what that means. 



The further you zoom out on your shitty little trading app the more you will see that this period we are in is nothing but consolidation. 



# Foundry 



Intel's new foundry business will be the corner stone of its future growth. Forget the in house made chips. The company is not-so-silently tyring to be the American version of TSMC. 



Here is an article they posted on their own site outlining their model. 

[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-outlines-new-financial-reporting-structure.html#gs.a8z07s)



Note this section: April 9th 2024

>""Intel Foundry is a newly established operating segment that includes foundry technology development, foundry manufacturing and supply chain, and foundry services (formerly IFS). Under this new structure, Intel Foundry will recognize revenues generated from both external foundry customers and Intel Products..."" 



Fuck me, if they pull this off under #\*\*Bad-Daddy-Gelsinger\*\* who was basically hired for this specific function, this stock could easily moon. 



Not to mention this article detailing that NVIDIA will start using Intels Foundry to start making its own chips. 



https://www.techspot.com/news/101725-nvidia-turning-intel-foundry-services-expand-gpu-ai.html#:\~:text=Nvidia%20could%20also%20choose%20to,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202024.



# Chips Act



> ""U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to advance Intel’s commercial semiconductor projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.

> Intel also expects to benefit from a U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of up to 25% on more than $100 billion in qualified investments and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion.

> Proposed funding supports Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years to expand U.S. chipmaking capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security and acceleration of emerging technologies, such as AI.

> Intel’s investments are expected to create more than 10,000 company jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs, and to support more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries. ""



[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html#gs.a8z5ze)



So yea Intel is gonna get paid, and quite a bit. The article states that they are slated to receive up to $8.5 billion, with a B. 



# X86 chips - Speculation



With Arm taking dominance over portable computers like laptops, tablets and phones, X86 looks pretty boring. Except you have to remember that both AMD and Intel are still cranking these bad boys out like nobody's business. The raw horsepower in these for desktop workstations and servers is still not matched by ARM and probably wont be for quite a while. Sure they are not quite as power efficient, but who cares in a data center or major compute space anyways. 



Intel owns almost all of the IP for X86 processors too. AMD has a little bit and they have made improvements and designs of their own that they have been able to patent, but INTEL is the OG maker of these chips. 



Arm will probably continue to dominate the landscape, but they are the people who license their chips are going to need them made somewhere. They will have like two options. Intel or TSMC. 



# China 



What happens when CHYNA pulls the trigger and takes over Taiwan. Where is everyone gonna have their chips made? Arizona, that's where. TSMC and Intel are both setting up MASSIVE Fabs there. So, when all the other chip companies get absolutely smoked I expect to see a giant green candle on that morning for INTC. 



I will probably write more later but this shit got way long way fast. Ill link back when ever I give a shit enough to write more. 



**Anyways I am fucking right and you know it.**

Might fluctuate higher or lower based on MBLY market price and recent investor interest in AI and self driving technology markets. 

Also for some reason MBLY is being massively shorted with 21% of outstanding shares being shorted.- not sure what this 20% (20m shares) is because theres 806m shares, and INTC only sold 38.5m so far.

1ce5kn0_INTC,INTC,INTC Strangle - Does my thought process make sense?,"
I’m going to preface this by saying that I’m fairly new to trading options. I’ve dabbled in options before but it’s been unstructured, at best.

I wanted to play INTC earnings but I didn’t want to guess the direction. I went long on the 33.5/36.5 strangle for $1.67. I looked at the IV for the 04/26 options and it was at ~140%. To counter the potential IV crush, I went long on the 05/03 strange instead, the IV for which was ~65%.

I decided the $3 width (equidistant from $35, which is where INTC was just before market close on 04/25) based on the at-the-money straddle which had a premium of $2.5 (which translated to an expected ~7.1% move). Looking at the last few earnings of INTC, I saw that it does move around that range (although this might have been heavily skewed by the most recent earnings move). 

My thought process on this position was that I would be closing out the trade the morning after earnings and not holding the week of expiry. So, according to my (likely flawed) analysis, I was only exposing myself to theta decay of one day on a flat earnings move if things went sour.

Thankfully, INTC dropped about 8-8.5% on earnings and I was able to close out the strangle at $2.39. 

I’m looking for comments/critiques of my thought process and what I might not have accounted for so that I can keep getting better. Hoping to learn from the experts on here.

1cc3dtf_TSLA,TSLA,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",2024-04-24,92,100

. . . . . . 

Once known mostly for building PC add-on graphics cards for gamers, Nvidia has transformed its graphics processing units, or GPUs, into the beating heart of the AI revolution, powering the creation of large language models and running the inference software that leverages them in data centers around the world. Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.  
  
But fresh competition is coming—from companies big and small—and the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn’t be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That’s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.

. . . . . . 

A few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make—or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.  
  
Huang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren’t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well—or better—than Nvidia.

. . . . . 

Nvidia’s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won’t be winner-take-all. It isn’t game over. It’s game on.  
  
Nvidia’s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.

1ar592u_NVDA,NVDA,Intelligent Stock Screening,"Hi folks,

A few days ago there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1aoig91/update_intelligent_stock_screeners_and_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this subreddit talking about intelligent stock screening.  The broad topic has some bearing to quantitative trading and automated strategies, so the reply should be appropriate here.

The author had been implementing a large language model to generate results, but this was done to ill effect.  A simple query like ""Find the largest automobile companies with the largest free cash flow increase in the past two years"" resulted, unfortunately, in incorrect replies.  In the words of the author:

>It said NVDA was an automobile company, Ford was a technology company, and AVGO had it its last earnings in early 2023.

As a solution, I recommended doing a more traditional NLP approach to the problem of screening.  Over the past day or so, I had some time to sit down and code up the basics of this approach.  To facilitate the project, I scraped fundamentals data from [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx) and company descriptions from [Fintok](https://www.fintok.io/), and so all results below rely on that data.

While I do not provide the data (`full_data`, below), I do provide the R code for each step of the process for those that are interested (since an R Finance conference post is pinned to the subreddit).

After collecting the data, I created a custom, clean binary document-term matrix by hand as follows:

    library(stopwords)
    library(pbapply)
    library(stringr)
    library(plyr)
    library(dplyr)
    library(tibble)
    library(tm)
    library(tidytext)
    library(tidyr)
    
    clean_text <- function(text_vector, custom_remove = NA, binary = F){
      
      text_vector %>% 
        gsub('\\n','\\\\n',.) %>% 
        gsub(""(www|http:|https:)([^(\\s)]*)"","""",.) %>% 
        gsub('\\\\n','',.) %>% 
        gsub(""[[:punct:] ]+"",' ',.) %>% 
        gsub('[[:digit:]]+', '', .) %>% 
        gsub('[^\x01-\x7F]', '', .) %>% 
        tolower() -> text_vector
      
      stopwords <- unique(c(custom_remove,
                            stopwords(),
                            deframe(stop_words[,1])))
        
      # Make a dtm
      pblapply(1:length(text_vector), function(i){
        
        split <- unlist(str_split(text_vector[i], "" ""))
        counts <- as.data.frame(matrix(table(split), nrow = 1))
        names(counts) <- names(table(split))
        
        clean <- counts[,!(names(counts) %in% c("""",NA,stopwords))]
        clean
        
      }) -> out
      
      dtm <- do.call(""rbind.fill"", out)
      terms <- names(dtm)
      
      pblapply(1:ncol(dtm), function(i){
        
        tmp <- dtm[,i]
        tmp[is.na(tmp)] <- 0
        
        if(binary == T){
          
          tmp[tmp > 0] <- 1
          
        }
        
        tmp
        
      }) -> dtm
      
      dtm <- do.call(""cbind"",dtm)
      dtm <- as.data.frame(dtm)
      colnames(dtm) <- terms
      
      dtm
      
    }
    
    dtm <- clean_text(full_data$fintok_descriptions, binary = T)

While I had initially recommended trying a PCA based recommender, it was quicker/easier/more accurate to simply do keyword filtering and scoring based on three criteria.  The first is **hard inclusion** where ALL terms must be matched.  This is useful for filtering on location.  The second is **soft inclusion** where the more keyword matches there are, the better.  This is useful for finding sub-industries or companies that cross industries.  For example, ""airplane aerospace defense manufactures"" is a fairly specific request where items with more matches get a higher score.  The query ""airplane oil biotechnology"" would be broader, companies having more of these terms getting a higher score.  Finally, I allow for **hard exclusions** where NONE of the terms are allowed for.

The following function calculates these scores, and returns all the stocks which match the hard inclusion and exclusion criteria, ranked by their soft inclusion score.

    screen_description <- function(full_data, dtm, hard_inclusion = NULL, 
                                   soft_inclusion = NULL, hard_exclusion = NULL){
      
      if(!is.null(hard_inclusion)){
      
        vector_hard_inclusion <- clean_text(hard_inclusion, binary = T)
        dtm_hard_inclusion<- dtm[,colnames(dtm) %in% colnames(vector_hard_inclusion)]
        full_data$meets_hard_inclusion <- rowMeans(dtm_hard_inclusion) == 1
      
      }else{
      
        full_data$meets_hard_inclusion <- TRUE
      
      }
    
      if(!is.null(soft_inclusion)){
      
        vector_soft_inclusion <- clean_text(soft_inclusion, binary = T)
        dtm_soft_inclusion<- dtm[,colnames(dtm) %in% colnames(vector_soft_inclusion)]
        full_data$score_soft_inclusion <- rowMeans(dtm_soft_inclusion)
      
      }else{
      
        full_data$score_soft_inclusion <- 0 
      
      }
    
      if(!is.null(hard_exclusion)){
      
        vector_hard_exclusion <- clean_text(hard_exclusion, binary = T)
        dtm_hard_exclusion<- dtm[,colnames(dtm) %in% colnames(vector_hard_exclusion)]
        full_data$meets_hard_exclusion <- rowMeans(dtm_hard_exclusion) > 0
    
      }else{
      
        full_data$meets_hard_exclusion <- FALSE
      
      }
      
      full_data %>% 
        filter(meets_hard_inclusion, 
              !meets_hard_exclusion) %>% 
        arrange(desc(score_soft_inclusion))
      
    }

Nice and simple.  Here are some example outputs.  First, results for firms mentioning ""houston texas"" in their descriptions:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/okvat6h2rnic1.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=08efabaa174805cc1549c2a9889f856b0168bc3e

Now ""automobile"":

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3a1ya9girnic1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=7603ad7dc1185fd0ceab73ad8212dade05d6cb15

Here we see a problem with simple prompts: they can be very inclusive.  Indeed, there are a number of banking and insurance companies on here because they include ""automobile"" in their descriptions.  To refine the search, we can use soft scoring and inclusion.  Here is an example with both:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pu766ps1tnic1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=15adc72b4e9946982f7ab26b1c8a694db85fb6e1

That's a bit better, the results pointing us towards manufacturers of various car parts.

An alternative approach is to try finding companies most similar in description to some other company.  We can do that as follows:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j7ry4k4evnic1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=d33f5ae32729ddcaefe8d794f743916be69125b2

Not bad!  We picked up Toyota and Ford as being similar in their descriptions to General Motors, but we get a whole lot of other companies doing similar things as well!  For brevity, we can do the same for NVDA:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6mhfusdzvnic1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb949c2fc7fedcaadbebf3300f47db4cbc35122

Looks pretty good.

Of course, this is all linked to data on fundamentals as well so we can do additional refinements such as well on market capitalization, volume, etc.  A number of improvements could be made to the above to improve the system, such as having more refined search methods and a NLP parser which takes one natural language string and attempts to fill the criteria (hard/soft inclusion/exclusion).  Much more daunting is NLP based aggregation to facilitate flexible filtering, but that just goes to show the point I'd like to make in this post: sometimes its better to build small dumb systems that do what you want and integrate them into a smart system rather than start with a smart system which don't do what you want and try to wrangle them.

I hope you find this post useful or interesting!",2024-02-15,23,9
1amvit7_GOOGL,GOOGL,Intelligent Stock Screening using Large Language Models,"**Non-Technical Guide**

Imagine you wanted to create 3 different portfolios. They are as follows:

* Invest in the top 3 pharmaceutical stocks with the largest incomes with a market cap below $500 million
* Short the top 7 AI Stocks that were not profitable and had the lowest revenue increases in the past 6 months
* Buy the top 3 AI/Semiconductor stocks with the largest increase income in the past 5 years with a market cap below $200 billion

How would you go do your research? Would you use Google? ChatGPT? Your brokerage? How do you aim to find the specific stocks that fits your investment thesis?

The reality is that none of these sources will help much. Google isn't not going to tell you which stocks have the largest incomes or the lowest revenue increases. Similarly, ChatGPT isn't trained to execute these complex user queries.

Then obviously, your brokerage isn't going to help you. They want you to buy the stocks that are at 52 week highs or are ""daily gainers"". The reason for this is simple: your brokerages want you to execute trades so they make money. Making it easy to find objective information doesn't align with their business goals, so they're not going to invest in that.

However, I recently designed a way to perform this intelligent stock searching using Large Language Models. The way it works is that you start by populating a database full of all of the company information (like if a stock is a pharmaceutical stock vs an AI stock vs a semiconductor stock, etc.) Then, you populate your database full of fundamental data across time, that being revenue, income, price, market cap, PE ratio, and what other metrics you want to search for.

Finally, you will utilize the power of a Large Language Model. The LLM will convert the plain English query into a format that can intelligently search for the data in the database. Specifically, you'll use [function-calling](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/function_calling) and [few-shot prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) to generate a SQL query or a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

Combined, you'll be able to search for stocks that meets your investment goals using natural language! This is extremely powerful. Want to see what biopharmaceutical stocks are actually profitable? Easy! Want to see which airlines are increasing their income each year? Piece of cake! Essentially, you can find **anything** you want to look for in a stock, which allows you to more easily create a basket of stocks for your algorithmic trading strategies!

**Technical Guide**

If you're more interested in the **exact implementation**, I wrote up an entire article for you. It's well worth the read! My post for some reason keep getting auto-deleted when I link the article, so I'll leave it in the comments.

I plan to implement this architecture for myself over the weekend! In the meantime, I'd love to get some overall feedback on this approach. I feel like traders aren't using LLMs like they should, but they are extremely powerful. We've really yet to realize their full potential in finance, and I'd also like to hear about other awesome use-cases you guys can think of.",2024-02-09,54,43
19fk5fp_INTC,INTC,Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.",2024-01-25,462,214

18vjzsf_INTC,INTC,My attempt at DD for INTC in 2024,"Below is my novice attempt at providing half-decent DD in support a thesis. Two caveats: 1) I wanted to focus on US-based companies, and 2) This is a play in my Roth IRA – Buy and Hold long term.

Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I’d heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn’t really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment.

I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP).

Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn’t work, but I’m kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at \~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple.

Design:

I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out.

Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that “in the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on.

Fabrication:

Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world.

But fabs are simply another “system” in the larger system… What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas…

Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL).

US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn’t shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion.

So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components – Who is the CEO, what he’s saying, and what he’s actually doing about it...

The CEO: If there was a “Chips hall of fame,” Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well.

What he’s saying: He’s put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he’s doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs.

What he’s doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two.

My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (\~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares.

I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process.

(edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.",2023-12-31,78,68

### Company Overview:

Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others.

### Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux

Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure.

Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers.

Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift. 

Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence.

Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024.

However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years.

### Recent Financials:

Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market.

Designed to be worn on your wrist, MyAIWatch sTM life-saving

technology helps avoid overdoses and potentially life-  
threatening drug interactions.

AGOURA HILLS CA \[July 25, 2023\] MultiCorp International Inc (OTC Pink: MCIC  
News\] today introduced a new Artificial Intelligence-based device that promises to  
revolutionize medication management for the more than 131 million Americans  
who rely on prescription drugs.  
MyAIWatchTM, a patent-pending technology, is the brainchild of MCICs Acting CEO  
Ben Friedman, whose 40+ years as a licensed pharmacist brought unique insights  
into the technology and programming behind the new smart device. MyAIWatch  
addresses what Ive found is the Number One issue patients on medication face  
every day, comments Mr. Friedman. It enables them to monitor and thereby  
protect themselves from overdoses, unexpected drug interactions, and sudden  
emergencies. All the medication information they need is literally right at their  
fingertips, and constantly refreshed for accuracy. And AI technology takes it a  
step further by providing additional personalized data that can significantly add to  
their health and well-being. ""MyAIWatch is not simply a reporting device...its a proactive technology that communicates directly with the wearers medical team to confirm whether  
prescribed dosages are being taken and signals the wearer each time a dose is  
required. It also alerts their doctor/s to any medical emergency that might arise.  
As an added feature, first responders arriving on the scene of an accident or  
an emergency can simply touch the MyAIWatch device and the patient's list of  
medications will instantly become available a critical factor when administering  
proper life-saving medication for the injured. For patients in hospitals and skilled  
care facilities, the device can be synced with the EHR (Electronic Health Records)  
to ensure medication types and dosages are not mistaken.

A recent study published by the website My Medical Score reveals that  
medication errors cost over $40 billion per year. And between 7,000 and 9,000  
patients die from medication errors every year. ""As a pharmacist, I've seen far too  
many occasions where a physician prescribes a medication without understanding  
the potential drug interactions that can put the patient in harms way, adds Mr.  
Friedman.  
The company stated that MyAIWatch will be in full production and should be  
available to the public and healthcare companies by the end of the first quarter of 2024.  
Further updates will be announced as Beta Testing continues.

14df4ri_INTC,INTC,"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks","BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.  
  
The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.  
  
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".  
  
Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).  
  
The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.  
  
Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.  
  
The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.  
  
Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.  
  
Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.  
  
The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  
  
It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.  
  
Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.  
  
""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

I didn’t post this when it was happening because I didn’t wanna jinx it. $95k was the highest day. Everyone told me to cash out on this day, but I thought I would keep earning. I was wrong. But I still made 47K profit, so not a bad month. 

Wish I would’ve also bought Target puts.

A TD Ameritrade rep told me that for one of my $BUD calls, I was the only person who bought that call. And for another call, I owned more than half of the contracts at that strike price. I found it surprising that after seeing the gravity of the boycott, with shelves full of bud light, more people hadn’t predicted the seemingly imminent dip. The stock is literally named after the beer.

I'm still pretty new to investing (August will be 1 year in the market) and I still don't know much regarding a lot of the details that go into a company's valuation. When I first started investing, I picked up INTC shares for multiple reasons, a number of which are probably not the brightest. This was right around the time of the CHIPs Act which gave me some confidence in Intel as a longer-term holding, and as a student without a full-time job, the idea that my investment would have reasonably frequent dividend payouts to feed back into my portfolio seemed enticing. However, as I'm sure most people here know, Intel was anything but a good investment. I'm down a little over 14%, translating to roughly $124 in value lost. While I've tried to balance things out and diversify (and make more informed decisions), Intel continues to drag my portfolio down. I've been contemplating just cutting losses and pulling out entirely so my deficit doesn't continue to grow, but I wanted to see if anyone had any input before I did so. Does anyone see Intel making any sort of real comeback in 5-10 years' time, or is the consensus that Intel's poor business choices and ineffective leadership have stunted it to the point that it is going to be eternally stuck behind its competition?

But I thought this could provide another example, but for less experienced options traders (like myself admittedly).

For a little background, I am a fundamental analyst through work and have had some decent success doing long term investing with my personal account. I have been learning about options over the past few years and wanted to implement some of the strategies starting last year.

My stock of choice was INTC (joke's on me so far). I started by selling cash covered puts in 2022 when I thought the stock was undervalued. I got assigned the stock as sentiment and financial performance clearly became much worse for INTC and the semiconductor industry in general. My long term analysis still indicates it's undervalued based on current pricing, but I have more recently accepted the short term bearish sentiment and have been selling calls to reduce my breakeven price. The stock has been in a pretty sustained trading range over (\~25 to \~32) the last 6 months, which has helped my strategy. The dividend has also been helping, but was recently reduced so it'll be less of an offset going forward, but might actually be beneficial to the stock price long term.

I have documented trades and strategy/thinking below. Feel free to ask questions or critique. Just hoping to learn some more and hopefully help others learn by example.

119u0f2_INTC,INTC,What do you think about INTC ?,"  

Hello everyone,

intel has cut its dividend by 66% and this is very bad news in the short term, but can this be good news in the long term? the company will be able to better distribute its profits for research and development I think? can intel come back into the race against its competitors? Or do you think that the company has fallen too far behind and that it will be difficult to return to the level of its competitors who are growing rapidly? I think that Intel steel better than AMD for gaming and professional use case i want to have your opinion please.

thanks in advance!",2023-02-23,1,7

1194dmz_INTC,INTC,Time to short Intel?,"While it's been a great time to short Intel for a long while, it's massive reduction in its dividend, means the cost of carry for short positions drops significantly. So is this a good time to enter a new INTC short position?

Lets review the well known arguments for shorting Intel.

**1) It's main moat is x86 and it's crumbling rapidly**

Losing market share to AMD is the most visible sign of this, but hardly the biggest risk.

**2) x86 has a poor performance per watt, that risks the laptop market for Intel.** 

This is demonstrated by Apple Silicon producing laptops with far longer battery life at similar performance levels. Microsoft sees this, as well as other PC OEMs, which is why Microsoft continues to work to enhance their ARM version of Windows. Third party ARM processor manufacturers are working on Apple Silicon level ARM processors and when they release them SurfaceX will leapfrog over intel Surface hardware in performance and battery life. And it's likely Microsoft licenses Windows ARM to other OEMs.

**3) Poor performance per watt also means more heat, which if not solved is going to cost them most of the server market.**

Which is why ARM is gaining market share rapidly in servers. You can support more customers with more servers and more processor power in a hosting facility with ARM because you need less power and less cooling. This is why Amazon's ARM based Graviton platform is by far the fastest growing platform on AWS, its much cheaper than Intel. It originally suffered from the lack of desktop ARM CPUs for developers but Apple has started to solve those problems and in a couple years Microsoft and PC OEMs will make it go away entirely.

**4) It's pouring massive amounts of capital into Fabs, where it's 5 years behind in process size and needs massive volumes to be competitive on price.**

If Intel can catch up in process size it will still fail unless it can sell at massive volumes to maximize their economies of scale to compete on cost with TSMC. But to sell at massive volumes requires getting some of the largest customers for cutting edge process size production. And Intel competes directly with all of the largest potential customers for it's fabs, AMD, Apple, nVidia, Samsung, etc, etc. 

How likely is it they will want to provide their most advanced proprietary designs to Intel fabs knowing there is a risk any of their proprietary IP will leak over to the x86 division?  How much do they want to help their competitor by giving it business? How low will Intel have to go in pricing to overcome these objections?

**5) Fabs are a cyclical business, and will likely be in a glut when Intel's fabs come online.**

They are cyclical because demand prediction is difficult and supply prediction is impossible. As we entered a shortage a few years ago,  hundreds of billions in capital was committed to building new fabs that can't come online for 3-4 years minimum. When all those fabs hit the market at once, supply is going to skyrocket, and that is likely going to lead to a glut and a price war. TSMC is well positioned for this war because it controls most of the industry volume, has tight relationships with leading customers (that it doesn't compete with) and that mass volume gives it industry beating low costs. 

As always this isn't a recommendation to make any investment decision. Do your own research, I may be wrong, I may have missed out on important other factors, etc, etc.",2023-02-22,72,173

Many companies tout AI technology initiatives and machine learning. But there really are few public, pure-play AI stocks.

In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence technology to improve products or gain a strategic edge. Amid a surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence, be on guard against poor performing companies that tout themselves as plays on AI stocks.

Microsoft (MSFT)  has increased its stake in startup OpenAI as it aims to take on Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) in internet search. 

Also, Microsoft and Google in early February hosted media events highlighting artificial intelligence initiatives and investments. Analysts said Microsoft came out ahead in terms of describing its product strategy and  showcasing ChatGPT technology from OpenAI.

ChatGPT is only one of many ""generative AI"" technologies that could roil a host of industries by creating text, images, video and computer programming code on their own. Generative AI technology already is finding applications in marketing, advertising, drug development, legal contracts, video gaming, customer support and digital art.


Key to the rise of generative AI are improved natural language processing models that help computers understand the way that humans write and speak. OpenAI is part of a wave of NLP startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere and others. All AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. And the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.

In addition, Bank of America is bullish on AI and internet companies.

""Use of AI will be critical driver of all things Internet, including content relevance, ad performance, e-commerce conversion, marketplace efficiency and even customer service,"" BofA analyst Justin Post said in a recent note to clients.

**Last Week – Late rally saves the week.**

SPY was lower by about 0.6% last week but ended on a strong note with a near 2% rally off its lows of the week on Thursday. The move on the week was inside the 1.3% move options were pricing. The VIX ended thr week unchanged as did near-term IV, with SPY options still in the low to mid-teens for the next two weeks. Things change the first week of February as we hear from the FOMC and see the latest employment and inflation data. Those weeks have consistently seen higher IV across the market, looking almost like a monthly earnings report on the expected move chart (Feb 3rd IV highlighted, note the bulge in the expected move chart for that week):

&#x200B;

**This Week – Again, relatively Low IV into this week’s earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we’ve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

Looking at some of the big names reporting this week, we see MSFT options 41 IV versus about 36 realized vol for the past year. So MSFT options are pricing a move for earnings slightly more than an average week (but not by much). TSLA options are similar, 81 IV this week versus 67 realized the past year. INTC options stick out as quite pumped versus the past year. IV for this week is 67 versus 39 realized for the past year. INTC has actually moved a lot on its recent earnings, with moves of +10%, -9%, -7%, and 7% (with the +10% most recent). That helps explain this week’s 7% expected move.

So looking at those 3 examples, there are none that are as low as the situation we saw last week in GS, but among the three MSFT options are the cheapest versus last year’s realized and INTC’s are the most expensive, needing a move similar to what the stock saw its past 4 earnings in order for options to not have been overpriced. As an example of a neutral trade, selling that earnings move, an Iron Condor expiring this Friday in INTC would currently need the stock to close the week between 26.80 and 31.20 following its report to see max gain. Here’s how that looks on a 3-month stock chart (see [this trade ](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/INTC/iron-condor)and others on Options AI’s free trade tool):

10hyf98_INTC,INTC,"Valuing Semiconductor manufacturers and a look at INTC, AMD, TSM and MU","I would like to build a position in a semiconductor manufacturer as their valuations come under pressure in the downturn for this cycle. I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. 

As I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary.

AMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock.

TSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states.

Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

&#x200B;

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP’s**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

&#x200B;

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

Stock Evaluation (TLDR: $36.08, Undervalued)","**EDIT: DISCLAIMER: This post is obsolete, i fixed some data and add some valuation methods in the new post, check it out** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/y27b2p/intel_corp_a_quick_evaluation_part_ii_with/)

Good Evening folks!

*I am a student that has recently found a passion for financial analysis and evaluation of companies. In fact, i would like to be a Financial Analysis my self in the future, thus i am practicing with some fundamentals and analysis for now! Sharing here so you can judge and maybe give some advice c:*

*So, let's start!*

# CAPM and Beta

* **Levered Beta**: 0.71
* **Unlevered Beta**: 0.56
* **CAPM**: 7.22% which will be used in the Discounted Cash Flow

&#x200B;

# Evaluation Methods

To evaluate the fair price per share i used 3 approaches and the calculated the average of them:

|Method|Price|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham**|$34.39|Used the Adjusted formula which has: P/E of 7; growth rate of 1%; AAA Bond yield of 4.77%|
|**CFO Evaluation**|$26.56|7.22% Discount rate and 1%growth rate. It gives a MCap of 108.88 B|
|**Discounted Cash Flow**|$37.13|Here i used analysts growth rate for next year and projected the growth rate of 17% for 5 years. (I did not discounted debt from it)|
|**Average Price per Share**|$32.69|The Average price of those 3 methods|

**Current price is $25.20**, which puts Intel in the **Undervalued** category

**Edit:** *if i use my growth rate of 1% also for the DCF, we have a price of* ***$14.99*** *for the Discounted Cash Flow method, bringing the* ***Average Price to $25.31***, that is interesting hm

&#x200B;

# Risk Analysis

By Observing the historical variation of the Free Cash Flow of Intel for the last 13 years, we have the following data:

|Risk Free Rate|3.89%|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return (consensus)|9.87%|
|Average Return|8.18%|
|**Adjusted Return**|**4.30%**|
|Variance (risk rate)|10.57%|
|**adjusted Risk**|**6.68%**|
|Standard Deviation|32.51%|

The company doesnt have that much risk based on historical data set, which without factoring possible outliers in the future, we can declare the stock a low risk stock, with its **adjusted risk of only 6.68%** and an **adjusted return of 4.30%**

&#x200B;

# Ratios

|Cash Burn Rate|0.82|The company is burning its Cash and Cash Equivalents in an unexpected rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Month Remaining**|9.84|The company can cover its short term expenses only for 9 months more without taking any debt|
|**Working Capital**|1.86|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.16|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash|
|**ROE**|\-0.45%|Non that bad but not good|
|**ROA**|\-0.41%|Non that bad but not good|

# Ratios Comments

* We can clearly see that the company cannot cover its short term dues within **9 months** only by its Cash, and if the company doesn't do something, which they will, it can go tits up.
* Its current assets do cover its short term expenses if Cash isnt enough, liquidation of current assets cn cover it.
* Acid Test tells us that they will take some short term debts to cover the short term expenses.
* ROE and ROA arent that bad, they tells us that the company is in a situation between falling and recovering.

# Conclusions

As we can see from this quick analysis, the company isnt in that great shape, but still, it is not dying neither! Taking in mind the macroeconomics and geopolitics factors, it is reasonable the current short term down trend of the stock.

* We can see this with the **CFO analysis**, which factors only the current CFO and project it t the near future, this gives us the indication that in the short period, the stock will continue to drop in value following the overall market trend.
* With the **Adjusted Graham formula**, e can see that the long term intrinsic value of the company is much much higher that the current one.
* Meanwhile the **Discounted Cash Flow model** suggests us a price near the Adjusted Graham ones, but this shall be take in consideration if we have a FCO average growth of 17% for the next 5 years, which is hard with the growing competition.

I will set its fair value as the average of those 3 results: **$32.69** (this price valuation doesnt take in count future and possible developments, good or bad, and it is the value of the company based on todays data).

**Risk Analysis** was used to determine whether this is a dangerous investment, with turns out to be not. Intel has a low market risk: **6.68%** (Variance - Risk Free Rate). This result is understandable due to the fact that our modern world runs on chips. which intel is a manufacturer. We can expect at least a 30% surprise maximum variation maximum for the FCF variation factoring unexpected events.

**My overall Conclusion:** Expecting some news from the company about its current short term expenses, probably some cuts or more workers laid off. In the short term the price is destined to plunge more, but in the long run i still see a good value in it. I would by in, average down probably, and hold for at least 5 years before thinking of selling.

*What do you think? Do you have any suggestions? Advices? I would like to improve and learn more from you guys! Feel free to comment :D*

**TLDR**: Fair Value of **$32.69,** The stock is Undervalued for the Long Run, Short Term price will fall

On Aug. 23, Intel announced a new co-investment program with Brookfield Asset Management to help fund Intel’s manufacturing expansion in Arizona and thus accelerate the firm’s IDM 2.0 strategy. Specifically, Intel will fund 51% and Brookfield will fund 49% of the $30 billion investment. Management has been stressing it expects to offset part of the hefty capital expenditure outlays required for its internal and foundry manufacturing aspirations via smart capital offsets, or government subsidies, private investment programs, and foundry customer prepayments.

We are maintaining our $50 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Intel. While we view shares as undervalued for long-term, patient investors, we acknowledge that the next several quarters will be tumultuous for the firm. We remain positive on Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy and expect the recently passed Chips Act and the agreement with Brookfield to boost the firm’s returns on invested capital over time.

Intel’s capital intensity has risen sharply this year, as we expect capital expenditures to be about $23 billion, or 35% of total revenue. Although we model capital intensity to be in the 30% range going forward as Intel embarks upon its investment phase, management targeted a long-term net capital intensity of 25% as smart capital offsets ease Intel’s financial burden.

We appreciate that the return Intel will pay to Brookfield will be below Intel’s cost of equity (about 8.5%) but above its cost of debt (about 4.4%). In the coming years, the deal's structure will provide a $15 billion cumulative benefit to Intel’s adjusted free cash flow as the fabs are built and ramped, with cash inflows and outflows better aligned, which should in turn allow the firm to maintain its dividend. Once the fabs are built and generate cash flows, Intel will then offer a relatively stable return to Brookfield, which should enable Intel to capture more of any potential upside as well as break even earlier than if it funded the fab on its own.

**Business Strategy and Outlook** | by Abhinav Davuluri Updated Jul 29, 2022

Intel is the leader in the integrated design and manufacturing of microprocessors found in PCs and servers. With the rise in interconnectivity of devices, Intel strives to provide the most powerful and energy-efficient silicon solution to any product ""smart and connected."" The data centers used to facilitate the information stored, analyzed, and accessed by various front-end devices are mostly run with Intel server chips.

Intel historically differentiated itself first and foremost via the execution of Moore's law, which predicts transistor density on integrated circuits will double about every two years, meaning subsequent chips have substantial power, cost, and size improvements. This scaling advantage was perpetuated through higher-than-peer-average R&D and capital expenditure budget that allows it to control the entire design and manufacturing process in an industry where the majority of competition focuses on only one phase. However, the firm had issues with its 10-nanometer process in recent years, and subsequently announced its 7-nm (Intel 4) process will be delayed until 2023, thus opening the door for competitors such as AMD to gain share.

As cloud computing continues to garner significant investment, Intel's data center group has been an indirect beneficiary. Mobile devices are the preferred device to perform computing tasks and access data via cloud infrastructures that require large-scale server build-outs. This development has provided strong tailwinds for Intel's lucrative server processor business. We believe Intel will experience continued growth in the data center, though we note competition from AMD and customers designing their own ARM-based silicon are potent risks.

The proliferation of mobile devices has come at the expense of the mature PC market, Intel's historical stronghold, with ARM and its cohorts joining AMD as chief rivals. The rise of artificial intelligence has also unleashed a new competitor in Nvidia for specialized chips to accelerate AI-related workloads. Consequently, Intel is now pursuing an array of non-CPU endeavors, including a discrete GPU for AI and other data center workloads. Intel will also offer its own foundry services.

**Economic Moat** | by Abhinav Davuluri Updated Jul 29, 2022

We are lowering our moat rating for Intel to narrow from wide, as we are no longer certain that the firm can generate excess returns on capital over the next few years. We still believe Intel possesses cost advantages realized in the design and manufacturing of its cutting-edge microprocessors and intangible assets related to its x86 instruction set architecture license and chip design expertise. However, we believe Intel's cost advantage has eroded, as it faced significant product delays associated with its various 10-nanometer process technologies. Intel's x86 rival, AMD, and its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, have combined to leapfrog Intel in cutting-edge processors. In turn, in recent years, Intel has lost market share, conceded on pricing, and faced a sharp decline in gross margins and returns on invested capital. We believe that it is more likely than not that Intel can close the gap with TSMC/AMD and generate excess returns on capital over the next decade, but this is no longer a certainty, and we concede that Intel's manufacturing inferiority to TSMC/AMD will persist for the next year or two and perhaps longer.

Intel primarily designs and manufactures central processing units, or CPUs, for PC and data center end markets. We believe Intel’s narrow moat is predominant in these business lines. Intel’s cost advantage is manifested via large scale semiconductor fabrication facilities that cost $20 billion-plus and create significant barriers to entry. Intel’s only competition for leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing is TSMC and Samsung. Semiconductor manufacturing is inherently capital-intensive and thus requires methodical planning and execution to keep the cost per chip at a reasonable level. Intel accomplishes this through investments in the latest process technologies.

Following along the pathway prescribed by Moore's law, coined by one of Intel's chief founders Gordon Moore, the number of transistors per unit area doubles approximately every two years. As process technologies develop, the cost per unit area increases while the unit area per transistor decreases. Thus, by netting these two trends, Intel is able to decrease the cost per transistor with each successive technology node. Intel has pioneered key innovations such as Fin field-effect, or FinFET, transistors (3D transistors) at its 22-nm process that allowed superior power, performance, and (smaller) area (whereas TSMC and Samsung didn’t implement FinFET until their 16- and 14-nm processes, respectively).

However, for the economics of the business to be pragmatic, there needs to be strong demand via differentiated products that can be sold at high margins and sufficient volumes. Over the years, Intel has managed to maintain high prices for its leading-edge processors in the PC and data center markets. In turn, the company can reinvest in state-of-the-art fabs and a massive research and development (R&D) budget, in order to innovate on the next generation of best-in-breed processors. Intel remains the vast market leader in x86 PC and server CPUs (80%-plus market share in aggregate, per Mercury Research) and this virtuous cycle has served Intel well over the past few decades.

In addition, Intel also boasts intangible assets related to its x86 license and chip design and process technology expertise. The x86 ecosystem (in which both Intel and AMD’s core products coexist), is representative in the vast majority of PC and server CPUs. Intel initially developed x86 in 1978 and licensed the architecture to AMD, in order to satisfy conditions from IBM that required a second source of chips. Intel and AMD are the primary licensees of x86 and owners of x86 intellectual property, as they have a cross-licensing agreement that covers the x86 patent portfolio and would be terminated if either firm was acquired or had a change of control. Effectively all computer software written to run on PCs and servers is written specifically for the x86 architecture, which makes it challenging for non-x86 chipmakers (such as those that license ARM architecture, such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, or others) to encroach upon Intel and AMD’s x86 CPU turf. In turn, both Intel and AMD have been able to maintain high pricing on its x86 processors and fend off any ARM-based upstarts.

In CPUs, we believe that high customer switching costs are pervasive within the x86 ecosystem, as a wide variety of software is written to be optimized on x86 processors from Intel and AMD. These switching costs have likely kept ARM-based processor suppliers at bay over the years. However, we do not attribute switching costs as a moat source to Intel because its PC and server CPU customers can switch somewhat easily between Intel and AMD CPUs. In fact, Intel may benefit from some modest switching costs over AMD in the data center, most notably around the software and support provided to server customers. The life cycle of such devices is also rather short, meaning a design win into a given PC or server model does not guarantee decades of repeat business.

We believe that Intel still benefits from both a cost advantage and intangible assets around x86, although we acknowledge that the business is under assault from a variety of angles, all of which have led us to reduce our moat rating for Intel to narrow from wide. The biggest concern of ours in recent years has been Intel's manufacturing delays with its 10-nanometer process. The company's ineffectiveness in delivering these processors to market has ""broken"" the firm's former virtuous cycle and its “tick-tock” strategy, in which the firm advanced it technology node every two years to reduce feature sizes (the tick), while it launched a new architecture for its microprocessors during the years in between (the tock). In turn, TSMC and AMD have taken the technological lead in x86 products.

Intel has lost about 10 percentage points of PC CPU market share to AMD, from 90% share in 2018 to 80% share in the first half of 2022. In server CPUs, AMD’s share has gone from 2% in 2018 to about 15% in the first half of 2022. We also believe Intel has conceded on price, to prevent this share loss from becoming even worse. Similarly, Intel’s GAAP gross margins have deteriorated from 62% in 2018 to a low of 37% in the second quarter of 2022 (though we expect a rebound to around 50% in the coming quarters).

We believe that 2022 will be a technological (and, likely, a financial) ""bottom"" for Intel, as we think TSMC and AMD will remain on the manufacturing forefront. We expect Intel to get back on track with its Intel 4 process node (ramping in 2023) thanks to the insertion of EUV lithography that will greatly simplify its manufacturing process. We also expect Intel to utilize TSMC for some ""chiplets,"" or chip parts, to ensure Intel can meet its milestones for product releases. The next major transistor innovation expected to succeed FinFET is gate all-around, or GAA, that will allow chipmakers to continue traversing Moore’s Law. TSMC and Samsung are expected to deploy GAA in future processes (3-nm and below), and we believe Intel has an opportunity to be more competitive if it can better deploy GAA.

We don't necessarily believe these moves will allow Intel to leapfrog TSMC/AMD, but they should bring Intel much closer to its rivals (especially when factoring in TSMC’s own delay of its 3-nm process from 2022 to 2023). Even if Intel has further delays and continues to lag TSMC for an even longer period of time than we anticipate, we still foresee Intel having a manufacturing advantage over nearly every other chipmaker. Additionally, we think customers will continue to source products from Intel (either directly or via its foundry efforts), primarily to avoid concentration risk with TSMC.

Outside of x86 chip manufacturing, Intel and the x86 ecosystem faces the risk of displacement from ARM-based processors.

ARM-based chips (the primary competition for x86-based chips) have proliferated mobile computing, including nearly every smartphone and tablet, but have had very little success in displacing x86 in PCs and server (until very recently) due to the costs of rewriting software and lack of sufficient performance. We expect ARM-based chips to generate some traction in the coming years. Apple's shift has been most notable, as it has deployed its own ARM-based CPUs, the M1 and M2, within its Mac computers. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, and a host of others are focused on ARM-based processors, too. However, we think this transition will be slow.

One critical area dominated by x86 is gaming, with both PC gaming and premium video game consoles heavily centered on x86-based processors. Usually, x86-based platforms have more powerful CPUs and GPUs with many compute cores and memory, which are important factors when trying to maximize performance (including framerate and graphical fidelity). While the broader PC market has plateaued over the past decade (before a COVID-19-related resurgence in 2020 and 2021), the PC gaming sub-segment remains a robust market that we expect will remain x86-centric as we’re skeptical the majority of high-end PC games will be rewritten for ARM-based computers any time soon.

In servers, several leading hyperscale cloud customers have been interested in ARM-based CPUs for years, with Amazon notably designing its own ARM-based Graviton processors. However, we believe these ARM-based chips will remain limited to relatively less-intensive workloads, and we do not foresee Amazon or its peers such as Microsoft or Google converting 100% of its data center workloads to ARM-based processors. While switching from x86 to ARM is not impossible and does happen, we believe the bar that needs to be cleared is higher: the chip needs to be faster, more efficient, cheaper, and have the support to port over. Rewriting software to run on a different architecture is a considerable hurdle that we think will stifle ARM inertia in the coming years.

Outside of x86 PC and server processors, we like Intel's efforts to diversify its business via organic and inorganic efforts, including the pursuit of burgeoning opportunities in the Internet of Things, AI, and automotive. Intel acquired two narrow-moat firms in recent years (Altera for FPGAs and Mobileye for automotive computer vision processors) and AI startups such as Habana Labs, Nervana, and Movidius. Given the relatively smaller contribution to total sales, we don’t view these adjacencies as material to Intel’s narrow moat rating at this juncture. That said, we anticipate Intel’s sales in AI accelerators, 5G basestation SoCs, networking, and other server chips will outpace the firm’s PC and server CPU businesses in the coming years.

Additionally, Intel plans to offer foundry services to fabless chip designers. Amazon, Qualcomm, and MediaTek have already signed up as partners, and we suspect that Intel will strive to win future business from Apple, as well. We think Intel’s foundry business will require at least a few years to build the credibility required for high-volume orders, but we ultimately expect Intel to emerge as a decent rival to TSMC and Samsung in the foundry industry.

Regarding the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (approved by the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives in July 2022), we expect Intel to enjoy some subsidies (beginning in 2023), as part of the funds from the legislation (about $39 billion) will be available for the construction and expansion of chipmaking facilities. These funds should help Intel fund its increasing capital expenditure plans for its internal and foundry manufacturing efforts, in turn boosting ROICs. However, we do not consider government subsidies as part of our moat rating.

**Fair Value and Profit Drivers** | by Abhinav Davuluri Updated Aug 11, 2022

Our fair value estimate is $50 per share. We expect revenue to be down 16.6% in 2022, primarily due to competitive pressures, a weaker macro environment, and the divestiture of Intel's NAND business to SK Hynix. When excluding NAND, we expect total 2022 sales to be down 11%. Over the next five years, we assume revenue to grow at a 2% CAGR. We see Intel’s PC-derived revenue declining in the mid-single digits on average over the next five years as Intel deals with a more competitive AMD and share loss at Apple. In the data center and AI segment, we think competition from AMD will be the fiercest, as it captures share at cloud customers with superior products over the next year or two. Over the next five years, we think DCAI sales will grow in the low single digits.

The firm’s auxiliary segments (networking, graphics, foundry, and Mobileye) are key growth drivers, though they remain a relatively smaller portion of total sales. In the near term, we're most constructive on Intel's network and edge, or NEX, business, which includes networking chips sold into data centers, 5G networks, and the intelligent edge. We estimate midteens growth for NEX over the next five years. Intel's foundry and graphics segments are likely to approach $3 billion to $5 billion in annual sales by 2026, respectively, in our view.

As AMD renewed its competitiveness, Intel's gross margins have declined from the low-60s to the mid-40s recently. We think the biggest headwind has been data center pricing. We expect 2022 to be a near-term trough of 45% and gross margins to remain in the low-50s for a few years. In 2025, management expects gross margins to return to the mid-50s due to improved process technologies (lower costs), better pricing for leading products (better performance), superior business mix and scale, and fiscal discipline. We expect some margin expansion in the coming years, though we expect long-term gross margins to remain around 54%.

Intel’s historical market leadership benefits from sizable R&D expenses, which is critical to the firm’s ability to maintain its advantage, though the firm has faced manufacturing delays more recently. Going forward, we believe the firm's drive to ramp new process technologies at a faster pace will pressure margins by a few hundred basis points. We think the firm can drive operating leverage with more-focused research and development spending toward data center and AI end markets, leading to operating margins returning to the mid-20s over time.

**Risk and Uncertainty** | by Abhinav Davuluri Updated Jul 29, 2022

Our uncertainty rating for Intel is high, as we incorporate the cyclicality of the chip space and increased competitive pressures and manufacturing challenges faced by the firm. The cyclical industry in which Intel operates could cause its profitability to fluctuate regardless of how successful it is in tailoring its chips to new markets. The threats posed by AMD in x86 CPUs, ARM-based CPUs developed by Intel’s customers, Nvidia’s first-mover advantage in AI, and Intel’s recent manufacturing struggles with its 10-nm process collectively underpin our uncertainty rating.

Intel’s manufacturing issues delayed the launch of its 10-nm CPUs, while AMD’s partnership with TSMC at the 7-nm process led to AMD capturing market share in both PC and server CPUs. Both TSMC and Samsung reached the 7-nm node (in high volume capacity) in 2018, with TSMC ramping its 5-nm process in 2020. We note that TSMC’s 7-nm process is roughly comparable to Intel’s 10-nm.

Intel’s 7-nm (Intel 4) process delay until 2023 means its chips on that process will be at least a year behind chips made on a comparable process at TSMC. Management expects Intel to outsource some portion of its chips to TSMC beginning in 2023 to retain product leadership, which we view as prudent course of action.

Some of Intel’s major customers have begun to utilize more chips from AMD or develop their own ARM-based chips. Amazon has deployed ARM chips in its AWS cloud and Apple has designed its own ARM chips for its PCs. With Nvidia in the process of acquiring ARM, there is heightened risk that more ARM-based CPUs will threaten Intel’s x86 CPU hegemony.

On the environmental, social, and governance front, we do not foresee any material issues on the horizon. Perhaps the greatest risk is the potential scarcity of experienced chip design talent within the industry. We appreciate the hiring of new CEO Pat Gelsinger in 2021, as he boasts a strong technical background that we think has spurred the return of former top chip designers.

**Capital Allocation** | by Abhinav Davuluri Updated Mar 02, 2022

We assign Intel with Standard capital allocation rating. The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet, fair investments associated with the firm’s strategy and execution, and attractive and appropriate shareholder distribution policies.

Intel has a sound balance sheet along with a conservative financing policy. At the end of 2021, the firm held about $38.1 billion in total debt and $28.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We think the firm generates sufficient cash flow and has ample resources to meet its debt obligations, capital expenditure requirements, potential acquisitions, and shareholder returns.

The firm’s investments have ranged from commendable (Mobileye) to subpar (McAfee) and in between (Altera). We believe the firm must refocus its strategic investments toward its core competencies around design and manufacturing of high-value solutions such as data center CPUs and AI processors.

Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy calls for the firm to get its manufacturing back on track while outsourcing some products to TSMC and also offering its own foundry services. Capital intensity will rise to about 35% in 2022, with capital expenditures being guided to $27 billion. We think Intel's process roadmap through 2025 looks compelling as it includes annual performance increases, EUV adoption, and a new transistor structure for 2024. That said, we think Intel faces considerable execution risk.

In January 2021, Intel announced Pat Gelsinger will replace Bob Swan as CEO. Gelsinger has a rich technology background, having served as VMware CEO since 2012 and spending the first 30 years of his career at Intel. At Intel, Gelsinger was the firm’s first chief technology officer and also led 14 different microprocessor programs, including key roles in the Xeon (server) and Core (PC) product families. At VMware, Gelsinger was instrumental in transitioning the firm from a pioneer in data center virtualization into a critical component of cloud infrastructure. When Swan took over the CEO role in 2019, we were skeptical of Swan’s finance-oriented background as he appeared out of place relative to peers such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su, both engineers. As Intel confronts competitive pressures and manufacturing challenges, we think Gelsinger’s technical and engineering expertise will serve the firm well in navigating these uncertainties.

In January 2022, Intel named David Zinsner its new CFO. Zinsner had been Micron's CFO since 2018 and helped the memory supplier greatly improve its balance sheet while maintaining adequate investments in new memory technologies and capacity. We like the move as both Intel and Micron boast capital intensive businesses that require prudent spending and capital allocation, for which we believe Zinsner has demonstrated a penchant.

The success of the firm's recent forays into new markets is still up for debate. Intel failed to break into smartphones, which is the stronghold of ARM-based processors, and even paid $1.4 billion to acquire Infineon's wireless connectivity chip business in 2011 to support the endeavor. The firm garnered solid traction at Apple with modem design wins in the iPhone 11. In 2019, it sold its 5G modem business to Apple, which we view as a wise decision given the weaker economics of smartphone components relative to Intel's PC and server CPUs.

In 2015, Intel acquired Altera for $16.7 billion, mainly to serve large data center customers looking to leverage FPGAs in applications such as AI. While we viewed the rationale for this deal positively, Intel hasn't derived meaningful revenue synergies from the acquisition. In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion, in order to kick-start its prospects in autonomous driving. In December 2021, Intel announced it is looking to publicly list shares in its Mobileye self-driving automotive unit in mid-2022. The relisting could value Mobileye at north of $50 billion according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Intel will maintain majority ownership of Mobileye, which we think is prudent. Although we think Mobileye has rosy growth prospects, we think this capital allocation decision to unlock value via an IPO for the ADAS leader is a wise move for Intel as it will allow them to focus more on its core chip design and manufacturing business.

In 2020, Intel announced it will sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for $9 billion. We like the deal as the company streamlined its focus on its core competency of CPU design and manufacturing.

In 2022, Intel announced it will acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion. We think acquiring Tower will kickstart Intel's foundry business, as Intel gains a fabless customer base, additional global fab capacity, and IP libraries and customer support capabilities. Tower's mature/specialty capacity also complements Intel's leading-edge logic offerings, while Intel offers Tower the scale to better compete with larger foundry peers.

Intel, Brookfield to invest up to $30 bln in Arizona chip factories

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO) on Tuesday agreed to jointly fund up to $30 billion for the U.S. chipmaker's leading-edge chip factories in Arizona, fueling Intel's ambition to bring more chip production onshore without weighing on its balance sheet.

Brookfield's infrastructure affiliate will invest up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the expansion project, while Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the two chip factories meant to make advanced chips in Chandler, Arizona.

The investment is an expansion of an agreement signed by Intel and Brookfield in February to explore finance options to help fund new Intel manufacturing sites.

The two companies didn't disclose specific terms. David Zinsner, Intel's finance chief, told analysts the interest rate was between 4.4% and 8.5%, which is more expensive than debt financing but cheaper than equity financing.

For private capital providers like Brookfield, foundries represent a cash-flow generating investment opportunity resembling private equity investments in infrastructure, such as data centers and fiber, signaling investors' long-term confidence in semiconductor demand.

Through the deal, Intel could preserve debt capacity for other priorities with financing commitment for a multi-year project, while maintaining operational control.

Zinsner expects this could be the first of many similar financing structures the semiconductor industry explores.

The deal also comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this month signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, which included provision of $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research.

Zinsner said the arrangement between the companies ""builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.""

After Pat Gelsinger took over the reins of Intel in early 2021, the company announced multibillion-dollar investments across Europe and in the United States.

They were aimed at increasing Intel's chip production after the industry went through an over two-year long supply crunch that derailed production of cars to computers.

Last month, Intel slashed its annual forecasts due to falling PC demand. read more

t65ubm_INTC,INTC,"Intel (INTC) Stock Falls on Morgan Stanley Downgrade to Underweight, Analyst Says 'All-or-Nothing Situation' Carries High Risk","""Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are down 2% in pre-open Thursday after Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $47.00 per share (down from the prior $55.00).

Although Moore says he likes the turnaround story that is underway at Intel, he argues that “the next couple of years are likely to see the stock move sideways and we see more actionable opportunities elsewhere in our coverage.

In particular, Moore prefers GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) to Intel as the former “acts as a hedge against the risk of both US gov't support for domestic foundry and new business opportunities moving out of Asia as customers diversify.”

“While INTC is betting big on its foundry business, and recently purchased a smaller foundry in Tower Semiconductor, GFS already has a strong and growing customer base based on proven know-how and manufacturing capability,” Moore said in a client note.

In essence, Moore doesn’t see a clear positive catalyst path for Intel.

“The aggressive investment in capacity in pursuit of revenue growth opportunities in foundry and graphics point to minimal free cash flow in the next couple of years - as guided, to be clear - but also drive a substantial increase in the underlying components of cost of sales (depreciation, labor, and overhead seem likely to rise 40%+ in the forecast horizon, in contrast to sales growth that's forecasted to be negative this year and low single digits next year),” the analyst added.

Moreover, Moore questions whether Intel can still be seen as a value play as “the reality is that ramp of fixed costs create a more ""all-or-nothing"" situation where the company is going to need to succeed in these new businesses - and still turn around their core business - or be looking at long term gross margin and cash flow degradation.”

The analyst also upgraded GFS to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $72.50 per share price target, while downgrading Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Teradyne (NASDAQ: TER) Equal-Weight from Overweight""

t63u7i_INTC,INTC,Intel (INTC) or Globalfoundries (GFS)?,"In a note today Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Globalfoundries Inc (NASDAQ: GFS) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $72.50, up from $70 (21.64% upside). 

Moore downgraded Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) from Equal-Weight to Underweight and announced a $47 price target (3.83% downside).

Moore prefers GlobalFoundries over Intel, given his view that the former acts as a hedge against the risk of U.S. government support for domestic foundry and new business opportunities moving out of Asia as customers diversify. 

While Intel is betting big on its foundry business and recently purchased a smaller foundry in Tower Semiconductor Ltd (NASDAQ: TSEM), GlobalFoundries already has a solid and growing customer base based on ""proven know-how and manufacturing capability,"" Moore says.

t4arvf_INTC,INTC,INTC insiders have purchased additional shares during the latest yearly low for INTEL share price. CEO and Director purchase shares.,"INSIDER ACTIVITY ALERT

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and Chairman Omar Ishrak were part of a group of insiders who bought stock when it dipped in late October. Last week, both men bought more Intel stock as shares edged lower.

On Tuesday, Gelsinger paid $247,890 for 5,600 shares, a per-share average price of $44.27. That day, Ishrak paid $ 497,323 that day for 11,025 shares, an average price of $45.11 each. Gelsinger now owns 268,947 Intel shares and Ishrak owns 46,224 shares.

A former Intel bear upgraded the stock to Market Perform from Underperform last week. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso thinks his bearish thesis has played out. 

Gelsinger told us earlier this month that Intel can be the stock market's ""next great growth story.""

Intel didn't respond to a request to make Gelsinger and Ishrak available for comment.

[NVDA Forecast](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=NVDA)

INTC: BUY: Jan 19 2024 Call option at $50 strike costs about $7.5 per call

For short term if INTC goes to around $56 the option will be worth around $11.7 (it was this price on october 21 , 2021) so you can sell early (before expiration), or for longer term strategy, just hang in there until INTC builds their new factories, releases their GPUs and CPU's, and potentially goes higher than $70. Others here have said they expect 2-5x depending on their execution of their objectives.

The issue for large traders may be low liquidity for this strategy on leaps. For them , they may have to outright buy shares to lock in their buy price and then slowly transition those into leaps depending on liquidity.

Insiders buy for one reason and sell for many reasons, so part of this strategy is relying on insider signals:

>Intel insiders, including CEO Pat Gelsinger, disclosed they bought a total of $2.5 million of stock of the chip giant on Monday. Some insiders made their first open-market purchases of stock, and others bought for the first time in years.

>Intel (ticker: INTC) stock has been lagging behind the broader stock market with a 3% loss for the year to date. For comparison, the S&P 500 index has risen 22% so far in 2021.


>Intel CEO Gelsinger paid $500,000 for 10,000 shares, a per-share average price of $49.94. According to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gelsinger now owns 219,750 shares. It’s Gelsinger’s first open-market purchase of Intel stock since he became CEO in February.

>Director James J. Goetz led the buying, paying $1 million for 20,000 Intel shares, an average price per share of $49.76. A partner of venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, and an Intel director since 2019, Goetz now owns 198,521 Intel shares. This is his first open-market purchase of Intel stock since November 2019 when he bought $5 million of shares.

>Longtime director Frank Yeary paid $500,000 for 10,000 Intel shares, a per-share average price of $49.66. A managing member at private investment firm Darwin Capital Advisors LLC, Yeary made the purchase through a family trust that now owns 57,998 shares. Yeary also owns another 810 Intel shares in a personal account. This is Yeary’s first open-market purchase of Intel stock since October 2010 when he bought $290,000 of shares.

For more than a year now, the release of Intel's reports has been accompanied by strange stock dynamics. Usually the statements come out either at or above analysts' expectations, but the subsequent dynamics of the quotes can throw any investor out of balance.

Since July 2020, the stock has fallen from the reporting date to the low point in the next 6 trading days ranging from -22% to -6.7% and not once has the stock rallied after the reporting date.

The secret of such an anomaly lies in the speeches of Intel CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger on the release of the quarterly reports.

qaqux8_IBM,IBM,Tego Cyber Inc. Announces Commercial Launch of Threat Intelligence Platform," 

Tego Cyber Inc. (OTCQB:TGCB), an emerging developer of proactive cyber threat intelligence applications and solutions, today announced it has commercially launched the first version of its threat intelligence platform integration app: Tego Guardian. The first version of the Tego Guardian app integrates with the widely used Splunk SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. Splunk is the leading SIEM provider trusted by 92 of the Fortune 100. The Tego Guardian app is now available for direct download by Splunk users through Splunk's app store: **splunkbase -** an online community marketplace where users can interact and download apps and add-ons designed to enhance their existing Splunk environment.

""We are thrilled to commercially launch the first version of our threat intelligence platform,"" stated Shannon Wilkinson, CEO of Tego Cyber Inc. ""We went from a concept to commercialization in less than two years, including successful pilot and beta testing. The response has been extremely favorable given the unique insight we can provide global organizations to predict and prevent threats. Our application has been designed to specifically address the void that current applications are not fulfilling, thereby adding significant value to existing security platforms. We are excited to now enter the revenue phase of our business model and I would like to thank all the members of the Tego Cyber Inc. team for an exceptional job in helping us reach this major inflection point.""

What makes Tego Guardian different from other threat intelligence platforms that are currently available is that it provides cybersecurity teams with data enrichment: a detailed ‘who, what, when and where' of any potential threat. Other similar applications often identify that something is ‘bad' but do not provide any additional context, so it is up to the enterprise's cybersecurity team to analyze the threat data to establish which threats need to be acted upon. Tego Guardian automates this process saving time and money. The Tego Guardian dashboards quickly allow a cybersecurity team to see what threats have been detected within an environment, the categorization of the threat, and which assets within the environment have been affected by the threat.

Tego Cyber will generate revenue by licensing Tego Guardian. When a user downloads the app from **splunkbase**, it will seamlessly integrate into their existing Splunk SIEM platform. Once a client has downloaded and installed Tego Guardian they will be required to pay an annual license fee to activate the full version.

The initial sales strategy will focus on Splunk's existing client base. Tego Cyber will go to market through a dedicated inside sales team and working with strategic channel partners. The inside sales team will be specifically trained to market Tego Guardian to the Fortune 2000 enterprises using the Splunk SIEM platform. Tego Cyber is already in talks with a number of potential channel partners and resellers. Tego Cyber will also actively engage the Splunk online community to spread the word about the uniqueness of the product.

Tego Cyber plans to develop future versions of the Tego Guardian app for integration with other leading SIEM platforms including: Elastic, Devo, IBM QRadar, AT&T Cybersecurity, Exabeam and Google Chronical. The goal is to have a version of the Tego Guardian available for integration with the top 10 SIEM platforms within the next two years.

**About Tego Cyber Inc.**

Tego Cyber Inc. (OTCQB:TGCB) (""the Company"") was created to capitalize on the emerging cyber threat intelligence market. The Company has developed a cyber threat intelligence application that integrates with top end security platforms to gather, analyze, then proactively identify threats to an enterprise network. The Tego Guardian Threat Intelligence Platform takes in vetted and curated threat data and after utilizing a proprietary process, the platform compiles, analyzes, and then delivers that data to an enterprise network in a format that is timely, informative, and relevant. The threat data provides additional context including specific details needed to identify and counteract threats so that security teams can spend less time searching for disparate information. The first version of the application will integrate with the widely accepted Splunk SIEM to provide real-time threat intelligence to macro enterprises using the Splunk architecture. The Company plans on developing future versions of Tego Guardian for integration with other established SIEM systems and platforms including: Elastic, Devo, IBM QRadar, AT&T Cybersecurity, Exabeam, and Google Chronical.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we’ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I’m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don’t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that’s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

- **Airline stocks aren’t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren’t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I’m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they’ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we’ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we’re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we’ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won’t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

**Conclusion**

	 CEO Patrick Gelsinger has been making some big moves these past couple of months. Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. 

	Intel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.

	Moore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.

	The U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.

	The global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.

Sure, it may take a year or more (barring a miracle), but we've seen AMD give Intel a run for its money before (though never to *this* degree), and Intel managed to recover. Plus, the current CEO looks like a huge upgrade over the last guy; not only is he an engineer, but he'd been with the company during their rise and heyday.

Since Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded the company in 1968, Intel has grown to become the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue. The name comes from a contraction of “*Int*egrated *El*ectronics”. The company was the first to develop S/DRAM memory chips, and these represented most of its business in the early years.

Through the 1990s, the company invested heavily in microprocessor design and helped to drive the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Regrettably, for punters late to the party in ‘99/’00, investors had already bid the stock price up exponentially in the tech bubble. These late punters paid the price during the ensuing collapse and period of price stagnation.

[Investors bid up Intel’s shares and then wiped them out through the tech bubble.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5699c62-f84c-4eb1-8df8-7568c261a101_2400x1164.png)

After the tech bubble collapsed, growth in demand for microprocessors began to slow, and Intel’s competitors (most notably AMD) began to etch away at their previously dominant market share. An attempt by then CEO Craig Barrett to diversify the company’s business beyond semiconductors fell flat, and revenues stagnated for a few years.

[Over the long term, Intel has continued to grow. The stock price is still below where it was during the height of the tech bubble, even though revenues and EBIT are almost double what they were then.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0b7fd4c-5bd0-4f8e-8b84-2a53219ab442_3600x1747.png)

Then, in 2005, Paul Otellini, then CEO, re-focused the company on their core processor and chipset business and signed a deal with Apple to provide the processors for Macintosh computers - a big win for Intel. Over the following 15 years, successful iterative improvements of the company’s technology and the continued rapid growth of Apple helped Intel grow.

Intel is a mature company with a dominant position, long-term stable margins, and slow structural growth.

**The Story**

*This mature semiconductor business has lost the Apple contract. After a substantial short-term hit, they will continue growing slowly and steadily, while their leading position and manufacturing capabilities will help them defend margins.*

**Growth:** Intel has had an average CAGR of 5.7% since the mid-2000s. This growth has been broadly in line with market growth over this time and shouldn’t be a surprise given Intel’s dominant position, size and success of Apple products.

However, looking forward, given that Apple announced it is transitioning away from Intel processors to in-house ones, we think this will deliver an immediate hit to revenues. Analyst consensus is for an FY21 loss of revenue of 6.7%, and we believe this is about right.

Further, economists estimate that the global client computing market and cloud data centre markets will grow at 0.1% and 19.0% CAGR, respectively, over the medium term. Based on Intel’s segment weightings, this suggests ongoing medium-term market growth of 5.8%. Given the loss of the Apple contract and the fact that Intel has fallen behind on manufacturing, we think that medium-term growth is likely to be closer to the company’s fundamental growth rate of 2.45%.

**Margins:** Intel has had an average R&D adjusted operating margin of 28.68% over the last ten years. This margin is far above the industry (weighted by segment) average of 14.62% over that time. Over the TTM, the company’s margin was 29.91%.

Intel’s leading position in the microprocessor has helped them scale up and defend margins. The enormous R&D and capital investment required to extend manufacturing processes and capacity for new products act as a consistent call on capital. They have helped act as significant barriers to entry. Intel is now one of a handful of remaining semiconductor companies with the capacity to manufacture chips internally.

Given this position, we expect Intel to maintain its current average margins by either pushing higher costs through to customers or improving manufacturing processes.

**Net Reinvestment:** We expect Intel to remain an extremely capital intensive business (generating $0.61 of revenue per dollar of invested capital), especially compared to the industry ($1.71 of revenue per dollar of invested capital). Moreover, we expect their extraordinary R&D requirements, which have averaged $13.5B p.a. over the last five years, will not diminish.

**FCF:** But, given how profitable the business is, we expect it to remain highly FCF generative.

**Cost of Capital:** Intel is a semiconductor and electronics business (66.2%) and a cloud services business (33.8%) serving China (26%), Singapore (22.9%), the United States (21.3%), Taiwan (14.9%) and other international markets (14.9%).

The company has a 0.2x average operating leverage ratio and a 15.7% D/E ratio. Moody’s has assigned Intel an A1 credit rating, which is the same as our long-term synthetic rating but lower than our short-term rating of Aaa. We’ve gone with the former because we agree with Moody’s reasoning:

>“Despite Intel's strong credit metrics, the rating is constrained by the relatively high operating and technology risk associated with leading-edge semiconductor design and manufacturing, and the volatility inherent to the semiconductor sector.”  
— Moody’s Investors Services, 21 Sep 2020

Moreover, the A1 rating drives the low (1.08%) chance of distress.

**Other Assets & Minority Claims:** Intel has $17M worth (at book) of investments carried under the equity method, $6.8B of investments held at fair value, and no minority claims outstanding.

**Debts & Other Claims:** Finally, the company owes $35.6B NPV in debts and leases.

ocxd6p_INTC,INTC,Intel Corporation $INTC - A Valuation on 3rd July 2021,,2021-07-03,10,4
oac3ox_INTC,INTC,Intel Corp. (INTC) is undervalued,"I have only posted twice on this subreddit so I’m still learning to make DD posts.

I have been an Intel bull for a while, I have built computers and studied computer tech since I was in middle school so I understand Intel and it’s products.

Intel’s share price has had a bumpy ride over the past couple years, mostly trading sideways, and giving up gains very soon after achieving them. Intel as a business has had very poor management as intel for a long time has essentially been complacent in its innovation because of lack of competition. Intel only 5 years ago was far ahead of where AMD was (AMD being its most well recognized competitor) this has changed now that AMD has been able to outsource its chip manufacturing to TSMC, which is a Taiwan semiconductor company that produces the smallest chip and most dense chip designs that are available. This partnership has allowed AMD to eat away and Intel’s market share over the past 2-3 years, but there are many overlooked reasons for why Intel should still be considered a boof value buy.

Intel is it’s own manufacturer. Intel is not like AMD as intel has its own fab factories meaning they don’t have to outsource there products to other companies. This will be huge for intel as the chip trade war heats up, Intel will likely receive large subsidies from the US government as Intel is the only US based chip manufacturing company.

Intel is expanding into new markets.
Intel has as of this year expanded into graphics processing. A market that was completely dominated by Nvidia for decades. This is a very good and logical expansion of intel’s market. Intel is also partnering with other companies to try to create new processing technologies. Intel has also announced all new fab factories that will be completed by 2023.

Intel has had a refocus and has gotten new leadership. Intel has a new ceo (Patrick Gelsinger) Gelsinger has done a fantastic job refocusing the company on innovation, and if AMD is any example of how changing leadership can rejuvenate a company, then this should be great for intel’s projected growth, as AMD’s ceo (Lisa Su) has saved AMD since she has started working as there chief executive.

Intel is in a exponentially growing market. The chip industry is a very high growth sector. This has helped intel as its lack of innovation has been offset by its sale performance the past few years. Investors just need reason to believe intel will grow with its completion in order to feel confident in the company as an investment.

My last point is that Intel is fundamentally undervalued. The other chip companies in the industry have average P/E ratios around 35~40 intel, however, has a P/E ratio of 12. This ties into my previous point that investors just need reason to believe in intel’s long term growth, and once they have it intel will likely skyrocket. Intel also has the greatest market cap out of its competitors and has the lowest price to book value and not to mention billions in free cash flow. Intel is also a high dividend stock with a dividend of 2.48. while AMD offers no dividends.

I will edit this post as I find more information that I didn’t cover.

npytvv_INTC,INTC,Why Intel ($INTC) is Undervalued,"**Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued**

This is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated.

DISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing.

Intel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it’s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it’s high and has potential to go back up.

**Finances**

First things first, let’s get into Intel’s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:

2017: 62.76B

2018: 70.85B

2019: 71.97B

2020: 77.87B

Intel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:

In 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.

In 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.

In 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.

In March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.

**Competition/Growth Potential**

Intel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it’s stock price high of \~$68 in April at \~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth.

Intel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel’s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota.

**Final Thoughts**

Intel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.

Intel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market.

What are everyone else’s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?

With that said, I'd like to get peoples opinions on the pros and cons of each of these companies. 

What products do they offer?

How is one better than the other?

Will the function/price ratios of their product be cyclic or will there be a clear winner?

Just to bring up a few.

Here is some quick information on these companies:

**NVDA**: Company focuses on GPUs. Has a great GPU for both gaming and crypto. GPUs thrive in crypto and Neural Networks (AI).

MC\~350B, EV/EBITDA\~60, low debt, good growth

**AMD:** Has made a huge push in the CPU niche and has gained popularity with the gamers. Their CPUs are valued at the best function/price ratio. Pretty sure they are working on a promising GPU.

MC\~90B, EV/EBITDA\~40, low debt, good growth

**INTC:** The most experience and clout in the industry. Look around you, you'll probably see an intel sticker. Recent restructure of company with seems promising. Heavy in the DB and cloud niche which will be massive in the future (and currently is). Also, working on GPUs, not sure on the progress.

MC\~223, EV/EBITDA\~6.7, debt, could have less, good growth

&#x200B;

At first glance the cheapest to most expensive from a valuation standpoint looks as followed INTC, AMD, NVDA, respectively.

Source excerpt: IBM Unlocking a $1 trillion market: According to Spangenberg, only 2-5% of patents translate into $180 billion of value in the market. However, traditional patents are “notoriously difficult to manage, value, and transact to be treated as a liquid asset.” In this light, NFTs represent an opportunity to make the sector much more transparent and cost-efficient, unlocking a $1 trillion—or more—market.

“The use of NFTs to represent patents will help create completely new ways to interact with IP \[intellectual property\]. This is expected to benefit not only large enterprises that have significant intellectual property, but it will bring new opportunities to small and medium enterprises and even individual IP owners,” Spangenberg explained.

As stated by the CEO of SMKG, Massimo Barone, “This is a remarkable precedent to see confirmed that the market size potential to capitalize on as we move forward. Until now, the Patent market size was immeasurable or valuation target not clearly distinguishable, but thanks to Enterprise companies like IBM setting the Token Patent market size at $1Trillion plus. At SMKG, we are now able to quantify our investments into developing and IP strategy for our targets and showcase to investors and stakeholders our internal expert opinions on the true valuation of our proprietary portfolio of 16 Fintech and PayTech applications. This benchmark by IBM allows us to showcase that 3 of our blockchain and tokenizing solutions have a potential market target opportunity in a 1 Trillion USD market. We were already excited in working in collaboration with several partners on tokenizing patents and registered formulas with our two platforms, and preparing the offering potential on listed crypto exchanges. We know with this current market validation by IBM to publicly disclose a market value potential to global markets set us way ahead of the market with future ready solutions to accelerate our offerings with clients.

“At SMKG, we thrive on demonstrating facts and statistics to develop valuation models to benchmark the potential market size opportunities for each of our 16 marketplace technologies. It happens in many cases where we develop a technology with little discoverable valuation for market size and growth which makes it difficult for investors or stakeholders to truly comprehend what we are establishing as we build the IP future of SMKG in Fintech, Retail and Workforce management by enabling payments and blockchain tokenization.""

mwim6v_INTC,INTC,I plan on capitalizing on INTC PUTs tomorrow morning by buying LOW and selling the same PUT at a HIGH price.,"I see that one stock [that has decreased a lot in value during after-hours trading is INTC.](https://marketchameleon.com/Reports/AfterHoursTrading) I'm focused on this stock even though there are many other stocks that have declined even more. I'm focusing on this because it's a very large company with a very liquid options market. 

Anyways, [we see that INTC has decreased 2.24% in after-hours trading today thus far.](https://imgur.com/glwIhhD) 

I want to capitalize on the ""overshoot"" associated with the options prices here. I plan on:

* selling an option for $2.70 with SP=$60 and expiration June 18th. 
* I also want to BUY the same put for $2.20 with SP=$60 and expiration June 18th. 

There's a slim chance that one or both aspects of my transactions would get exercised. 

**Regarding why I'm selling an option for $2.70 is because I've developed a very good math model that predicts that when the cost of INTC is $61.25, that the underlying PUT should be $2.55. My model has an R^2 = 0.94 . So I'd be selling for a price slightly higher than my model suggests due to the increased volatility and the increased number of traders. I plan on buying this same PUT contract in a few days when the price has stabilized and the volatility is back down.**

**Regarding my idea to buy a PUT for $2.20: INTC closed at $62.57 yesterday at 4:00 PM EDT, and the PUT was priced at $2.14. I'm hoping to buy this PUT before the price adjusts to the $61.25 price that it's fallen to over-night.

mwf7m1_MSFT,MSFT,MicroStrategy stock is an intelligent trailing stop-loss on BTC,"MSTR DD. Not Advice. Originally posted in r/stocks but they told me to come here :p

As many know (but few talk about) Michael Saylor, CEO of business analytics firm MicroStrategy ($MSTR), **privately** bought over $250 million in bitcoin with his own money **before** he started using the **public** company’s money to buy bitcoin...Historically he claimed Bitcoin was doomed to fail until one day he realized that he could **legally** put a bunch of his **personal** wealth into Bitcoin, and then convince his company (of which he owns \~23%) that it should use treasury funds to buy bitcoin, thereby pumping up the price. Now, he just has to go to all his executive friends with controlling interests in other companies and convince them to do the same thing (i.e. use personal funds to buy BTC, then use their companies funds), thereby sending the price higher until there are no more companies who do not own bitcoin. He has already convinced Elon to use Tesla treasury funds to buy $1.5 billion BTC (although, I am unaware of Elon using personal assets to buy BTC). 

Why does this make MSTR the buy of a lifetime?

When other executives wise up to this scheme to simultaneously multiply their personal wealth **and** potentially the wealth of their companies, Bitcoin holders, and more specifically MicroStrategy, will share in that multiplication. Eventually when there are no more companies willing to buy into BTC, Saylor's army of data scientist and blockchain experts will hopefully have warned MSTR that it is time to sell before the masses begin to sell. MicroStrategy will begin to sell behind the scenes and then disclose the sale **after** they have already sold. Meaning that after they’re done selling, I personally think it will mark the beginning of the decline (although it may not tank immediately). Saylor will not sell until he feels he can no longer convince anyone else to buy significant amounts. I believe it will be a more gradual decline as the price will be temporarily sustained by retail investors - which is why I prefer MicroStrategy stock to BTC itself. **MicroStrategy is an intelligent trailing stop-loss on a BTC bubble**. If we assume the price of BTC drops after MicroStrategy sells it’s 70k+ hoard, the $MSTR share price will remain intact - because they now have fiat currency and are no longer valued by the price of BTC. Yes, there are other ways to invest in BTC such as Grayscale… but Grayscale will not sell at the peak, because its an ETF. You could buy BTC itself, but then when MSTR unloads its BTC haul, you risk missing the peak as an uneducated small fish. 

While to many this may seem like a pyramid scheme (it basically is), it is not a typical pyramid scheme. In a typical pyramid scheme, each person only benefits when the next person buys into it. In the case of BTC, each person can play the role of **both the initial investor as well as the next investor;** at the same time, the initial investor (personal money) won’t necessarily suffer the losses of the next investor (corporate money), should the next investor be the final investor.

It is really a rare scenario where everyone can multiply their personal wealth without taking on any significant personal risk. Sure, if an executive is the last one to the party, he/she won’t really see that much gain, but as they’ll be doing a second buy with company money, it’s unlikely that they will lose money – assuming the price only goes up when the next person/company buys. All things equal, if an executive buys BTC with the expectation that his/her company will buy BTC with treasury funds, one of two things can happen:

\#1 they are successful in convincing the company to buy BTC, bringing the price up. 

\#2 They fail at convincing their company to buy BTC, which means the price stays where it is – UNTIL the next team of executives decides to invest their own money into BTC (price goes up) and their company’s money (price goes up more).

Tell me about $MSTR’s core business.

Although the value of MicroStrategy’s BTC has now eclipsed the value of their core business, their core business is still quite strong. In the past year, they have made significant improvements to their otherwise outdated analytics platform and are just beginning to see the rewards. In terms of product quality and feature set, their 2021 platform is a close third to Tableau ($CRM) and Power BI ($MSFT). They have beaten expectations in the past few quarters and have seen increasing revenues. They are coming out of a period of deep investment in their product and sales efforts which are beginning to pay off.

What are the risks?

Because of the strength and relative size of the core business, the biggest risk is that the price of BTC could drop on it’s own, before MSTR is able to sell… However, I find this unlikely. It would take quite a lot of selling at this point to drop the price significantly, and treasuries typically move quite slow. In other words, Tesla does not have a guy sitting around waiting to sell $1.5 billion of BTC if it drops 10% today. Treasury funds usually require a lot of discussion before any moves are made, including sales. They’re much more likely to sell because they need money for operations rather than selling because they’re scared. Because of this, I think the price of BTC will become much more stable than it has been in the past.

Companies rely on signals, insights, and aggregate data-points moving their respective industries and providing a more holistic 360° view of the challenges and opportunities influencing success.

The global business intelligence industry worth just $23.1 billion in 2020 is undergoing a period of rapid upheaval and is expected to swell $33.3 billion within the next 4 years. This growth is largely being driven by the perfect storm created by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and subsequent global lockdowns that have forced small, medium-sized, and enterprise business organizations to radically rethink core processes around hiring staff, securing investment, allocating resources, and setting strategies to grow market share. 

Wikiprofile is the new “Wikipedia for Business” platform by SAAS innovator Wikisoft (stock symbol WSFT) that far surpasses the free offerings of competitors like LinkedIn and Glassdoor. LinkedIn (LNKD) was acquired for $26.2 billion in 2016 by Microsoft (MSFT) at a buyout price of $196 per share and Glassdoor was snatched up for $1.2 billion two years later. 

If you are searching for a software solution to empower your business development in 2021 or a searching for a unique investment opportunity, you need to check out Wikiprofile by Wikisoft (WSFT:US).

Considering getting very far out ATM leaps (jan/june 22) for one of them and just leaving it alone until a month or two before expiry when theta starts to eat my lunch. 

From DD posted here I’ve dug out that TSM is more likely to grow than INTC, but because it’s in Taiwan, the market is hesitant to fairly value it due to potential influence if China attempts anything funny. Should be at least a trillion dollar company if it was US based. 

INTC is far from down and out as many are suggesting, and with Rocket Lake out soon it could see a breakout if they smash earnings 2nd and 3rd quarters this year.

So I’m torn which to go for.

Before anyone suggest it I’m not going for AMD, as though it has room to grow, I believe it’s the TSLA of the processor industry. Crazy bubble, but those who can stomach the insane P/E have made mad gains. Not for me unfortunately.",2021-02-27,1,21

Last week they announced they’re developing a global DeFi bank called “Kash” to bring mainstream financial products to blockchain (savings, real estate, payments etc etc)

Today they secured a $375,000 investment through a private offering at $.15 per shares with warrants at $.45 per share (to me that sounds like they’re expecting their stock to keep growing)

l63y49_INTC,INTC,Microsoft (MSFT) vs Intel (INTC)," We constantly compare stocks in similar sectors. Below an extract of our comparison between Microsoft and Intel

&#x200B;

One of our key metrics is the Price to Stockholders equity per share ratio. When looking at this we find the following:

* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Microsoft: 13.5
* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Intel Corp : 2.8

Based on this metric Intel Corp offers far more value than Microsoft. Most firms tend to trade at a ratio of between 2 and 5 times. While Intel trades within this range the stock if Microsoft is trading well outside this expected range. So what is the stockholders equity per share you ask? Well if a firm sells all assets, pays all its debts and distributes the rest to its stockholders, the stockholders equity per share shows what each stockholders will get. Thus the higher this ratio the less you will get out per stock compared to what you are paying for it. So Microsofit that is trading at 13.5 times it stockholders equity you will only get 7.5% of its current stock price out of they were to sell all assets, pay all debt and distribute the rest to stockholders. In the case of Intel you would get out 35.7% of its current stock price  


Next up cash as percentage of stock price:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 0.81%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 2.6%

Next up lets take a look at the percentage cash on the balance sheet makes up of each group's total assets:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 4.7%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 3.8%

Looking at the cash position of the three firms Microsoft has the strongest cash position (as a percentage of their total assets). The cash per share gives an indication of if investors were to buy the stock now, how much of that stock price is made up by cash on their balance sheet. In this case its Intel that comes out on top with 2.6% of their current stock price being made up by cash.   


Next the overused but still useful metric, the Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):

* PE for Microsoft:29
* PE for Intel Corp : 9.8

So  Intel has the lower PE ratio of the two firms looked at in this comparison  


Price/Stock Valuation ratio:

* Price/Stock Valuation for Microsoft: 1.27
* Price/Stock Valuation for Intel Corp : 0.76

Based on the Price/Stock valuation metric it is Intel that comes out as the winner as its trading at well below our stock price target while Microsoft is trading at well above our stock valuation for it.  


If we have to chose one of these two tech giants, based on their stock price performance, their financial results and other financial ratios we rate the stock of Intel as the **winner**.",2021-01-27,0,18

jhyimp_INTC,INTC,Bullish Ideas for Intel (again),"In case you missed it (and you didn't, you astute watcher of markets), INTC got knocked down again after earnings, just like last quarter.  So, just like in September when  I suggested [bullish option trades](https://optionsalary.com/cheap-chips) in Intel (Ticker: INTC) I'm doing it again.  Obligatory chart:

&#x200B;

[6 month chart of INTC](https://preview.redd.it/gtz5tt26cav51.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2c90a075d6b92d0d95e4553dfde4ce5b179066)

After last earnings cycle's drop, Intel basically stabilized and then climbed back, recovering a portion of the post-earnings loss.  We've again seen Intel meet or beat on its top line revenue as well as earnings per share.  The Data Center Group did come up a bit short on expected revenue and some point to that as the reason for the significant decline.  See all of the earnings details directly on Intel's [site](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1424/intel-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results). 

#### Trade Ideas

With the stock now back at levels similar to last earnings release, here are a few bullish Intel option trades for playing a recovery in the name:

* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45 put for 0.48 **or**
* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45/40 put spread for 0.40 **or**
* Hold tight until after the election and re-evaluate
* Prices are at the midpoint as of 10/23/2020
* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.

Selling the puts outright would result in owning shares at an equivalent of $44.52 if INTC ends below 45 on the 13th.  The immediate return if the put expires worthless is 1.1% or almost 19.5% annualized as this is a 3 week trade.

The put spreads cap our downside risk in exchange for just 0.08 and also limits margin.  If the spread expires worthless, it will be a return of 8.7% on the $460 risked per trade ($40/$460).  

The 45 strike is outside of the expected move between now and November 13th.

Personally, I've put on a ""half"" position and will look to put on more after the election.  I also added a few shares.

#### What's the downside?

Earnings Just occurred and there may be some lingering volatility in the name.  Combined with the election, another approach is to simply wait a week and a half and then re-evaluate.  Another approach is to put on half the size now and wait until after the election to put on the other half.  

Margins are down at INTC vs. one year ago and AMD is a 'flashier' name.  For put sales, I prefer the larger (INTC sells about 10x as much as AMD), slower moving INTC and its dividend in the near term, particularly now that it has gone ""on sale"".  I have and will continue to trade in and out of AMD.

Intel's valuation is well below its 5 year averages and it continues to grow revenue and profits.  Now is (still) a reasonable time to try and pick up shares or at least profit from its currently depressed price.",2020-10-25,157,79

[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/INTC\/SssvzRTE-Options-Idea-Buy-The-Jan-21-2022-INTC-40-0-Call-13-90\/](https://preview.redd.it/zafjaiy26kk51.png?width=2662&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0cbab1e05f9e4c3535930fe7f9019ef68e959f8)

Intel just gapped down after its last earnings release as margins tightened from almost 60% last year to 53.3%. Trouble lies ahead as well since Intel’s 7-nanometer manufacturing is delayed which will give AMD a 6 month head start to eat away at Intel’s market share. Intel has responded by initiating a huge $10 billion stock repurchase program. This is in addition to the Oct 2019 repurchase program already in place, bring total repurchases to around $20 billion.

Even though Intel is in trouble, we think there’s an opportunity for a longer-term play. Observe the historic Price/Sales ratio for Intel in the weekly view. We are buying today at 2.75. We’ve marked entries over the last few years at the 2.75 PS level. Every entry would have been successful over a 1 year holding period. The 50 week average on the PS ratio for Intel is 3.32.

Nevertheless, we like to reduce risk with options, so we are not going long in Intel. We are buying a deep in the money LEAP call on Intel today at $13.90, which gives us unlimited profit potential above $53.90 and limits our losses below $40.

Since this is such a long term LEAP call, we have 16 months (or 72 weeks) to sell monthly or weekly calls against this position. So while our current breakeven point is $53.90, we intend to lower our cost basis through the sale of out of the money shorter term calls.

This is strategy is called the poor man’s covered call. The important point is that with a $53.90 breakeven, the lowest priced call we can sell is $54. If we sell a lower priced call and INTC were to rise too quickly, the trade could lose money.

Selling next month or next week 15 delta out of the money calls should produce more than enough income to compensate us for the loss of dividends on this position and reduce our cost basis below $51, which is where Intel was trading today when we opened our long position.

Our objectives for short call income generation against this position are as follows:

* Initial Objective: $2.90 (Extrinsic Option Premium)
* Secondary Objective: $4.55 (5 Quarters Dividends on 100 shares)
* Stretch Objective: $13.90 (100% of capital recovered)

If we complete our initial objective we’ll have recovered our extrinsic option premium, giving us the benefit of going long in INTC at no additional cost. If we complete the secondary objective we’ll have not only recovered the option premium, but also generated 5 quarters of INTC’s $0.33 dividend, making our position equal to a long position in Intel, but at 20% of the capital outlay. And our final stretch objective is to recover $13.90 over the life of this call, recovering our capital early.

**Standard Exit**: Exit the trade for a profit when INTC reaches a PS ratio of 4.

**Early Exit**: We exit the trade as soon as the PS ratio on INTC has recovered the 50-week moving average.

iaxcbd_INTC,INTC,Trade Idea of the Week - 8/17/2020 - Selling Put (Spread) in INTC,"Betcha can't eat just one.  No really, don't eat Intel's chips.  They are terrible.  Worse than this joke.  Back on July 23rd, Intel reported earnings.  They beat Wall Street's estimate by $0.12 ($1.23 vs. $1.11).  They beat on revenue as well ($19.7B vs $18.55B).  Earnings, revenue, net income, etc. all grew nicely from Q2 2020.  Intel even provided full year guidance for 2020, again beating Wall Street's estimates. As you'd expect when a stock beats on all fronts AND provides healthy guidance the stock took off ... 

 

[6 Month Chart of INTC](https://preview.redd.it/8y7iqg7ooeh51.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=f435f83d71f8d3f42396b6ef53fe4fe134cd9337)

That chart isn't upside down, INTC dropped hard after earnings and then fell a bit more.  This, by the way, is a great example of why I don't place directional bets going into earnings!

With the stock suddenly a lot cheaper and it has stabilized a bit, we'll look at a trade that assumes it doesn't drop again in the near term: 

* 8/28/2020 expiration, sell the 47.5 put for 0.52 **or**
* 8/28/2020 expiration, sell the 47.5/45 put spread for 0.41 **or**
* 8/28/2020 expiration, sell the 46.5/45 put spread for 0.20
* Prices are at the midpoint as of 8/14/2020
* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.

Selling the puts outright would result in owning shares at an equivalent of $46.98 if INTC ends below 47.50 on the 28th.  The immediate return if the put expires worthless is 1.1% or almost 29% annualized as this is a 2 week trade.

The put spreads cap our downside risk in exchange for just 0.11.  If the spread expires worthless, it will be a return of 19.6% on the $209 risked per trade ($41/$209). 

To be very clear, this is not a low risk trade.  The market is pricing in about a $2.3 move between now and the end of next week.  The put and first put spread fall well into that range.  If you sell the put, you should be prepared to take delivery of the shares.  The strike is set below the low close on 7/31, but nothing says INTC can't go below that value (just go back to March...).  I'm OK with adding shares at this level and prefer the higher premium vs. selling a lower strike put.  

For a higher probability put spread, one could look at the 46.5/45 put spread for 0.20.  A lot less premium, but also less capital at risk, giving us a decent return if it expires worthless of 15.3% ($20/$130).  The short strike of this spread is just outside of the expected move between now and expiration.

**But what about AMD?**

The beginning of this post includes the good news for INTC - the earnings highlight reel if you will.  There are issues.  Gross margin was down significantly from almost 60% to 53.3%.  The other was the news that their latest chips would be delayed by about 6 months.  Their main rival, AMD (Ticker: AMD) has already started selling 7-nanometer chips, which means they'll have the market to themselves for even longer until INTC launches their chips.   Have you ever considered the distance ('pitch') between adjacent transistors in a chip?  If not, maybe this isn't really as big deal.  Also important, this news is priced into the stock now and there are no earnings or significant news expected on INTC during the duration of the trade.

AMD is taking market share from INTC and they have room to grow with less than 20% of the desktop share. Take a look at an AMD chart and you'll see the market is encouraged as well.  I think AMD is a bit extended currently, but I wouldn't be surprised if I suggested trades in AMD in the future...

Intel's valuation is well below its 5 year averages and it continues to grow revenue and profits.  It will figure out 7nm and in the meantime, now is a reasonable time to try and pick up shares or at least profit from its currently depressed price.",2020-08-16,5,9

hyvmjr_INTC,INTC,INTC - 2022 Leap Calls.,"What are your guys opinions on INTC leap calls. Intel is suspected to develop their 7 NM chips within 6 months. Although AMD is surging, I expect Intel to trade upwards within the next two years. This is based on the profitability of the company. I do understand the bearish opinion regarding this stock as well, especially with Apple developing their own chips. However, I think Intel is in a current price territory that can necessitate an upwards movement. 

I like the January 21st, 65 strike price 2022 call. Currently priced around 2.88. Do you guys think the implied volatility is low enough to go for a Leap this far out?

hxfhgt_INTC,INTC,Best Way for INTC to Move Higher,"After this fiasco of an ER and 7nm delay announcement, Intc received 9 downgrades with multiple sell ratings. 

This stock feels like BA, GE, IBM, WFC  - a titan that has lost its way. 

I am curious what is the best and fastest way for the stock to regain momentum? If you say execute on chip production, then that’s at least 2-3 years before we know if they are back on course. Their history with the 10nm delays gives no one any faith that they will be able to right the ship after their announced 6 month delay. If anything, analysts fear the delay will get extended again and again. Listen to the conference call. 

So how does INTC right the stock quickly?

I see these options from other titans ....

1) fire CEO and the VPs responsible for delays

2) increase dividends

3) increase share buyback 

4) announce transparency initiative- yields , roadmap , etc. 

5) add directors that will hold execs accountable. 


6 months ago, the 7nm was coming along great. Now, it’s delayed. The market doesn’t believe in Intc anymore. Any positive news they come out from now till 2023 (new 7nm launch) will not be believed.",2020-07-25,1,25
hx0ezj_INTC,INTC,Intel ($INTC) on track to go back to March lows today (-14% pre-market),"Intel shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world’s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated.

At issue is a new method for cranking out smaller, more powerful chips, the timing of which “is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations”.

Intel’s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That’s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors.

Competitive pressure has been building on Intel in recent years. The company designs and manufacturers its own processors, while many rivals focus on design and tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make their chips. That’s helped TSMC improve production faster than Intel, and given companies such as AMD a new chance to compete.

With this mornings’ pre-market currently indicating opening at $52 (-14%), I’m torn on what to do with Intel.  I’ve been invested in $INTC since Feb 2018, and got in around $45.

&#x200B;

**AMD – Advanced Micro Devices**

AMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There’s been an uptick in the semi’s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.

**DKNG – DraftKings**

Draftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.

**KO – Coca Cola**

Big call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn’t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.

**INTC – Intel Corporation**

I caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It’s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.

**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**

Didn’t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven’t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We’ll find out this week.

I was thinking of shorting ATM put on AMD while shorting ATM calls on NVDA and INTC with an egal weight between bullish and bearish plays. 60 or 90 days to maturity (profit from decay in volatility). 

Problem is, it would really be bad would there be any crash or spike (think black swan event or resolution of the trade war).

Normally I wouldn't go for suggestions, but since this is relatively advanced compared to manually choosing a long call, I thought'd I'd try what they suggest for now till I get a good grasp of it. Anyways, my question. So there's a few different options, which I want to try and I link them here. I'm curious why having a larger range with higher max loss is more risky then a smaller range with lesser max loss (according to Robinhood). Like a range of +/- 4 percent seems like a safer bet to me than a +/- 1 percent. Thanks!

I know I am but I go here a good amount to learn how to be a better investor. I had my hopes up about the reading group one user was going to do with The Intelligent Investor and it didn't come to fruition. Which is sad because the minds on this sub are incredible but a lot of the threads that come up here are littered with answers related to ""Vanguard index funds"", ""ETFs"", and I'm so fucking happy we're not seeing a lot of cryptocurrency posts anymore but that was a big one also. 

Investing, as far as my schmuck mind has gathered, is way more than just dropping money in index funds and ETFs and funds of various other goals. It, much to the chagrin of a lot of the people who do respond with the aforementioned responses such as ""Vanguard"", ETF, etc., includes picking individual stocks. Rallying around passive investing is good, yes, but let's be real for a good minute here: Are we going to listen? If anything some of you readers might be holding blue-chip stocks. Which is fine, but I want to know WHY you own them and have the ensuing discussion revolved around investing methods. So we can all learn why you picked this, hopefully not just because it's a blue-chip stock, but because there's a concise valuation you found within reading about the company that led you to believe your money would be best suited going to that company.

Let's create discussion around various methods of investing, picking out current and past investors and analyzing their methods, reading groups. I know I'm only getting started with this investing journey but my god its my money and I want to take it more fucking seriously than ""Vanguard"", ""ETFs"", ""buy and hold"", ""bitcoin"", and simplistic answers.

I mean, the problem is hardware related, which cannot be fixed for good until hardware is replaced. I just imagine we will now see below scenario repeat:

1)Intel releases software update
2)Someone finds a way to bypass it and makes system vulnerable again
3)Intel releases software update

Now reports are saying 2-30% performance degradation, which sounds pretty bad. However some users are reporting ""only"" around 5-10% drop, with (linux) servers taking the brute of the performance degradation. 

With all this being said, have fundamentals in Intel changed? Will this affect sales for servers/institutions and retail?

>""There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can’t do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn’t care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophically enough as “part of the game.” Everybody swears off such inexcusable extravagances—until next time.""

However.

Intel failed to deliver 5G modems before Qualcomm which they had a huge push for. Currently it seems unclear who the leader of 5G will be, but many suspect it will be Qualcomm. 
Personally I also believe Intel is backed into the PC market corner and is spreading itself very thin to try and branch out into other markets. They have no clear focus that I can see for their many side projects other than 5G which may not pan out. They do however have an impressive storage technology called 3D storage, but they will have competition and their name isn't huge in storage.


Qualcomm has a promising future even outside of 5G, though it is extremely likely they will be the dominators of 5G in my opinion. Qualcomm will likely be found in many or higher end smart devices and will continue to be in phones almost definitely. However if they do lose 5G it may be a significant blow to them.
What I'm worried about with QCOM right now, is they are being sued by the FTC and Apple. I don't consider myself anywhere near educated enough to make any estimates of what's going to happen here and I don't know the facts. But QCOM price is dropping fast. I find it unlikely that the company couldn't come back after even both of these suits pretending they lost both. So in my mind I am hoping now is just a good time to buy, or if not now then after the verdicts.

NVDA - strong sustained performance. New architecture could lift them even more. However..it went up so much..im not sure if they will explode more.

ARMH - good future. smartphones are here to stay. i owned ARMH when they were 20$.. sold.. ..oh well

AMD - they can't stay at these levels. even though they compete with both nvda and intc..i believe that they should go up. they have some interesting architectures coming up (Zen and the 32 core chip for next year)

INTC - slowed down a bit..especially since they can;t really make a huge play in mobile ..however still a good value stock right ?

1ontmz_INTC,INTC,"Short ARMH, Long INTC...Thoughts?","So, months back, in May, I took a short position in ARMH because of it's sky high valuations.  I am very aware of what they do and how they make money.  Most of the hype surrounds the growth in the smartphone and tablet space and the cannibalization of PC sales.  As a result, Intel trades cheaply, while ARMH is very expensive.  Many people have a belief that the ARM/RISC instruction set inherently results in much better battery life than x86/CISC.  My thoughts were that the only comparison to draw was that Intel was using very old process technology to produce Clover Trail based Atom Z2000 chips and Medfield chips for Lenovo smartphones in China.  Surprisingly, despite being way late to the game, Intel offerings were pretty decent even if not the best.  The advantage is that Intel chips would have no problem running Android devices while ARM cannot say the same about Windows (RT is a joke).

So, the Intel event came and it was announced that Intel had scored a design win in the new Galaxy Tab.  ARM shares dropped as low as $36, and I had gone short at $42.  In my optimism, 1. I didn't buy any calls as a hedge and 2. I didn't cover my shorts when I had the chance, even as the price came back up to 42 when no other good Intel catalysts have shown up.

Flash forward to today, we are closing in on $50 for ARM, and I'm getting the nasty feeling that only an unhedged short can give you (LOL).  Luckily, Intel has actually been moving up along with MSFT (which I also have).  Essentially I'm offsetting my losses in ARM with my gains in Wintel.

I've been seeing a lot of news about Intel saying there will be Intel tablets as low as $99 and convertibles for $350 (http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/15/intel-says-hardware-bargains-to-multiply-this-fall-99-tablets-299-haswell-laptops-349-2-in-1-hybrids/) etc etc, and Android tablets that will dual boot full Windows 8.  I feel as though if there is any reasonable amount of sales in this space during the holiday season, we are going to see a huge drop in ARMH shares.  

Now that I've written you a novel; do you guys agree?  Should I cover before I have to start crying myself to sleep, or hold on?",2013-10-17,8,9

19let3_INTC,INTC,I think Intel (INTC) is looking like a great buy right now. ,"8 billion in cash, not much debt, 4.30% dividend, great Q4 earnings and cash flow, easily funds its R&D expenses, p/e (9.3) significantly below industry average, and bullish moving average cross of the 50 and 100 dma just occurred. Diversifying into phone and tablet markets etc. 

Seems like a great buy to me, and a 4.5% dividend is a pretty safety net.

13jflo_INTC,INTC,Intel (INTC); On sale or grim future?,"Just looking to see what other people think. 

Personally, I see it as a more of an on sale. They're going through some managerial changes which could benefit or burden the company. But with the amount of money they spend in RnD and going in to the mobile market I find it hard to count them out. In addition, people think it's detrimental that they aren't quite in tablets and phones, but I believe the more those are being used, the more intel chips will be used to power the cloud servers that everything is in.

Thinking of buying in if it keeps dipping lower around $15-17 range (I know that's quite a price discrepancy)

t1raz_INTC,INTC,Plans regarding INTC... ,"I'm currently long INTC. The original purpose of this investment was to simply beat inflation via the dividend, rather than having that money sit around in a savings account making 0.15%. 

However, I (luckily/randomly) had good timing and am currently sitting on ~10% profit in 3 months and haven't even received a dividend yet.

Historically, INTC hasn't broken 30 in the past eight years, and the company is pretty much a blue-chip (lol ""chip"") at this point. They dominate the semiconductor market though, and definitely aren't going anywhere (AMD hasn't been able to field any serious bids for processor marketshare in years). I wouldn't anticipate any crazy growth, or any reason for the market to get super excited about them.

Should I sell now (seeing as I've already hit my investment goal for at least the next three years, with commissions) and look for another good entry point? Or just stick it out and hope the price continues to rise?",2012-05-01,6,10

ocffa_INTC,INTC,Thoughts on Intel? (INTC) ,"I recently purchased my first shares, which were in INTC, the cost I paid was $24.4. Unfortunately I only invested £178 which gave me 11 shares in the company. 

I believe that Intel is going to be a star in the long run for sure. It's the biggest computer processor creator and developer with the only close competitor to be AMD which, in my opinion is not really competition. 
The only place that Intel wasn't supplying processors was for the mobile & tablet market, which they have now stepped into. So I see them being hugely profitable; nice dividend as well! 

What are your thoughts?

j1ser_INTC,INTC,Investing Advice ? [NASDAQ:INTC],"Hi all, 
I'm new to Value Investing and I'm looking to purchase INTC and would like to hear someone else's opinion. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WHzCE.png) is the historical EPS/PE/Dividends information for the last ~16 years with estimates for the next few years from Value Line. From '03 to '09 their PE was on average 20 and right now it's closer to 10.5. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8BG4X.png) is the daily technical analysis, it shows that we're right in the middle of the Bollinger band and the force index & RSI look even, meaning it's not over/under it's EMA by much.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/xKWZp.png) are my calculations on EPS growth as a function of time and expected return for each case assuming a future PE value of 12 (the picture is much better obviously if you believe that it'll get back to the ~20 that it's been for the last 6-7 years.)

So, judging by the low PE, good EPS growth, strong financials, and good outlook for them for the next 2-3 years I think it's a good investment. So, what does someone else think?

Thanks!
