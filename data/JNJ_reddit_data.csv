>

>We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

>The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

>Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.

>Global dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.

>Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.

>Historically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market’s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.

>Our Methodology

>For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.

>Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ([**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)).

>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98

>An American multinational pharmaceutical company, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds. The company has a diverse portfolio that includes over 10 high-performing drugs across multiple therapeutic areas, such as infectious diseases and oncology. In addition to its pharmaceutical business, the company is a major player in the medical device industry, providing further diversification. Its financial performance remains stable and reliable. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by nearly 15%.

>In the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported $22.5 billion in revenue, marking a 5.2% increase from the prior year. As a prominent healthcare company, it remains focused on developing treatments for diseases with substantial unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. The MedTech division recorded a 6.2% rise in global operational sales, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. Strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed supported growth in the Cardiovascular segment, while the General Surgery unit saw increased sales of wound closure products.

>Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.00%, as of February 25. The company maintains one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, spanning 62 years.

>Overall JNJ ranks 8th on our list of the dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [**cheapest AI stock**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/cheapest-ai-stock-with-10000-return-potential/).In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

I am thinking about allocating 8-10% of portfolio to JNJ for the long term. It seems if there was ever a time to start buying in, it’s now.

1hh6mrf_JNJ,JNJ,Is the market missing JNJ's true potential?,"JNJ is currently trading at $146.4 per share, with a market capitalization of $352.49 billion. But the market may be overlooking its potential.

Several valuation models indicate JNJ is priced below its intrinsic value. Estimates range from a 31.7% to a 48.8% discount. Lemme break this down:  


* **Intrinsic Value Estimate:** $192.8 per share. This is based on a conservative growth outlook.
* **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model:** $217.9 per share. This calculation uses a 6.9% discount rate and a 3.0% long-term growth rate.
* **Relative Valuation:** $167.6 per share. Even using this method, which often shows lower values than intrinsic value models, JNJ shows upside potential. 



The consistency across these different valuation methods supports the conclusion of a price below fair value.  


Now, let's look at the financial picture. JNJ's last twelve months (LTM) free cash flow (FCF) was $19.5 billion, generated on LTM revenue of $87.7 billion. Its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin is 21.1%, slightly below its five-year average of 22.4%. However, the market appears to be pricing in a -2.8% annual decline in free cash flow over the next decade. This is in contrast to JNJ's three-year average FCF growth of 4.6% and the industry average of 8.2%. This discrepancy suggests the market's outlook may be too pessimistic.  


Projections for the next ten years (2024-2034) show:  


* Revenue growth from $88.7 billion to $130.3 billion (a 4.0% CAGR).
* Operating income (EBIT) increasing from $22.1 billion to $32.4 billion.
* Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) rising from $20.9 billion to $30.6 billion (a 2.3% CAGR). 

This projected growth is steady and reflects the stability often associated with established companies like JNJ. The market-implied value of growth (MIVoG) is 27.8% of enterprise value, suggesting the market may be underestimating its future growth potential.  


Based on my projections, expected annual returns are approximately 3.1% over three years and 6.8% over five years. These returns include projected earnings growth (3.7%), shareholder yield (4.0%), and a decrease in valuation multiples (-4.6%).

JNJ has a slightly high P/E ratio, yeah, but the price-to-value gap and strong cash flow generation make it an interesting stock to watch for. Overall score: 9 of 10, according to Value Sense.

South Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity
Reuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00
April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.

The affected batches were sold in South Africa, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria, the statement added.

The recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday, which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.

Kenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup, which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

10kfq5x_JNJ,JNJ,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // JNJ LMT CVS,"**OVERALL:** A bit of a 'pause day,' at least by comparision to the moves we've seen lately.  All trading occurred (so far, 15 minutes to do) within yesterday's candle; therefore, there shouldn't be any major changes in terms of support or resistance levels.  Of note, it looks like neither the SPY nor the QQQ will officially break out of their bear channels...at least not today, unless either or both shoot up in the final minutes, I guess.  The SPY currently look the most 'at risk' of failing the breakout entire, by closing back down inside its bear channel.  QQQ looks slightly more comfortably above, bolstered by the gap-fill support level it is sitting on top of (having just filled it yesterday).

**Symbol**:  CVS  
**Add Price**:  86.25  
**Add Size**:  1%  
**New Avg**:  88.07  
**New Size**:  1%  
**Thesis**:  Price hit its next major support level, double bottom from October 2022.  My next add level is the support zone between 80.00 and 77.00 -- at which point I will look at a 1.5 - 2% tranche depending on if/how price moves to this level.  My current cost average is underneath where a technical snapback could send price to the former support TL/breakdown TL, and the positon ITM.  We will have to see how price moves to this level, as that TL is now major resistance (not to mention the 20 DMA, and the 25% Fib retrace level).  

https://preview.redd.it/qk24ubtvv1ea1.jpg?width=2312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40f24e53b56aa03097454265fb986cd9baa67baa",2023-01-24,1,1
10jp5mp_JNJ,JNJ,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // NFLX JNJ LMT UUP,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors added to the up-moves from Friday, and all are now out of the bear channel resistance.  My bias is neutral-to-positive in the coming days-to-week timeframe, basically leading into the Fed statement; I could see consolidation & 'floating up' into that speech.  From a technical perspective, there are numerous resistance levels lingering just above where the current price action is, so a little more upside into the Fed would be a good thing to see before we ultimately head lower in the weeks-to-months timeframe.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout. 

https://preview.redd.it/1vgo2gw19vda1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731f9dc22d15fbcef0d24492672ccde7858bfc37

**QQQ:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- and compared to IWM, more similar volume vs Friday's move higher.  Price must close above 290.21 before re-entering the bear channel for that descending TL to be viewed as a major support level.  Nearest resistance is 293.66 the 200 DMA, with major resistance at 296.88 pivot high.  Major support remains the  274.78 flag's top and ascending TL convergence. 

https://preview.redd.it/5gcnurzh8vda1.jpg?width=2311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=477ebaeb829c25ac16c445e4c350f01b96efbac0

**IWM**: Another solid move up; however, note the significantly less volume today vs. Friday's candle.  Another up day on even lighter volume may suggest exhaustion. Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

**Add Price**:  3.90  
**Add Size**:  0.33%  
**New Avg**:  9.23  
**New Size**: 0.9%  
**Thesis**:  Currently, this trade is -70%.  As I discussed over the weekend, I added as price filled a major gap from last April's earnings call.  I know I shouldn't; the right thing to do here is exit...but...emotions & the fact I am still under a 1% position size 'got the best of me.'    Even though I know this is the wrong thing to do, I may again add, but only a 0.1% tranche...and only if 1) price reaches over 370; 2) volume is lighter than today; and 3) options price falls sub-2.00 -- if these conditions happen, then we may see a reversal off what would be a 3-day surge on falling volume.

I entered a 0.33% position near the dollar's top and was actually up at one point +5-6% -- but then the sideways choppy trading caused the IV to plummet more quickly than I anticipatd/was paying attention.  I added another 0.33% position...but by the time I did, I needed the UUP to fall at a faster than it did.

Comparing:

I want to start this out with comparing a high yield income focused stock (GOF) against a favorite for dividend growth investors (JNJ). I want to show people just how quickly an income focused stock can compound compared to an expensive blue-chip company, and why it's so appealing to some people (There is some assuming as we can't determine JNJ's dividend increases or future stock growth).

Let's compare JNJ against my favorite US income fund GOF (via Google Finance):

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-

**Dividends:**

JNJ:  
Yield: 2.5% ($4.24)

Quarterly dividend: 1.06[Increased 5% 2021, 6.3% 2020, 5.6% 2019](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-dividend-increase-of-5-0)Increases yearly around $0.04 - $0.06

GOF:  
Yield: 10.11% ($2.19)

Monthly dividend: 0.1820[increases by 0.0001 and decrease 0.0001 but has never fallen below 0.1820](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOF/dividend/)Let's assume it stays at $0.1820 for the below example).

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Onto the simple Test (some math / Hypotheticals)

**You have $10,000 USD to invest in ether JNJ or GOF. Let's see what your results are if you held it for 5 years (You could continue this trend but the same results would still show):**

$10,000 / $170.10 (after hours as of writing this at 4:13PM) = **58.78 shares**

$10,000 / $21.65 (after hours as of writing this at 4:00PM) = **461.89 shares**

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The increases from JNJ average around [$0.05](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/jnj/dividend-history) , with a few $0.06, and a few $0.04. To make this easier to calculate lets pick the ""safer bet"" and say they increase their dividend by $0.05 on a yearly basis.

Tickers: JNJ GOF

Shares **58.78 461.89**

2021 dividends (4.24) $249.22 $1,011.53

**2022 Shares 60.24 508.61**

2022 dividends (4.29) $258.42 **(+$9.2)** $1,113.85 **(+$102.32)**

**2023 Shares 61.75 560.05**

2023 Dividends (4.34 )$267.99 **(+$9.57)** $1,226.50 **(+$112.65)**

**2024 Shares 63.32 616.7**

2024 Dividends (4.39) $277.97 **(+$9.98)** $1,350.57 **(+$124.07)**

**2025 Shares 64.95 679.08**

2025 Dividends (4.44) $288.37 **(+$10.4)** 1,487.18 **(+$136.61)**

**2026 Shares 66.64 747.77**

2026 Dividends (4.49) $299.21 **(+$10.84) $**1,637.61 **(+$150.43)**

**Total Returns: $1,641.18 $7,827.24 (4.7 Times more)**

In this ""5 year chart"" we can see what would happen if you added $0 extra and only re-invested the dividends, assuming JNJ continues to increase its dividends by $0.05, and the stock appreciations stay the same with 0.00% growth.

Even with a $0.05 increase JNJ is almost 5 TIMES slower then GOF's compounding. There is a few major factors to this mainly being that JNJ has:

* a much smaller yield small yield (2.5%)
* Its significantly more expensive then GOF

These small factors obviously won't change overnight or even in years, so GOF will always beat out JNJ with these numbers (Even if JNJ had insane increases it would still seriously struggle to beat GOF) in both the short term and LT (if we exclude dividends). If growth does get added (which we have to use past data cause we don't know the future) JNJ would probably beat GOF. But then your also planning to sell JNJ for... what? more then likely more JNJ when it falls back down or for an income fund cause your ready to start focusing on large monthly return.

This is why Income investing is becoming more and more appealing for people to invest in high yield/income stocks. The increase in large blue-chip dividends (even with 5 years/1,825 days) is significantly smaller then GOF's dividend return. You have to rely on ""It's value will continue to increase"", or your stuck with an insanely small yield.

Major Advantages to this strategy:

**Stock Appreciation doesn't matter**

* A F.I.R.E / Income investor is investing in these type of stocks to purposely build up monthly income, if the stock price falls great! You can buy more at a nice discount, the stock price literally doesn't effect you.  
EX:  
If GOF falls to $0.01 it will continue to pay its 0.182 dividend. Just because the price falls doesn't mean the yield will as well or they will cut the dividend. That is a few ""risky"" stocks like Split Corps.

**ETFs/CEFs fall less in volatile markets**

* If a market crash was to happen, ETFs and CEFs normally fall less then single stocks. QYLD, NUSI will fall less then MSFT or APPL will. this is due to the ETFs holding more then just those 2 companies. On top of that ETFs and CEFs normally pay a much higher dividend then single companies will.

**Dividend compounding**

* As shown above high yield income focused stocks can give a faster compounding then large companies. While some investors in large companies (APPL, MSFT, JNJ, MMM) are there for the growth and slowly increasing dividends the growth isn't always guaranteed and can slow down or speed up. You don't know for sure.

**Stock appreciation CAN still happen for income stocks**

* Income stocks can see some minor growth, while MSFT will run 9% or more NUSI, JEPI, QYLD might only run 0.9% or less. But overtime this will slowly climb as well. This is more of an extremely minor ""extra"" as you normally aren't in this strategy for stock appreciation

# RISKS: 

# Yield Traps (Seriously watch out for these)

This video explains it a lot better than I could ever try:[The Dividend Yield Trap explained with 5 Examples - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRv10mQee4s)

While this can be extremely easy to avoid new investors normally jump into stocks that are yield traps due to ""oh look an insane yield!"" and nose dive into it without research or they do minor research. For the love of god do your own DD PLZ! your saving yourself a ton of trouble.

**You loss out on Stock Appreciation:**

* Although you can get some minor growth from income stocks you won't get as much as an ETF (with low yield) in the S&P 500, or single companies like MSFT, or APPL. This is the major thing you are sacrificing for this strategy (if its worth it is ultimately up to you).

**""Expiration dates"":**

* Not really a risk but a ""just so you know"" type of thing. This is more common in Canadian stocks but some stocks and split corps have ""expiration dates"".EX: EIT.UN (EIT-UN.TO) has an expiration date of June 2050 for example. This means the CEF will be ""unlisted""/removed in June 2050, unless the company that owns the CEF wants to expand its ""expiration date"" (which is normally the case). In Canada your broker will sell the ETF/CEF for you automatically and deposit the cash back into your ""available funds"" to ether withdraw or re-invest.

**EDIT:**

( [u/DontForgetTheDivy](https://www.reddit.com/u/DontForgetTheDivy/) asked for GOF's holdings so here ya go!)  
GOF Holdings:

GOF, in my opinion, is an insanely weird CEF. It has **683 Holdings** with

* Corporate - 68.39%
* Securitized (Basically all bonds) - 15.73%
* Cash and Equivalents - 3.71%
* Municipal - 2.58%

lwi7bk_JNJ,JNJ,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

luj0is_JNJ,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Valuation,"**History:** Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is the most diversified and respected mega-cap health care company in the United States. It provides services and products for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets globally. Johnson & Johnson is a parent company for over 250 subsidiaries. Together, the companies make up “the Johnson & Johnson family of companies.” 

 **Recent History:** During our fight against COVID-19, Johnson & Johnson has been working closely with its own vaccine trials for the past few months. The hard work and due diligence of its scientists led to the recent FDA approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last week. Because the vaccine requires only one dose, it will help protect 100 million people and will take effect more quickly than the two-dose vaccines.

In a statement, the agency said it has notified the company and federal officials involved in vaccine distribution so that they can prepare to ship the vaccine shortly. The FDA may issue an emergency use authorization as soon as Saturday, with the first few million doses — of a shot that is relatively simple to store, handle and administer — distributed next week.

lmao59_JNJ,JNJ,BULLISH on $JNJ,"Long time; first time

TLDR; I like the stock. I like 1 shot. I like easy logistics. I like tested against variants. I like high protection against ‘prevented deaths and hospitalizations’. I like potential up-swing with vaccine approval. Don’t like lower overall effective % vs competitors. Don’t like rumored production limitations.





First off, I hope everyone out there is staying safe during these crazy times. I’ve been learning a lot from being a lurker on here these past few months of quarantine/semi-quarantine life.

Now, let’s get to the point. I’m BULLISH on Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ). A bluechip, long-standing American-based company founded in 1886, no.37 on F500, huge portfolio, nice dividends - shit ain’t goin’ anywhere. 

In my opinion, JNJ’s upcoming vaccine will be a big step in the battle against COVID worldwide. I believe it has a lot of upside versus its competitors. JNJ has a large pool of resources and plenty of support from the Biden administration.

JNJ’s vaccine is currently awaiting emergency authorization approval (hopefully by the end of the month), but everything seems to be looking good and vaccines are already being produced with partner $EBS. JNJ’s vaccine has a lot of advantages in the production/logistics dept., which is currently a problem for other vaccines. Things things I like:

-Vaccine takes only 60-70 days to produce (Pfizer is 110 days)

-JNJ vaccine can stay in STANDARD FRIDGE temperatures for 3 MONTHS (compared to sub-zero vaccines)

-JNJ says 100m vaccines by this summer, probably making millions/billions more in foreseeable future (rumored production limitations)

-SINGLE DOSE, easy logistics

-More effective versus variants

-65% effective overall but 85% EFFECTIVE PREVENT SEVERE CASES

-Worldwide demand

-JNJ taking same technology for vaccines/trials fighting against Ebola/HIV/Zika/more

$JNJ and a lot of the healthcare industry are currently trending upward. I’m hoping it runs up short-term with vaccine approval later this month. Long-term BULL attitude as well, taking COVID vaccine tech and fighting other diseases. Safe investment, good dividends, potential short-to-mid term upside. 

There is also a lot of MSM support with strong projections:

https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=JNJ#:~:text=The%2016%20analysts%20offering%2012,the%20last%20price%20of%20166.79.

https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/johnson-johnson/jnj/


This is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I just want us all to be safe, happy and make tendies. 

Currently poor-ish and in for 10 @ 163. Hopefully buying more.

lkf06i_JNJ,JNJ,JNJ Stock Split?,JNJ stock is basically trading at all time highs right now. It has done 6 stock splits throughout its history. They had 2 three for ones and 4 two for ones. The first occurred when their price was hovering around $160 a share. The other 5 all occurred when their price was hovering around the $100.00 range. The past shows that JNJ is interested in keeping their stock affordable and cheap like Apple. If history shows and data shows something it looks like we are overdue for one. I am curious about other peoples thoughts on whether or not the company will do one again. Or if you guys are not interested in stock split at all. Me personally I would like to see one so I could accumulate more shares. I know what your thinking “just buy fractional shares!” I use TD Ameritrade so thats not an option.

l5hrrb_JNJ,JNJ,Help with PLUG and JNJ,"Hey! This might be random, but I'd love to see the feedback I get. I use a very small brokerage account as an ""Emergency Fund/Explore the Market"" account. I started with just under $1,000 as per Dave Ramsey's initial emergency fund/baby step. I couldn't stand just letting the money sit in a shit savings account, so I invested it in some ""basics,"" like Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson. I've now also got some VTI, some Zoom, and some Plug, among a few others. My overall strategy is buy and hold, but I do want to make sure I'm not missing massive opportunities to sell. What I reinvest in when I sell is where I get lost. But it's so hard to not sell Plug right now. How do I make these decisions, especially if this is mostly for fun/preservation of capital? I'm surprisingly risk averse, though I'd be filthy rich had I poured more initial capital into this thing 5 years ago (we probably all say that at times).

Best example is PLUG, which I'm up 922% on. The equity is fairly low, but it now makes up 35% of my portfolio. Entire portfolio is up nearly 220% all time. Most of my Plug shares were purchased at $3.00, some closer to $10. Anyway...just wanted to throw it out there and get any advice. Buy and hold is my main approach, but I obviously get antsy at times and wonder what I'm waiting for to start making some basic moves. All I've really done in the past few years is get rid of XBI cuz it was doing nothing and get out of Disney b/c it was just too boring.

jyefjd_JNJ,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Additionally, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Furthermore the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

gdyk56_JNJ,JNJ,Undisclosed Biotech Info $ARWR Announcement 5/7 (ARWR & JNJ Collaboration on COVID-19 Vaccine),"I’m going to try to keep this simple so you can all follow along. I’ve been in this company for years and have been following everything surrounding it. This is going to show you all the stars aligning showing that $ARWR is likely helping Johnson & Johnson with their COVID-19 vaccine. When this is announced ARWR is going to skyrocket.

# Part 1 JNJ Vaccine

JnJ is developing one of the best vaccines for COVID-19.

[Vaccine](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use)

# Part 2 ARWR & JnJ deal

When this deal was made it was for Janssen to receive a license on ARWR’s HBV drug that is in clinical trials. This deal also had another part which is that JNJ has the option to collaborate on up to 3 more targets. JnJ has already seen all the HBV data and knows how effective ARWR’s TRiM platform is.

[The Deal](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arrowhead-enters-37-billion-license-and-collaboration-agreements)

# Part 3 Pulling it all together

Today a new presentation was announced titled “Can we target coronavirus RNA with siRNA drugs?” The answer to this is YES and ALNY has already shown that RNAi can target COVID-19. Now what is ARWR doing at a discussion around Coronavirus? If they are doing nothing with Coronavirus then why are they invited and why even talk about it? The answer is they are working on it, likely with a partner and it will be the wild card revealed during the conference call.

[The Presentation](https://pharmaphorum.com/events/can-we-target-coronavirus-rna-with-sirna-drugs/)

The announcement is most likely going to be this Thursday 5/7 during $ARWR’s conference call.

**TLDR:**

**ARWR is helping develop one of the leading vaccines and the partnership is going to be announced Thursday.**

**ARWR 5/15 $40 calls**

This is Geron's only drug so it is essentially all or nothing. They took out a $250m shelf offering for either the continuation of phase 3 study for imetelstat with JNJ or go at it solo. They have the funds to continue.

&#x200B;

There are also job listings by Jansenn & JNJ for imetelstat and people on linked-in who work at JNJ who reference being in the imetelstat sales department. I do not understand the short volume, but the stock has went from 3.82 to 4.29 in a little over a week. A squeeze is inevitable. 

&#x200B;

I have more links and data of articles and files from online (patents, study results, ongoing studies, phase 3 recruiting). JNJ has complete control over this drug, and the potential is turning out to be bigger than expected with more studies beginning or rebooting with new imetelstat results.

8e4cio_JNJ,JNJ,How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.,"Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot ~~understate~~ overstate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

---

---

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road. ",2018-04-22,1254,232

tzh8t_JNJ,JNJ,Replacing JNJ. Seeking opinion on other long term options for solid dividends. ,"Been considering a few.. EMR, CLX, SYY, PG, KMB, KO (watching it prior to split).

JNJ has represented more of a consumables segment inside of my portfolio. I own ABT and TEVA for strict pharma plays.

JNJ has been nearly flat for the 3 years I've held it and looks to not be heading anywhere. I'd like to replace it with a consumables or manufacturing company that will be a staple in the slow and multi-year economic recovery. If someone thinks JNJ is a fantastic candidate for that description, please tell me what I'm missing.

Other dividend stocks I currently own include GE, T, VZ, INTC, etc. 

Anyone care to offer some input?
Thanks!",2012-05-22,7,16
