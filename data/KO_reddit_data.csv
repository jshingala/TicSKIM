1knbslw_KO,KO,$PEP is a food company. $KO is a beverage company. They are not comparable.,"Moreover, part of the bear case against Pepsico is waning consumer demand for soft drinks and price sensitivity, which would actually hurt Coke more, given that a larger portion of their revenue comes from soft drinks and that they're priced 28% higher. 

I'm not a huge PEP investor, but the comparison between the two companies that always comes up seems to be rooted in ignoring the fact that 60% of Pepsi's revenue comes from food. ",2025-05-15,59,38

1k6y4pm_KO,KO,"I never imagined PEP could trend so close to ""zero"". Meanwhile, KO and MCD are holding up remarkably well despite the current market volatility.","PepsiCo (PEP) recently cut its full-year profit forecast, citing increased costs from tariffs and ongoing macroeconomic volatility. The company reported core earnings per share of $1.48 on revenues of $17.92 billion for the latest quarter, slightly missing analyst expectations. Shares have declined about 6% since the beginning of the year.

In contrast, Coca-Cola (KO) has been resilient (haha, all time high). JPMorgan analysts have reiterated an ""overweight"" rating on Coca-Cola, raising their price target from $74 to $78, citing the company's defensive positioning and strong projected organic sales growth in 2025. Additionally, Coca-Cola announced a dividend of $0.51 per share, maintaining its status as a reliable dividend payer. ‚Äã

McDonald's (MCD) stock has reached an all-time high, closing at $289.93 recently. The company's strategic acquisitions and digital transformation efforts have enhanced customer experience and driven sales growth. Despite some challenges, such as rising labor costs and supply chain disruptions, McDonald's plans to open 2,200 new locations in 2025, including 1,000 in China, indicating strong growth prospects.

1hvgj1s_KO,KO,What are your honest thoughts about Coca-Cola (KO)? Time to buy?,,2025-01-07,72,96
1hs0909_KO,KO,"How does Coca-Cola (KO) manage to ""survive"" with a quick ratio below 1?","Question is straightforward. If any company keeps a low quick ratio for many quarters in a row, how can still consider it a healthy company? Doesn't that mean the company keeps on refinancing its debt and getting indebted further? Or does it mean (instead) that the company keeps paying interest perpetually? I want to understand the exact dynamics going on here. Thanks!

EDIT: thanks everyone for your answers! To shed some light for newcomers (I realised this thanks to all the answers provided below, plus my own 'aha' moment) the quick ratio is a balance-based ratio that uses a snapshot of the current liquid assets and the current liabilities. Taking current liabilities is reasonable, but (as everyone is saying) current liquid assets are not that important for a business that is making money. Actually, keeping cash or liquid assets around at any point (or, in particular, at the time the balance snapshot is taken) is silly as it means the assets are not generating any returns at all. Companies with stable revenue will use cash flows (not reflected in the balance sheet AT ALL) to pay back their debt.

The ratio that uses income statement information and explains Coke's situation better is the interest coverage ratio, which is:

Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / interest expense (for the period)

TTM EBIT (for most purposes, operating income) is $14.4 billion as of January 2, 2025.  
TTM net interest expense is $0.587 billion (interest expense is $1.683 B but interest income is $1.051 B). To look at the worst-case scenario here, I'm going to use the interest expense of $1.683 B instead of the net difference. If anyone can shed some light as to what would be more reasonable, please let me know.

In the case of Coca-Cola, the interest coverage ratio is:

$14.4 B / $1.683 B = 8.56

Coke can pay back its short-term debt over 8 times using most of what's left over from its yearly revenue (and more than that if you also consider the small amount of liquid assets kept on hand at any single time).

Hope this is useful to others as well!",2025-01-02,37,15

Honestly, I see $KO making a huge rebound with a one month time period back to $65.

Besides the stock just not going up at least 4.99% before last expiration, I don't see any issue with this trade given the RSI(14) indicating it is oversold, it is nearly touching the bottom MA(50), and below it's shorter span moving averages. It surely must go back up, right?

I'm wondering when would be a good time to close out my position? Should I wait for further gains, or is now a good time to cash in, given the market's current volatility?

Also, I have around $10,000 ready to deploy into new investments. I'm looking for some solid stock suggestions that have good potential for growth. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm considering:

1. **Tech Giants:** With AI and tech continuing to drive the market, I'm thinking about adding to positions in companies like Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT). They've had strong earnings reports and seem to be well-positioned for the future.

2. **Healthcare:** Stocks like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Pfizer (PFE) might offer some stability, especially with the ongoing advancements in the healthcare sector. What do you guys think about the long-term prospects of these stocks?

3. **Energy:** With the current global situation, energy stocks might be a good play. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) could benefit if oil prices rise. Any thoughts on the sustainability of these companies' dividends?

4. **Dividend Aristocrats:** Considering Coca-Cola is a dividend aristocrat, I'm also looking at other dividend-paying stocks for consistent income. Procter & Gamble (PG) or PepsiCo (PEP) could be interesting additions.

2. **Healthcare:** Stocks like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Pfizer (PFE) might offer some stability, especially with the ongoing advancements in the healthcare sector. What do you guys think about the long-term prospects of these stocks?

3. **Energy:** With the current global situation, energy stocks might be a good play. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) could benefit if oil prices rise. Any thoughts on the sustainability of these companies' dividends?

4. **Dividend Aristocrats:** Considering Coca-Cola is a dividend aristocrat, I'm also looking at other dividend-paying stocks for consistent income. Procter & Gamble (PG) or PepsiCo (PEP) could be interesting additions.

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether I should hold or sell my KO stock and any other stock suggestions you have for my $10k investment. Looking forward to the discussion!

Thanks!",2024-08-15,2,22
1eilrn9_KO,KO,Starting KO stock position,"Ive been investing casually into apple stock for the past 5 years. Recently I have been looking into more affordable stocks that pay a consistent dividend that I can build quickly over time. I have begun buying KO shares at approximately 8-10 shares each month.

It should be mentioned that this is my regular brokerage account via fidelity. I have a 457b through my work. The goal of this account is to have assets available to sell if needed while letting my money work for me.

19ea32h_KO,KO,Should I sell KO for SCHD?,"Hi there, I'm (38) relatively new to investing. I purchased 17 shares of KO (Coca-Cola Co) shares in my taxable account last year in part because they have such a great reputation as ""hold forever"" stocks and are also beloved by Warren Buffet. 

A little bit of background - my retirement account is fully comprised of VTI (80%) and VXUS (20%), but I wanted to create a dividend portfolio in my taxable account to help supplement my income down the road as I'm in a field where my income can be unpredictable. I don't plan on retiring for at least 25 years, and I would like to drip all my dividends for at least the next 15-20 years. 

Given all this, I was wondering if it made sense to sell KO and just add to my SCHD holdings. While KO is considered stable, I'd prefer growth.  KO also currently has a lower dividend yield than SCHD. I've only made a small amount of profit on KO so it wouldn't be a big tax hit. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.",2024-01-24,3,9

16kyonc_KO,KO,Coca Cola ($KO) vs Pepsi ($PEP): Are Either Worth Buying Right Now?,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.  
  
So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?  
  
Historically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings 

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6. 

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that. 

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).   
  
However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends 

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.  
  
That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.   
  
At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. 

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?  
  
**TLDR; Pepsi looks better technically, Coke has a better valuation, but neither are really at a good price point for new entrants.**",2023-09-17,164,82
16kyu5l_KO,KO,Coca Cola ($KO) vs Pepsi ($PEP): Are Either Worth Buying Right Now?,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it's hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead? 

[Historically, Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's.](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings. 

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%,](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6% and revenue estimates by 2.7%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then. 

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D)which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke. 

# Dividends 

Coke does have a [better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster. 

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but they are almost identical. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. [The Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

zr8iva_KO,KO,Unpopular opinion: $KO is overvalued and I sold my shares,"Coca-Cola Co. has been a fantastic stock for decades upon decades and I still love it. However, I sold my shares a few weeks ago at $64 per share. My cost basis was below $60 and I decided that I would sell into strength and wait for a better opportunity to buy back in. This qualifies as timing the market, but I feel justified in waiting for better valuations in a world of higher interest rates and Fed tightening. Plus, I had losses to offset before year end. 

The current yield is just 2.8%, below its 10 year average of approximately 3.1%. Also, its dividend growth is far less impressive than similar stocks with a 5 year dividend growth rate of only 3.5%. Pepsi, for example, has a 5 year growth rate of over 7%. I would much prefer a yield above 3% or a growth rate above 5% before I consider entering a new position. Does anyone have any analysis to support re-entering $KO at the current price?

Full disclosure: I am short a Cash Secured Put in order to try and get a lower cost entry and intend to roll that position over until the price reaches a more desirable entry. Therefore, I am technically long $KO, but in a manner consistent with my overall thesis (at a lower price).",2022-12-21,196,165

vbez2o_AXP,AXP,"Warren Buffett says these are the best stocks to own when inflation spikes ‚Äî with consumer prices still surging, it's time to follow his lead - $CXV $AAPL $KO $AXP","[https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes)

Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven‚Äôt seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% ‚Äî down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs.

Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.

Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has [plenty of advice](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/5-top-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-shareholder-meeting) on what to own when consumer prices spike.

In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.

Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.

## American Express (AXP)

Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.

The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.

American Express makes most of its money through discount fees ‚Äî merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.

Business is booming. In Q1, the company‚Äôs revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion.

American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire‚Äôs stake is worth nearly $24 billion.

Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.

American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%.

 

## Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola is a classic example of a [recession-resistant](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/jim-rogers-warns-big-collapse-and-recession) business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.

The company‚Äôs entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands ‚Äî including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater ‚Äî give it plenty of pricing power.

Add solid geographic diversification ‚Äî its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.

Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ‚Äô80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion.

You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.

 

## Apple (AAPL)

No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.

Earlier last year, management revealed that the company‚Äôs active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.

While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don‚Äôt want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.

Today, Apple is Buffett‚Äôs largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire‚Äôs portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple‚Äôs stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%.

Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.

 

## Chevron (CVX)

One of Buffett‚Äôs big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 ‚Äî a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.

Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.

It‚Äôs not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.

Oil ‚Äî the most heavily traded commodity globally ‚Äî has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by [Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/ukraine-invasion-protect-your-portfolio) could keep that trend going.

Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022.

The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%.",2022-06-13,23,25

s9wenx_KO,KO,SCHD: how come KO is their biggest holding now?,"So, I understand how KO could pass SCHD¬¥¬¥\`¬¥'s screening process and be part of the ETF, I just don\`'t get how it could make it to the largest holding:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tx74tqoto6d81.png?width=2354&format=png&auto=webp&s=102c4e25e19ae0d8cb911ada16302321b13a7cb9

&#x200B;

Let's have a look at the different aspects SCHD takes a look at, which are:

&#x200B;

1. At least 10 consecutive years of dividend payments.
2. Minimum $500 million market cap.
3. Best combination of cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield and 5-year dividend growth rate.
4. Selecting the 100 highest-yielding stocks among the universe of qualifying components.

&#x200B;

Then, for KO:

Points number 1 and 2 are clearly fulfilled. However:

&#x200B;

* Dividend yield: 2,78% -> not bad but also not great. Also, lower than the ETF's yield.
* Dividend Growth Rate 5 year: 4,5% -> Again, lower than the ETF's Dividend Growth.
* Dividend Growth Rate 1 year: 2,5% -> In this case extremely lower than the ETF's Dividend Growth.
* Payout:n 82%.

&#x200B;

So a I missing something? I am not saying KO is a bad stock, but I guess there are many other stocks out there that fulfill SCHD's own criteria in a much better way, specially taking into account points 3 and 4.

q0tdln_KO,KO,Thoughts on buying KO (Coke) with Pepsi earnings coming up?,"Last earnings report, Pepsi had a spectacular earnings, and KO went up along because it was widely thought KO's earning would reflect what Pepsi had. Pepsi's earnings is this Tuesday pre market, and I was thinking about picking up KO on Monday as a short term play (a few months), but can evolve into a long term play depending on how things turn out. I have two main reasons:

1. I think the earnings will beat again. More and more people are starting to go out not only in the United States, but also around the world. Restaurants have more people, movies have more people, travel, and many more.
2. KO can pass inflation costs down to consumers. With high inflation uncertainty, at worst case, KO can just increase the price, and consumers will pay the price of inflation, and earnings will probably continue to increase. People may start parking their money into stocks that can make consumers front the inflation cost, so this would be good for KO

Though one concern I have about a short term play is how hard are the supply chain issues hitting KO (if at all). The Pepsi earnings may have supply chain issues, which may rattle investors for KO alike. Though if this is the case, I think I'll just change my strategy to long, as I think it will be a ""safer"" stock to hold throughout the upcoming year, two, or three with inflation and Fed tapering / increasing rates.

What are your thoughts? Any other points that I should think about?

pksxls_KO,KO,KO Warrants w/o End Date vs. Regular Options,"I know this is more a trading/gambling topic than investing, but humor me please.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

> (In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option (but issued by a bank) that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

> For example, a KO warrant on the S&P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2.22% (note that this is linear because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100. An 11.11% rise in S&P500 to 5000 would mean 500% profit with this specific contract (600 up from 4400).), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (Time decay / No volatility) for another (KO), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Steel stocks move in tandem with one another.** $CLF and $NUE will put up their numbers on Thursday morning, and the market will then price ***all other steel stocks accordingly***. That means if $CLF/$NUE are up, the rest of steel gang will also be up bigly. The flipside is also true. If either tanks, they'll take down the respective companies. If you're looking to make a steel play, I would look to play $MT or $X options instead of $CLF/$NUE options, as they will move roughly the same amount, **but they won't get IV crushed.** Those looking to roll the dice should look to enter a position Wednesday before close, as that's when the options will be the cheapest (thanks to theta gang).

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks also move in tandem with each other.** Similar to above, $AAL, $LUV and $ALK all report Thursday morning. If you're looking to make a collateral play, look to play $DAL or something to avoid the IV crush. ***Alternatively***, you can also look to go long or short on the entire sector through $JETS. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we‚Äôll get huge gains on a relatively small move. This is key, since we‚Äôre going to get a large move in $JETS as the *entire sector* will fly (lol) or crash after Thursday since the market will price all airline stocks, not just $AAL and $LUV, based off of the $AAL and $LUV earnings. On average, airlines move around 4.5% post earnings, so we should see a comparable movement in $JETS. If we get such a move in $JETS, we‚Äôll have at minimum a five bagger on deck. More information about this [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *under 6%* on both sides of the chain. What really makes this pricing weird is the fact that Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO. If you're gambling on this one, the odds are *really* in your favour. That being said, maybe Wall Street knows something, I've honestly got no idea. The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true.

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-07-18,15,3

okj7u3_KO,KO,$KO for Tomorrow?,"I will definitely put my eye on $KO, since it has a high volume today, and steady grow up. Also, they are going to have report next week, so I believe the volume will go higher than today. $CO also reaches it one year high. If it can break the resistance line, it may be a good entry point.

&#x200B;

[Today Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nfwm6ddhcab71.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fdd722888f2fb2262fcaf7f2d17824d9166424c)

&#x200B;

Again, it's just my opinion. Since $CO price is on 1 year high, it is risky to play with it. However, I think it will be interested to watch in next few days. Especially, the report is coming and price is going to break the resistance. so there may be many rooms to do short or long in intra day.

nhov3b_KO,KO,Is it wise to invest in Coca Cola for Dividends?,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue collar company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue collar company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff I don't understand like crypto, and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)

m8zo7i_KO,KO,Could AMZN be in 2050 what KO is to investors today,"What I mean by this is that companies like KO are seen as slow-growth, value companies with wide market share over a core product / service and a decent moat.

Everyone will get a bottled beverage from time to time and it will likely come from KO. It's difficult to penetrate the beverage market because you need marketing, a brand, and an efficient supply chain. Buffett realized this with KO and it worked well for him.

However, KO is not going to be seeing monster growth, compared to something like a small cap, because everyone is already chugging beverages anyway.

Could AMZN become KO? In the sense that building out warehousing, a large-capacity E-commerce marketplace, and efficient shipping logistics (1 and 2 day) are large moats unlikely to be beaten by newcomers? Might not see monster growth because everyone around me is already saying ""check on Amazon,"" but it seems good own for slow-steady growth.

Thinking about buying some AMZN and slapping it in an IRA, seems like a decent idea but wondering other people's thoughts on the security of AMZN as a long-term investment.",2021-03-20,4,26

l1hyxr_KO,KO,"The Restaurants, NYSE: KO, Your Quiet Ticket to Tendie Heaven","The autists of this hellpit we call a forum come from many a place across the world, but many of us live in the United States and despite how diverse the cultures of our country are, there is one thing we see coast to coast. The fatass American. Their natural habitat is the aisles of Walmart, preferring watering holes filled with sugar and surrounded by plains lush with potato chips. Now you may avert your eyes out of politeness, you may stare for a second out of surprise or give an inward chuckle but you should be thanking this graceful beast for it is on its back that you will ride to your gold plated mansion. 

&#x200B;

KO is the play here. These guys are in the pit of the worst COVID Round II could throw at em. With pubs and restaurants recently restricted in the UK ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52977388](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52977388)) and the US still under lock downs in many states the restaurant and entertainment industries have been hit hard. Coke-a-cola sells to just about everyone in these sectors. That is a bold as fuck statement, but think about it. It's impossible to find a fast food restaurant without coke and even harder to find a sit in entertainment or dining establishment that doesn't sell coke products unless Pepsi has bought rights. Given 39% of their revenue is from North America ([https://market.us/statistics/food-and-beverage-companies/coca-cola-company/](https://market.us/statistics/food-and-beverage-companies/coca-cola-company/)) this establishes a retard's understanding of why they're down so where does the fatass American come in. 

&#x200B;

Here. Uncle Sam just unloaded his printer onto the financially ignorant masses at the same time the vaccine is being delivered out to the most at risk. People are going to be biting at the bit to have restrictions removed and no politician wants to continue the small business blood bath the shutdowns have caused. Fatass American sees slowly opening businesses and has 2k in government money to do whatever the fuck they want with. You can bet food, theater and sports properties will be rolling in it. KO is gonna be there for all of it. 

&#x200B;

Combine this with a beautiful chart, showing support quite near the 48.58 the stocks currently at and the ungodly strength of this bull market this is one that simply cant go tits up. I'm in for the 4/16/21 50c because I fear theta gang and it's cheap enough I can grab a dozen. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fatass has government money, restaurants and entertainment gonna be selling more food soon, ""I'll have a large coke"" uttered by millions, buy 4/16/21 50c if you wanna give yourself some breathing room, buy 02/19/21 49c if you have the golden balls of the bull.",2021-01-20,16,14

hqnnqw_KO,KO,Coke (KO) PSA,"Hi Everyone.

Lavender here with today's Public Service Announcement.

PepsiCo reported decent numbers today. Revenues were only down 3%. Wait. They were down 3 percent????? Why?!

Oh. That's because even though their snack business crushed it last quarter, most of those fast food and fast casual restaurants that serve their carbonated beverages were closed. Some went out of business. Others were closed for a stay at home order. Movie theaters were empty and theme parks were...well not many people going to theme parks either, huh?

But wait. Weren't other places open?

Yes they were. But the people who bought at those places didn't get free refills and just left after picking up their food to go. Many didn't need a drink at all because what's the point if you are just taking it home. (And who wants some random GrubHub driver drinking some of your Cherry Pepsi before you get it.)

So what does that mean for Coke? Not sure. Maybe they pull a rabbit out of their hat and have only a 5% revenue decline this quarter. Maybe thier sales will be flat vs the prior quarter.  Can it happen? Sure. But I doubt it.

Pepsi's decline was 7% last quarter, but Coke has more penetration in restaurants than Pepsi. So I would guess that Coke's decline is double digits in carbonated beverages segment. And that could be bad for the stock.

Anywhow. For those in the stock, this is your opportunity to revisit your assumptions and potentially sell. For those out of the stock, here's easy prey to hedge against a market decline.

Until next time, this is Lavender wishing you good luck in a crazy market full of volatility.

**AMD ‚Äì Advanced Micro Devices**

AMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There‚Äôs been an uptick in the semi‚Äôs as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.

**DKNG ‚Äì DraftKings**

Draftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.

**KO ‚Äì Coca Cola**

Big call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn‚Äôt have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.

**INTC ‚Äì Intel Corporation**

I caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It‚Äôs possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.

**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**

Didn‚Äôt spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven‚Äôt seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We‚Äôll find out this week.

Big funds looking for value and dividends should flock here too.   

* Coca-Cola increased its dividend for 57 consecutive years, now paying roughly a 3.5% yield.
* For 2020, Pepsi declared an annual dividend of¬†$3.82 per share, the same level it paid in 2019, and around a 3% dividend yield.

This is a long-term income investment, and not appropriate for you YOLO guys. I will put a screenshot of the position in the comments.**

One of the best times to enter a stock position is when it breaks to new highs.  This is the case with KO.  It can also be subject to a ""push down"" by the short guys.  So, the breakout can be smooth or turbulent.  KO pays a good dividend at 3.1%.  The Staples sector is currently (one month basis) out-performing the S&P 500.

Entered this position today at $49.61 per share.  Immediately place a collar on the position.  This was done by selling a December 21 '18  $50 Call for $0.58.  Took $0.17 of  that premium and purchased a December 21 '18 $46 Put.  The net premium of the hedge is $0.41 - about 3/4 of one percent.

Goal was to enter the position with only 10% max downside risk, and to do so without out of pocket cost to hedge.

Potential outcomes:

* The short sellers try to push the stock back down.  That is not likely as short float is less that one percent.  The Protective Put gives you an opportunity to see how the breakout progresses without unlimited downside risk.
* The stock goes up above the short strike of the Covered Call.  Simple solution, you roll up and out the Covered Call for a Credit.

There are many other ways to make this trade, Calendar, Call Verticals, etc.  This is just an example.

**Investment Thesis** 

The Coca-Cola Company (‚ÄúKO‚Äù) equity represents a rare opportunity to invest in a misunderstood mega-cap that is set to expand margins, grow free cash flow, and increase returns on invested capital. My variant opinion is that at 23.4x NTM earnings, KO equity currently does not price in the upside offered by the forthcoming completion of their bottling operation restructuring efforts and instead reflects the typical consensus story of whether volumes will either be LSD or MSD. Normalized earnings, through the noise of the restructuring operations, show a business that is set to return capital to shareholders after several years of disappointing returns (~5.0% P.A. excl. dividend 2012 ‚Äì Present). 

**Business Description** 

KO produces syrup concentrate used in the production of various carbonated and un-carbonated beverages. KO‚Äôs syrups are sold to bottler partners on a global basis. These bottler partners control regional/local Coca-Cola franchises. The bottlers make the finished product, distributed in bottles and cans. Bottlers are responsible for selling, distributing KO products to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. 

60% of the Company‚Äôs FY16 revenues were derived from the sale of finished products and 40% were derived from the sale of concentrates. 48% of the Company‚Äôs FY16 revenues came from the United States while 52% came from international sales. 

It is worth noting that over the past several years KO has made an effort to diversify their brand portfolio away from traditional soft drinks and in to sports drinks and vitamin water-type offerings. 

KO maintains equity investments in their bottling partners and receive both equity-interest income and dividends. The market value of these investments is about $20bn. 

**Situation Overview**
 
Over the past three years, KO has been restructuring their bottler relationships across Europe, China, Japan, Africa and North America which will result in 100% of the Company‚Äôs unit case volume being distributed by third-party bottlers rather than KO itself. Bottler restructuring will be complete by the end of 2017. 

Parent KO is divesting their interest in their bottling rights to various partners because their national scale is too large to adequately invest in the local-level relationships necessary to build high-margin bottling operations. Restructured bottlers enter into Comprehensive Beverage Agreements (CBA) with Parent KO under which they are authorized to purchase trademark beverages from KO, or another authorized supplier, and exclusively distribute/sell to territories under their agreement. Each CBA has an indefinitely renewable 10-year term. 

Cash flow from the restructuring has been slow to materialize which is why I suspect these activities are never more than a brief footnote in consensus research. 2014 and 2015 proceeds from re-franchising was $713mn while 2016 proceeds were $2.3bn plus another $2.4bn from the sale of Keurig to JAB Holding Co. 

Proceeds through the end of 2017 should come in around $4.5mn from the sale of Chinese bottling operations, divestiture of remaining North American operations, plus dividends and income from bottling equity investments. Management has been quiet about their capital allocation intentions for these proceeds, but suffice to say they have some levers to pull. Before serious returns to shareholders can begin there are a few obligations KO needs to meet first. $3.2bn to Anheuseur-Busch InBev for their interest in CCBA which should be paid 4Q17 (KO intends to immediately sell the CCBA bottling franchise after this, so maybe it is fair to say this transaction nets out). $3.3bn debt matures in 2018, $4.5bn in 2019, and $4.4bn in 2020. 

**Valuation**

Under the following assumptions ‚Äì 0.0% revenue and EBIT growth ‚Äì KO will earn $4.9bn FCF per year. With an additional $4.5bn from 2017 activities the Company will be able to meet all of their upcoming obligations, including scheduled share repurchases and dividend hike, without raising additional debt. In fact, at 2.5x net debt, KO has room for an additional full turn of leverage (approx. $10bn debt) that could be returned to shareholders while comfortably maintaining interest coverage.

But how do normalized earnings look? KO earns a 4.3% pre-tax margin on LTM bottling revenues of $15.9bn. Backing out bottling, KO earns $14.2bn normalized LTM EBITDA and $11.4bn LTM FCF (EBITDA ‚Äì capex ‚Äì cash interest) (5.1% yield). Company bottlers earn an average 7.5% pre-tax margin on bottling revenues. Assuming 0.0% growth from acquisition of bottling operations, equity income to KO should grow ~41.0% to $1.4bn given a potential ~70.0% growth in bottling pre-tax income to $1.2bn from $0.7bn (calculated as pro-rata KO share of margin uplift plus historical growth of legacy equity income). 

On flat revenues and margins, this will result in ~$12-13bn FCF per year for KO. This is also likely understated due to the real volume benefit gained by better performing bottling operations (KO gains revenue uplift from selling more syrup to bottlers as well as a % of income due to equity ownership). Maybe a more likely scenario would be in the range of $15bn FCF (6.7% yield) per year for KO with unheroic, LSD volume growth. After debt repayments and other obligations this leaves at least an extra $3bn FCF per year for shareholders without adding incremental debt.

On top of this, KO ex-bottling operations will have $37.5bn invested capital (down about $5bn pre-restructuring). On normalized LTM EBIT this yields an ROIC of 33.9%. 

Can you find equity ideas at a more compelling valuation than a 6.7% FCF yield? Of course you can. But a 6.7% yield seems like a good deal for a $200bn market cap business with entrenched competitive dynamics that sustains a 30.0%+ return on invested capital. ",2017-10-24,10,18

You see it everywhere, it's in every movie, the brand is strong as ever, so I'm interested in your thoughts on its apparent slide this last year.

It's near a 52 week low, soda consumption is down, and diet coke one of its biggest performers of its beverage portfolio along with diet sodas in general have really fallen off. 

That being said it has juices and sports drinks and water. I'm really interested in investing in the company, and its price gets more attractive by the day, so I'm very interested in everyones thoughts about the company and its stock, most importantly:

What do you think about the long term competativeness of the company? Do you think soda consumption is in a downward trajectory indefinitely or will the tides turn back? And lastly, what price range do you think is good value for the company? I'm thinking around $35.00 per share but the likelihood of it reaching that point is rather low.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

The only account activity is that dividends are being reinvested however at YE WF dinged my checking account for $115.00 (for what I assume is the fee, but that's almost as much as the dividends I received for the year!) Scottrade is an option but from what I hear each time I have those dividends reinvested it's a ""trade"" and I would have to pay whatever the fee amount is or let the cash accumulate to certain amount then buy the shares.

1s9h8p_KO,KO,"Stop me from investing everything ($100,000) in KO - 33/35 year horizon for an income generating goal","My first post, lurked for a long time. So, let me start with a few facts as I try to read you mind and anticipate questions in the thread:

* Investing in a single stock/equity is not a great or even good idea - I know this. But is KO different? Hoping to get some real opinions here. Would you do it?
* Only debt is a 5% mortgage - $126,000 remains on this.
* We bring in about $120,000 salary a year between us both.
* Emergency fund is secured.
* We fully fund our ROTH every year with a diversified group of dividend champs/aristocrats and this will continue.
* Wife is 30, main objective is to secure an income generating portfolio for her at 62-65. Gives me a 32 year horizon, possibly more.
* DGR (dividend growth rate) and stability (moat) is what attracts me to KO.
* Will have to pay taxes every year on the dividend income, understood.
 
I look at dividend ETFs and it just makes me cringe to see the turnover rates and the fees associated.  Is the diversification worth the fees? Can any stock be safer than sweet, sweet KO?

I want to take $100,000 and stick it all in Coke stock, reinvesting the dividends for 30+ years, meahwhile forgetting we even own it.

I don't care about missing out on lots of capital gains by sticking with such a 'boring' stock. In fact the more flat the price remains the more shares I can buy with my DRIP plan. Its all about ending up with as many income/dividend generating stocks for when she retires.

Alternatively, if we pay off the mortgage (could do this in about 12 months) I will save us that 5% interest rate but we are back to zero on investing for our future. I can take future 'this would have been mortgage money' and buy shares as time passes, but dumping so much now will just start the compounding snowball years ahead of time.  Every year makes a huge difference with dividend growth investing. 

Let me provide an example:
I love this site:[BuyUpside](http://www.buyupside.com/calculators/dividendreinvestmentdec07.htm)

Here is what I get with an 8% DGR and a 2% stock growth rate - over 26,000 shares in 30 years. Assume the dividend will be 3X by then and that 100k investment nets us $93,000 yearly.  If we wait an extra 5 years before stopping the automatic reinvestment there are 64,000 shares and $230,000 yearly. This is why I am tempted to do this now, 5 years can make a huge difference.

Yes I know inflation will change the future value of those dollar quite a bit, $38,000/$81,000 respectively in inflation adjusted dollars.

So here it is everyone. Would you stop a loved one from doing this? All the eggs in one dividend machine? ",2013-12-06,0,23
