1kefze9_GOOGL,GOOGL,My Intrinsic and Relative valuation on LCID (Lucid Motors),"Hey there! I am looking to refine and improve my intrinsic valuation analysis. Any form of suggestions, criticism or feedback, be it on the format or the model or my thought processes will be appreciated!

This DD or intrinsic valuation will be for my own or for your ACADEMIC purpose. This is NOT financial advice.

For those who do not know what LCID is, this section will be for you. For those that already know what LCID does, and have an insatiable desire to see an amateur's DCF analysis, you should skip this section. I have included a summary at the end of this post. I will also be including a link to my DCF model below. I will be referencing the 10-K

I came across Lucid Motors (LCID) when I was using a screener to filter stocks by insider ownership. According to [Finviz.com](http://Finviz.com), LCID apparently has 60% insider ownership with a volume of 60M.

2025 

* Car and Driver : 10Best

There are many other miscellaneous awards, but these are what I would consider the most important among them.

**1.5 Revenue Streams**

LCID’s revenue is STRICTLY HIGHLY dependent on product sales and the sale of regulatory credits. While Lucid motors plan on supplying and licensing their relevant technologies, eg Aston Martin partnership, it is not currently a reliable source of income. From the 10-K : 

* “We recognize revenue from vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery.”
* “We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits.”
* “Revenue increased by $212.6 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4,240 in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles and an increase of $29.1 million of regulatory credit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.”

**1.6 Customer Base**

Majority of Lucid’s sales are in North America, followed by the Middle East (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) then other internationals.

* In 2023, 84.69% of total revenue came from NA, 9.91% from SA and 2.40% from other internationals. 
* In 2024, 74.03% of total revenue came from NA, 24.02% from SA and 1.95% from other internationals

**1.7 Business Readiness**

While Lucid’s R&D expenses have been increasing annually and there have been attempts at commercialization, Lucid’s main focus is currently on scaling.

**1.7.1 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1)**

North America’s first greenfield, purpose-built EV manufacturing, located in Arizona, expansion was made in 2024 to bring installed capacity to **90,000 vehicles per year**. From the 10-K :

* “We expect to achieve greater operational efficiencies and more consistent production quality than would be possible through outsourced manufacturing or adaptation of an existing facility.”
* “Vertical integration of manufacturing capabilities provides us the opportunity to control our technology roadmap, ensure a high degree of quality control, and improve product margins relative to an outsourced manufacturing arrangement.”
* Timeline : Phase 1 construction was completed in December 2020 with starting of production on September 28, 2021. 

**1.7.2 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-2 (AMP-2)**

* In 2022, Construction started in Saudi Arabia
* In 2023, semi knocked-down (“SKD”) assembly began, with installed annual capacity of **5,000** vehicles.
* In 2024, expansion started to enable completely-built-up (“CBU”) unit production with an additional installed annual capacity of **150,000 vehicles**.
* Late 2026: Targeted start for production of vehicles based on Lucid's Midsize platform, including higher-volume, more affordable models.
* The Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) supported the construction of AMP-2 by spending $67.3 million, $12.1 million and $33.3 million in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
* Relative to Lucid’s spending in **the two** consolidated manufacturing facilities, MISA is supporting 86%, 2.81% and 6.32% of the costs in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively

**2.0 Industry Overview**

With reference to the July 2021 Summer Presentation : 

* “The global luxury car market was estimated to be $495.7 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $733.2 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of \~5.0% from 2018 to 2026.”
* “With increased government mandates for electrification, combined with consumers’ growing desire for clean energy vehicles, electrification of the automotive industry is taking place globally at a rapid pace, representing 5% of all new car sales in 2020.”
* “By 2030, Lucid anticipates run-rate production of >500,000 units, representing \~4% market share of an anticipated 2030 TAM of 15mm units”

From the 10-K : 

* “The market is still nascent, with approximately 11.1% and 8.1% of new passenger vehicle sales in 2024 being battery electric vehicles worldwide and in North America, respectively (worldwide figure is an estimate from S&P Global AutoInsight, and the North America figure is an actual result from S&P Global Catalyst Registration).”

**2.1 Industry Risk**

**2.1.1 Significant Barriers to Entry**

From the 10-K :

* “The automobile industry is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing, manufacturing, and distributing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image, and the need to establish sales and service locations.”
* Lucid also competes with **long-standing established brands** and models such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz (EQ series), BMW (i7, iX), Porsche (Taycan), Audi (e-tron GT, Q8 e-tron) and etc.

**2.1.2 Supply Chain**

While Lucid is focused on in-house hardware and software innovation, and is also vertically integrated to some extent, Lucid still relies on outsourcing materials for their vehicles : 

* “We have a multi-year sourcing agreement for lithium-ion batteries, a key component of our battery system, with Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates.”
* Lucid will still be affected by current tariffs, but impacts may not be as significant as compared to other automakers who rely on outsource manufacturing.

There may be more industry risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**2.2 Company Risk**

**2.2.1 Scaling Phase**

For Lucid to achieve profitability, the revenue has to scale faster than Capital Expenditure, R&D expenses and related operating costs. 

* “We will require significant capital to develop and grow our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses”
* “In the longer term, our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability not only to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control costs on a timely basis, but also to sell in quantities and at prices sufficient to achieve our expected margins.”

There may be more company risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**3.0 Competitive Advantages**

While Lucid Motors do not have a strong moat, they do have short-term competitive advantages that gives them an edge over other EV companies.

**3.1 Partnership with Saudi Arabia (Strongest Advantage)**

Lucid is Saudi Arabia’s only major partnership with a luxury EV manufacturer.

* Committed purchase of up to 100,000 vehicles over 10 years. Minimum of 50,000 vehicles.
* AMP-2 will receive funding from the Saudi government, and Lucid will be able to establish its position as a luxury EV brand in the Middle East.

**3.2 Powertrain Technology**

Outperforms Tesla and German luxury automakers 

* Lucid entered into the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin in 2023 : Providing access to their powertrain and battery system technology to use in Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicles.

**4.0 Relative Valuation**

I would recommend referencing my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073) as you go through my justifications for my adjustments.

Here is the link to my spreadsheet : 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073)

Companies Compared:

* Chinese : BYD, XPeng, Li Auto, NIO
* US : Rivian, Tesla, Lucid
* Emerging players: Zeekr, LiveWire, Lotus, Polestar

Lucid currently stands as a high-growth, high-risk player in the luxury EV space.

* Profitability margins are consistently the most negative across the table
* Trades at a premium relative to revenue, despite worse fundamentals
* Invests aggressively in innovation and manufacturing (Scaling phase)
* BYD, LI and TSLA have positive margins and trades at a discounted EV/Revenue multiple (Except TSLA)

Lucid Motors is currently **overpriced relative to its peers** based on standard valuation multiples

**5.0 Discounted Cash Flow model**

The growth of the company will STRICTLY be dependent on their success in scaling, followed by management’s competency in establishing the brand name and securing customers.

Most of the historical data used is from Yahoo Finance. I will also be referencing the 2024 10-K and the 2021 July Investor Presentation. 

**5.1 Assumptions**

* Emerging company
* Focus is split between managing R&D, CapEx and Commercialization
* No delays in the production/deliveries of vehicles and the construction of manufacturing facilities (AMP-2)
* Maintaining partnership with Saudi Arabia + Expanding customer base in Middle east

**5.2 Revenue**

Lucid was actually VERY optimistic about its annual total deliveries and total revenue. From the [2021 July Investor Presentation](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063) (Slide 65) : 

* Lucid forecasted an annual total delivery of 20,000 in 2022, followed by 49,000 in 2023, 90,000 in 2024, 135,000 in 2025 and 251,000 in 2026.
* In Contrast, Lucid only managed to deliver 4,300 in 2022, 6,001 in 2023 and 10,241 in 2024. 
* Similarly, Lucid forecasted a total revenue of $2,219 million in 2022, followed by $5,532 million in 2023, $9,931 million in 2024, $13,985 million in 2025 and $22,756 million in 2026
* Lucid underperformed severely and forecasted results were not met.

From the 10-K : 

* “We expect to increase our market presence in multiple geographies along with the relevant retail and service footprint across each geographic region”

My Revenue projections : 

* Lucid has about 25% of unrecognized revenue from the delivery backlog until 2024 when their deliveries finally exceed their production. AMP-1 Expansion plans were also completed in 2024.
* With an efficient manufacturing facility (AMP-1), Lucid is more capable to deliver new orders and clear delivery backlog in 2025 and 2026. Revenue grows at a base rate of 40% in 2025 and 50% in 2026. 
* Revenue jumped to 70% in 2027 because Lucid’s Midsized Platform will be ready by late 2026. Additionally, the expansion of AMP-2 should be done as well.
* Revenue after 2027 will slowly taper down as Lucid continues to fulfil their partnership with Saudi Arabia.

**5.3 Operating Margin**

From the 10-K : 

* “This vertical integration has allowed us to use decades of industry experience to achieve greater capital efficiencies, greater operational efficiencies, and consistent production quality.”
* “We anticipate that a localized supply chain, production, distribution and retail network will yield cost savings and lower carbon emissions with shorter transportation distances of products to customers.”
* “On May 24, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan in 2024.”
* “We expect our cost per vehicle to improve in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 while ramping up production volumes. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be less than our manufacturing capacity.”

My EBIT Projections : 

* Lucid has been actively trying to be more cost efficient through not only expansion plans of AMP-1 and AMP-2 but also restructuring plans. I can expect more cost cutting to be done over the forecasted years.
* Due to the nature of Lucid as a CapEx intensive company, Lucid’s Operating Margins will remain negative unless the revenue scales fast enough. In the market for Luxury EV vehicles, I would expect Lucid to eventually achieve scalability before its Operating Margins can become positive. 
* With upcoming plans such as the CBU unit production in AMP-2, the completed key expansion plans with AMP-1 and the phase out operations at LPM-1 Plant, I forecasted Operating Margins to improve but remain negative with a rate of -130% in 2025. This will gradually improve and become positive in due time.

**5.4 Effective Tax Rate**

Unless Lucid becomes profitable, they will have a 0% effective tax rate. In the event that Lucid does generate taxable income, they have sufficient carry forward Net Operating Losses to offset future tax liability. 

**5.5 CapEx, D&A, Change in Working Capital**

From the 10-K : 

* “We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business.”

I took a rather complex method to project these variables. Rather than just simply referring to historical data (unreliable) or simply plugging in general industry numbers, what I did was : 

* Project Net PPE/Revenue based on industry standards, then Multiply with my projected revenue to find Projected Net PPE
* To find projected CapEx (2025), I took Projected Net PPE(2025) - Net PPE (2024) + Projected D&A (2025) for example.
* To project D&A, I simply referred to historical D&A/Net PPE ratios and adjusted accordingly.
* Similarly, I used Change in working capital as a % of Revenue as a baseline to project my Change in WC.

While this method may not exactly be the most accurate or may not be your preferred way of projecting variables, it is what I could do with my given limited knowledge. 

**5.6 Reinvestment (Extra)**

I was conflicted on whether to use FCFF = EBIT(1-t) - Reinvestment or FCFF = EBIT(1- Tax Rate) − (CapEx − Depreciation) − Change in Working Capital. I decided to choose the latter even though there are more variables to project, I can cater it to LCID’s business model.

**5.7 WACC Calculation**

The published beta for Lucid is 0.89 which is absurdly low given how volatile LCID is. Using comparables from Finviz, I obtained a bottom-up beta of 1.24 which would be a better value to use but this arbitrary number does not reflect its actual volatility. If you had chosen this value, you would have gotten a COE of 10% and a WACC of 8.11%. Instead of this : 

* I just simply plugged in my desired return COE of 25% and got a WACC value of 20%.

**5.8 Cash Flow Calculation** 

Cash flows are calculated and discounted using the mid-year convention method between 24/4/2025 and 31/12/2025. 

* Conservative Case : -1.88 per share
* Base Case : -1.67 per share
* Optimistic Case : 0.41 per share

**6.0 Summary**

Bull Case

* Technological edge : Superior Powertrain technology
* Strong partnerships : Saudi Arabia (Major shareholder)
* Strong product (won awards) and management (decades of experiences) line up

Bear Case

* Significant barriers of entry in the market for luxury EV
* Lack of moat and long-term competitive advantages
* Scaling challenges and financial sustainability

Lucid motors is **overpriced relative to its peers** and **overvalued** in today’s market. So why would you still want to invest in this company?

* Choosing to invest in LCID is the belief of management’s competency in bringing this company on the same playing field as other reputable companies. 
* Is this plausible? Assuming there are no delays or obstacles, it is possible with the backing of Saudi Arabia. At the very least, Lucid does have potential to establish its brand as a luxury EV in the Middle East. 

**7.1 Final Thoughts**

Even though my DCF may or may not be COMPLETELY wrong, I think it can still serve as a guide for Lucid’s current risk and financial uncertainty.

I would love any sort of feedback/criticisms/advice on my DCF model or on my thought processes. Whether there is a clear logical flow to what I claim and my estimates. Any improvements I could make or perhaps even a different approach. I appreciate it.

I am not a god at valuation nor do I have a degree in business. While I may have some experience, I am still learning. Again, I want to reiterate that NONE of this is financial advice.

There are many other miscellaneous awards, but these are what I would consider the most important among them.

**1.5 Revenue Streams**

LCID’s revenue is STRICTLY HIGHLY dependent on product sales and the sale of regulatory credits. While Lucid motors plan on supplying and licensing their relevant technologies, eg Aston Martin partnership, it is not currently a reliable source of income. From the 10-K : 

* “We recognize revenue from vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery.”
* “We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits.”
* “Revenue increased by $212.6 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4,240 in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles and an increase of $29.1 million of regulatory credit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.”

**1.6 Customer Base**

Majority of Lucid’s sales are in North America, followed by the Middle East (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) then other internationals.

* In 2023, 84.69% of total revenue came from NA, 9.91% from SA and 2.40% from other internationals. 
* In 2024, 74.03% of total revenue came from NA, 24.02% from SA and 1.95% from other internationals

**1.7 Business Readiness**

While Lucid’s R&D expenses have been increasing annually and there have been attempts at commercialization, Lucid’s main focus is currently on scaling.

**1.7.1 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1)**

North America’s first greenfield, purpose-built EV manufacturing, located in Arizona, expansion was made in 2024 to bring installed capacity to **90,000 vehicles per year**. From the 10-K :

* “We expect to achieve greater operational efficiencies and more consistent production quality than would be possible through outsourced manufacturing or adaptation of an existing facility.”
* “Vertical integration of manufacturing capabilities provides us the opportunity to control our technology roadmap, ensure a high degree of quality control, and improve product margins relative to an outsourced manufacturing arrangement.”
* Timeline : Phase 1 construction was completed in December 2020 with starting of production on September 28, 2021. 

**1.7.2 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-2 (AMP-2)**

* In 2022, Construction started in Saudi Arabia
* In 2023, semi knocked-down (“SKD”) assembly began, with installed annual capacity of **5,000** vehicles.
* In 2024, expansion started to enable completely-built-up (“CBU”) unit production with an additional installed annual capacity of **150,000 vehicles**.
* Late 2026: Targeted start for production of vehicles based on Lucid's Midsize platform, including higher-volume, more affordable models.
* The Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) supported the construction of AMP-2 by spending $67.3 million, $12.1 million and $33.3 million in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
* Relative to Lucid’s spending in **the two** consolidated manufacturing facilities, MISA is supporting 86%, 2.81% and 6.32% of the costs in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively

**2.0 Industry Overview**

With reference to the July 2021 Summer Presentation : 

* “The global luxury car market was estimated to be $495.7 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $733.2 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of \~5.0% from 2018 to 2026.”
* “With increased government mandates for electrification, combined with consumers’ growing desire for clean energy vehicles, electrification of the automotive industry is taking place globally at a rapid pace, representing 5% of all new car sales in 2020.”
* “By 2030, Lucid anticipates run-rate production of >500,000 units, representing \~4% market share of an anticipated 2030 TAM of 15mm units”

From the 10-K : 

* “The market is still nascent, with approximately 11.1% and 8.1% of new passenger vehicle sales in 2024 being battery electric vehicles worldwide and in North America, respectively (worldwide figure is an estimate from S&P Global AutoInsight, and the North America figure is an actual result from S&P Global Catalyst Registration).”

**2.1 Industry Risk**

**2.1.1 Significant Barriers to Entry**

From the 10-K :

* “The automobile industry is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing, manufacturing, and distributing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image, and the need to establish sales and service locations.”
* Lucid also competes with **long-standing established brands** and models such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz (EQ series), BMW (i7, iX), Porsche (Taycan), Audi (e-tron GT, Q8 e-tron) and etc.

**2.1.2 Supply Chain**

While Lucid is focused on in-house hardware and software innovation, and is also vertically integrated to some extent, Lucid still relies on outsourcing materials for their vehicles : 

* “We have a multi-year sourcing agreement for lithium-ion batteries, a key component of our battery system, with Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates.”
* Lucid will still be affected by current tariffs, but impacts may not be as significant as compared to other automakers who rely on outsource manufacturing.

There may be more industry risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**2.2 Company Risk**

**2.2.1 Scaling Phase**

For Lucid to achieve profitability, the revenue has to scale faster than Capital Expenditure, R&D expenses and related operating costs. 

* “We will require significant capital to develop and grow our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses”
* “In the longer term, our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability not only to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control costs on a timely basis, but also to sell in quantities and at prices sufficient to achieve our expected margins.”

There may be more company risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**3.0 Competitive Advantages**

While Lucid Motors do not have a strong moat, they do have short-term competitive advantages that gives them an edge over other EV companies.

**3.1 Partnership with Saudi Arabia (Strongest Advantage)**

Lucid is Saudi Arabia’s only major partnership with a luxury EV manufacturer.

* Committed purchase of up to 100,000 vehicles over 10 years. Minimum of 50,000 vehicles.
* AMP-2 will receive funding from the Saudi government, and Lucid will be able to establish its position as a luxury EV brand in the Middle East.

**3.2 Powertrain Technology**

Outperforms Tesla and German luxury automakers 

* Lucid entered into the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin in 2023 : Providing access to their powertrain and battery system technology to use in Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicles.

**4.0 Relative Valuation**

I would recommend referencing my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073) as you go through my justifications for my adjustments.

Here is the link to my spreadsheet : 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073)

Companies Compared:

* Chinese : BYD, XPeng, Li Auto, NIO
* US : Rivian, Tesla, Lucid
* Emerging players: Zeekr, LiveWire, Lotus, Polestar

Lucid currently stands as a high-growth, high-risk player in the luxury EV space.

* Profitability margins are consistently the most negative across the table
* Trades at a premium relative to revenue, despite worse fundamentals
* Invests aggressively in innovation and manufacturing (Scaling phase)
* BYD, LI and TSLA have positive margins and trades at a discounted EV/Revenue multiple (Except TSLA)

Lucid Motors is currently **overpriced relative to its peers** based on standard valuation multiples

**5.0 Discounted Cash Flow model**

The growth of the company will STRICTLY be dependent on their success in scaling, followed by management’s competency in establishing the brand name and securing customers.

Most of the historical data used is from Yahoo Finance. I will also be referencing the 2024 10-K and the 2021 July Investor Presentation. 

**5.1 Assumptions**

* Emerging company
* Focus is split between managing R&D, CapEx and Commercialization
* No delays in the production/deliveries of vehicles and the construction of manufacturing facilities (AMP-2)
* Maintaining partnership with Saudi Arabia + Expanding customer base in Middle east

**5.2 Revenue**

Lucid was actually VERY optimistic about its annual total deliveries and total revenue. From the [2021 July Investor Presentation](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063) (Slide 65) : 

* Lucid forecasted an annual total delivery of 20,000 in 2022, followed by 49,000 in 2023, 90,000 in 2024, 135,000 in 2025 and 251,000 in 2026.
* In Contrast, Lucid only managed to deliver 4,300 in 2022, 6,001 in 2023 and 10,241 in 2024. 
* Similarly, Lucid forecasted a total revenue of $2,219 million in 2022, followed by $5,532 million in 2023, $9,931 million in 2024, $13,985 million in 2025 and $22,756 million in 2026
* Lucid underperformed severely and forecasted results were not met.

From the 10-K : 

* “We expect to increase our market presence in multiple geographies along with the relevant retail and service footprint across each geographic region”

My Revenue projections : 

* Lucid has about 25% of unrecognized revenue from the delivery backlog until 2024 when their deliveries finally exceed their production. AMP-1 Expansion plans were also completed in 2024.
* With an efficient manufacturing facility (AMP-1), Lucid is more capable to deliver new orders and clear delivery backlog in 2025 and 2026. Revenue grows at a base rate of 40% in 2025 and 50% in 2026. 
* Revenue jumped to 70% in 2027 because Lucid’s Midsized Platform will be ready by late 2026. Additionally, the expansion of AMP-2 should be done as well.
* Revenue after 2027 will slowly taper down as Lucid continues to fulfil their partnership with Saudi Arabia.

**5.3 Operating Margin**

From the 10-K : 

* “This vertical integration has allowed us to use decades of industry experience to achieve greater capital efficiencies, greater operational efficiencies, and consistent production quality.”
* “We anticipate that a localized supply chain, production, distribution and retail network will yield cost savings and lower carbon emissions with shorter transportation distances of products to customers.”
* “On May 24, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan in 2024.”
* “We expect our cost per vehicle to improve in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 while ramping up production volumes. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be less than our manufacturing capacity.”

My EBIT Projections : 

* Lucid has been actively trying to be more cost efficient through not only expansion plans of AMP-1 and AMP-2 but also restructuring plans. I can expect more cost cutting to be done over the forecasted years.
* Due to the nature of Lucid as a CapEx intensive company, Lucid’s Operating Margins will remain negative unless the revenue scales fast enough. In the market for Luxury EV vehicles, I would expect Lucid to eventually achieve scalability before its Operating Margins can become positive. 
* With upcoming plans such as the CBU unit production in AMP-2, the completed key expansion plans with AMP-1 and the phase out operations at LPM-1 Plant, I forecasted Operating Margins to improve but remain negative with a rate of -130% in 2025. This will gradually improve and become positive in due time.

**5.4 Effective Tax Rate**

Unless Lucid becomes profitable, they will have a 0% effective tax rate. In the event that Lucid does generate taxable income, they have sufficient carry forward Net Operating Losses to offset future tax liability. 

**5.5 CapEx, D&A, Change in Working Capital**

From the 10-K : 

* “We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business.”

I took a rather complex method to project these variables. Rather than just simply referring to historical data (unreliable) or simply plugging in general industry numbers, what I did was : 

* Project Net PPE/Revenue based on industry standards, then Multiply with my projected revenue to find Projected Net PPE
* To find projected CapEx (2025), I took Projected Net PPE(2025) - Net PPE (2024) + Projected D&A (2025) for example.
* To project D&A, I simply referred to historical D&A/Net PPE ratios and adjusted accordingly.
* Similarly, I used Change in working capital as a % of Revenue as a baseline to project my Change in WC.

While this method may not exactly be the most accurate or may not be your preferred way of projecting variables, it is what I could do with my given limited knowledge. 

**5.6 Reinvestment (Extra)**

I was conflicted on whether to use FCFF = EBIT(1-t) - Reinvestment or FCFF = EBIT(1- Tax Rate) − (CapEx − Depreciation) − Change in Working Capital. I decided to choose the latter even though there are more variables to project, I can cater it to LCID’s business model.

**5.7 WACC Calculation**

The published beta for Lucid is 0.89 which is absurdly low given how volatile LCID is. Using comparables from Finviz, I obtained a bottom-up beta of 1.24 which would be a better value to use but this arbitrary number does not reflect its actual volatility. If you had chosen this value, you would have gotten a COE of 10% and a WACC of 8.11%. Instead of this : 

* I just simply plugged in my desired return COE of 25% and got a WACC value of 20%.

**5.8 Cash Flow Calculation** 

Cash flows are calculated and discounted using the mid-year convention method between 24/4/2025 and 31/12/2025. 

* Conservative Case : -1.88 per share
* Base Case : -1.67 per share
* Optimistic Case : 0.41 per share

**6.0 Summary**

Bull Case

* Technological edge : Superior Powertrain technology
* Strong partnerships : Saudi Arabia (Major shareholder)
* Strong product (won awards) and management (decades of experiences) line up

Bear Case

* Significant barriers of entry in the market for luxury EV
* Lack of moat and long-term competitive advantages
* Scaling challenges and financial sustainability

Lucid motors is **overpriced relative to its peers** and **overvalued** in today’s market. So why would you still want to invest in this company?

* Choosing to invest in LCID is the belief of management’s competency in bringing this company on the same playing field as other reputable companies. 
* Is this plausible? Assuming there are no delays or obstacles, it is possible with the backing of Saudi Arabia. At the very least, Lucid does have potential to establish its brand as a luxury EV in the Middle East. 

**7.1 Final Thoughts**

Even though my DCF may or may not be COMPLETELY wrong, I think it can still serve as a guide for Lucid’s current risk and financial uncertainty.

I would love any sort of feedback/criticisms/advice on my DCF model or on my thought processes. Whether there is a clear logical flow to what I claim and my estimates. Any improvements I could make or perhaps even a different approach. I appreciate it.

I am not a god at valuation nor do I have a degree in business. While I may have some experience, I am still learning. Again, I want to reiterate that NONE of this is financial advice.

Edit : Misspelled previous CEO Peter Rawlinson (correct version) as Peter Lawrinson (incorrect). \[Rectified\]",2025-05-04,2,4
1kefze9_TSLA,TSLA,My Intrinsic and Relative valuation on LCID (Lucid Motors),"Hey there! I am looking to refine and improve my intrinsic valuation analysis. Any form of suggestions, criticism or feedback, be it on the format or the model or my thought processes will be appreciated!

This DD or intrinsic valuation will be for my own or for your ACADEMIC purpose. This is NOT financial advice.

For those who do not know what LCID is, this section will be for you. For those that already know what LCID does, and have an insatiable desire to see an amateur's DCF analysis, you should skip this section. I have included a summary at the end of this post. I will also be including a link to my DCF model below. I will be referencing the 10-K

I came across Lucid Motors (LCID) when I was using a screener to filter stocks by insider ownership. According to [Finviz.com](http://Finviz.com), LCID apparently has 60% insider ownership with a volume of 60M.

**1.7.1 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1)**

North America’s first greenfield, purpose-built EV manufacturing, located in Arizona, expansion was made in 2024 to bring installed capacity to **90,000 vehicles per year**. From the 10-K :

* “We expect to achieve greater operational efficiencies and more consistent production quality than would be possible through outsourced manufacturing or adaptation of an existing facility.”
* “Vertical integration of manufacturing capabilities provides us the opportunity to control our technology roadmap, ensure a high degree of quality control, and improve product margins relative to an outsourced manufacturing arrangement.”
* Timeline : Phase 1 construction was completed in December 2020 with starting of production on September 28, 2021. 

**1.7.2 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-2 (AMP-2)**

* In 2022, Construction started in Saudi Arabia
* In 2023, semi knocked-down (“SKD”) assembly began, with installed annual capacity of **5,000** vehicles.
* In 2024, expansion started to enable completely-built-up (“CBU”) unit production with an additional installed annual capacity of **150,000 vehicles**.
* Late 2026: Targeted start for production of vehicles based on Lucid's Midsize platform, including higher-volume, more affordable models.
* The Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) supported the construction of AMP-2 by spending $67.3 million, $12.1 million and $33.3 million in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
* Relative to Lucid’s spending in **the two** consolidated manufacturing facilities, MISA is supporting 86%, 2.81% and 6.32% of the costs in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively

**2.0 Industry Overview**

With reference to the July 2021 Summer Presentation : 

* “The global luxury car market was estimated to be $495.7 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $733.2 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of \~5.0% from 2018 to 2026.”
* “With increased government mandates for electrification, combined with consumers’ growing desire for clean energy vehicles, electrification of the automotive industry is taking place globally at a rapid pace, representing 5% of all new car sales in 2020.”
* “By 2030, Lucid anticipates run-rate production of >500,000 units, representing \~4% market share of an anticipated 2030 TAM of 15mm units”

From the 10-K : 

* “The market is still nascent, with approximately 11.1% and 8.1% of new passenger vehicle sales in 2024 being battery electric vehicles worldwide and in North America, respectively (worldwide figure is an estimate from S&P Global AutoInsight, and the North America figure is an actual result from S&P Global Catalyst Registration).”

**2.1 Industry Risk**

**2.1.1 Significant Barriers to Entry**

From the 10-K :

* “The automobile industry is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing, manufacturing, and distributing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image, and the need to establish sales and service locations.”
* Lucid also competes with **long-standing established brands** and models such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz (EQ series), BMW (i7, iX), Porsche (Taycan), Audi (e-tron GT, Q8 e-tron) and etc.

**2.1.2 Supply Chain**

While Lucid is focused on in-house hardware and software innovation, and is also vertically integrated to some extent, Lucid still relies on outsourcing materials for their vehicles : 

* “We have a multi-year sourcing agreement for lithium-ion batteries, a key component of our battery system, with Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates.”
* Lucid will still be affected by current tariffs, but impacts may not be as significant as compared to other automakers who rely on outsource manufacturing.

There may be more industry risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**2.2 Company Risk**

**2.2.1 Scaling Phase**

For Lucid to achieve profitability, the revenue has to scale faster than Capital Expenditure, R&D expenses and related operating costs. 

* “We will require significant capital to develop and grow our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses”
* “In the longer term, our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability not only to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control costs on a timely basis, but also to sell in quantities and at prices sufficient to achieve our expected margins.”

There may be more company risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**3.0 Competitive Advantages**

While Lucid Motors do not have a strong moat, they do have short-term competitive advantages that gives them an edge over other EV companies.

**3.1 Partnership with Saudi Arabia (Strongest Advantage)**

Lucid is Saudi Arabia’s only major partnership with a luxury EV manufacturer.

* Committed purchase of up to 100,000 vehicles over 10 years. Minimum of 50,000 vehicles.
* AMP-2 will receive funding from the Saudi government, and Lucid will be able to establish its position as a luxury EV brand in the Middle East.

**3.2 Powertrain Technology**

Outperforms Tesla and German luxury automakers 

* Lucid entered into the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin in 2023 : Providing access to their powertrain and battery system technology to use in Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicles.

**4.0 Relative Valuation**

I would recommend referencing my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073) as you go through my justifications for my adjustments.

Here is the link to my spreadsheet : 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073)

Companies Compared:

* Chinese : BYD, XPeng, Li Auto, NIO
* US : Rivian, Tesla, Lucid
* Emerging players: Zeekr, LiveWire, Lotus, Polestar

Lucid currently stands as a high-growth, high-risk player in the luxury EV space.

* Profitability margins are consistently the most negative across the table
* Trades at a premium relative to revenue, despite worse fundamentals
* Invests aggressively in innovation and manufacturing (Scaling phase)
* BYD, LI and TSLA have positive margins and trades at a discounted EV/Revenue multiple (Except TSLA)

Lucid Motors is currently **overpriced relative to its peers** based on standard valuation multiples

**5.0 Discounted Cash Flow model**

The growth of the company will STRICTLY be dependent on their success in scaling, followed by management’s competency in establishing the brand name and securing customers.

Most of the historical data used is from Yahoo Finance. I will also be referencing the 2024 10-K and the 2021 July Investor Presentation. 

**5.1 Assumptions**

* Emerging company
* Focus is split between managing R&D, CapEx and Commercialization
* No delays in the production/deliveries of vehicles and the construction of manufacturing facilities (AMP-2)
* Maintaining partnership with Saudi Arabia + Expanding customer base in Middle east

**5.2 Revenue**

Lucid was actually VERY optimistic about its annual total deliveries and total revenue. From the [2021 July Investor Presentation](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063) (Slide 65) : 

* Lucid forecasted an annual total delivery of 20,000 in 2022, followed by 49,000 in 2023, 90,000 in 2024, 135,000 in 2025 and 251,000 in 2026.
* In Contrast, Lucid only managed to deliver 4,300 in 2022, 6,001 in 2023 and 10,241 in 2024. 
* Similarly, Lucid forecasted a total revenue of $2,219 million in 2022, followed by $5,532 million in 2023, $9,931 million in 2024, $13,985 million in 2025 and $22,756 million in 2026
* Lucid underperformed severely and forecasted results were not met.

From the 10-K : 

* “We expect to increase our market presence in multiple geographies along with the relevant retail and service footprint across each geographic region”

My Revenue projections : 

* Lucid has about 25% of unrecognized revenue from the delivery backlog until 2024 when their deliveries finally exceed their production. AMP-1 Expansion plans were also completed in 2024.
* With an efficient manufacturing facility (AMP-1), Lucid is more capable to deliver new orders and clear delivery backlog in 2025 and 2026. Revenue grows at a base rate of 40% in 2025 and 50% in 2026. 
* Revenue jumped to 70% in 2027 because Lucid’s Midsized Platform will be ready by late 2026. Additionally, the expansion of AMP-2 should be done as well.
* Revenue after 2027 will slowly taper down as Lucid continues to fulfil their partnership with Saudi Arabia.

**5.3 Operating Margin**

From the 10-K : 

* “This vertical integration has allowed us to use decades of industry experience to achieve greater capital efficiencies, greater operational efficiencies, and consistent production quality.”
* “We anticipate that a localized supply chain, production, distribution and retail network will yield cost savings and lower carbon emissions with shorter transportation distances of products to customers.”
* “On May 24, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan in 2024.”
* “We expect our cost per vehicle to improve in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 while ramping up production volumes. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be less than our manufacturing capacity.”

My EBIT Projections : 

* Lucid has been actively trying to be more cost efficient through not only expansion plans of AMP-1 and AMP-2 but also restructuring plans. I can expect more cost cutting to be done over the forecasted years.
* Due to the nature of Lucid as a CapEx intensive company, Lucid’s Operating Margins will remain negative unless the revenue scales fast enough. In the market for Luxury EV vehicles, I would expect Lucid to eventually achieve scalability before its Operating Margins can become positive. 
* With upcoming plans such as the CBU unit production in AMP-2, the completed key expansion plans with AMP-1 and the phase out operations at LPM-1 Plant, I forecasted Operating Margins to improve but remain negative with a rate of -130% in 2025. This will gradually improve and become positive in due time.

**5.4 Effective Tax Rate**

Unless Lucid becomes profitable, they will have a 0% effective tax rate. In the event that Lucid does generate taxable income, they have sufficient carry forward Net Operating Losses to offset future tax liability. 

**5.5 CapEx, D&A, Change in Working Capital**

From the 10-K : 

* “We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business.”

I took a rather complex method to project these variables. Rather than just simply referring to historical data (unreliable) or simply plugging in general industry numbers, what I did was : 

* Project Net PPE/Revenue based on industry standards, then Multiply with my projected revenue to find Projected Net PPE
* To find projected CapEx (2025), I took Projected Net PPE(2025) - Net PPE (2024) + Projected D&A (2025) for example.
* To project D&A, I simply referred to historical D&A/Net PPE ratios and adjusted accordingly.
* Similarly, I used Change in working capital as a % of Revenue as a baseline to project my Change in WC.

While this method may not exactly be the most accurate or may not be your preferred way of projecting variables, it is what I could do with my given limited knowledge. 

**5.6 Reinvestment (Extra)**

I was conflicted on whether to use FCFF = EBIT(1-t) - Reinvestment or FCFF = EBIT(1- Tax Rate) − (CapEx − Depreciation) − Change in Working Capital. I decided to choose the latter even though there are more variables to project, I can cater it to LCID’s business model.

**5.7 WACC Calculation**

The published beta for Lucid is 0.89 which is absurdly low given how volatile LCID is. Using comparables from Finviz, I obtained a bottom-up beta of 1.24 which would be a better value to use but this arbitrary number does not reflect its actual volatility. If you had chosen this value, you would have gotten a COE of 10% and a WACC of 8.11%. Instead of this : 

* I just simply plugged in my desired return COE of 25% and got a WACC value of 20%.

**5.8 Cash Flow Calculation** 

Cash flows are calculated and discounted using the mid-year convention method between 24/4/2025 and 31/12/2025. 

* Conservative Case : -1.88 per share
* Base Case : -1.67 per share
* Optimistic Case : 0.41 per share

**6.0 Summary**

Bull Case

* Technological edge : Superior Powertrain technology
* Strong partnerships : Saudi Arabia (Major shareholder)
* Strong product (won awards) and management (decades of experiences) line up

Bear Case

* Significant barriers of entry in the market for luxury EV
* Lack of moat and long-term competitive advantages
* Scaling challenges and financial sustainability

Lucid motors is **overpriced relative to its peers** and **overvalued** in today’s market. So why would you still want to invest in this company?

* Choosing to invest in LCID is the belief of management’s competency in bringing this company on the same playing field as other reputable companies. 
* Is this plausible? Assuming there are no delays or obstacles, it is possible with the backing of Saudi Arabia. At the very least, Lucid does have potential to establish its brand as a luxury EV in the Middle East. 

**7.1 Final Thoughts**

Even though my DCF may or may not be COMPLETELY wrong, I think it can still serve as a guide for Lucid’s current risk and financial uncertainty.

I would love any sort of feedback/criticisms/advice on my DCF model or on my thought processes. Whether there is a clear logical flow to what I claim and my estimates. Any improvements I could make or perhaps even a different approach. I appreciate it.

I am not a god at valuation nor do I have a degree in business. While I may have some experience, I am still learning. Again, I want to reiterate that NONE of this is financial advice.

There are many other miscellaneous awards, but these are what I would consider the most important among them.

**1.5 Revenue Streams**

LCID’s revenue is STRICTLY HIGHLY dependent on product sales and the sale of regulatory credits. While Lucid motors plan on supplying and licensing their relevant technologies, eg Aston Martin partnership, it is not currently a reliable source of income. From the 10-K : 

* “We recognize revenue from vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery.”
* “We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits.”
* “Revenue increased by $212.6 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4,240 in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles and an increase of $29.1 million of regulatory credit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.”

**1.6 Customer Base**

Majority of Lucid’s sales are in North America, followed by the Middle East (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) then other internationals.

* In 2023, 84.69% of total revenue came from NA, 9.91% from SA and 2.40% from other internationals. 
* In 2024, 74.03% of total revenue came from NA, 24.02% from SA and 1.95% from other internationals

**1.7 Business Readiness**

While Lucid’s R&D expenses have been increasing annually and there have been attempts at commercialization, Lucid’s main focus is currently on scaling.

**1.7.1 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1)**

North America’s first greenfield, purpose-built EV manufacturing, located in Arizona, expansion was made in 2024 to bring installed capacity to **90,000 vehicles per year**. From the 10-K :

* Invests aggressively in innovation and manufacturing (Scaling phase)
* BYD, LI and TSLA have positive margins and trades at a discounted EV/Revenue multiple (Except TSLA)

Lucid Motors is currently **overpriced relative to its peers** based on standard valuation multiples

**5.0 Discounted Cash Flow model**

The growth of the company will STRICTLY be dependent on their success in scaling, followed by management’s competency in establishing the brand name and securing customers.

Most of the historical data used is from Yahoo Finance. I will also be referencing the 2024 10-K and the 2021 July Investor Presentation. 

**5.1 Assumptions**

* Emerging company
* Focus is split between managing R&D, CapEx and Commercialization
* No delays in the production/deliveries of vehicles and the construction of manufacturing facilities (AMP-2)
* Maintaining partnership with Saudi Arabia + Expanding customer base in Middle east

**5.2 Revenue**

Lucid was actually VERY optimistic about its annual total deliveries and total revenue. From the [2021 July Investor Presentation](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063) (Slide 65) : 

* Lucid forecasted an annual total delivery of 20,000 in 2022, followed by 49,000 in 2023, 90,000 in 2024, 135,000 in 2025 and 251,000 in 2026.
* In Contrast, Lucid only managed to deliver 4,300 in 2022, 6,001 in 2023 and 10,241 in 2024. 
* Similarly, Lucid forecasted a total revenue of $2,219 million in 2022, followed by $5,532 million in 2023, $9,931 million in 2024, $13,985 million in 2025 and $22,756 million in 2026
* Lucid underperformed severely and forecasted results were not met.

From the 10-K : 

* “We expect to increase our market presence in multiple geographies along with the relevant retail and service footprint across each geographic region”

My Revenue projections : 

* Lucid has about 25% of unrecognized revenue from the delivery backlog until 2024 when their deliveries finally exceed their production. AMP-1 Expansion plans were also completed in 2024.
* With an efficient manufacturing facility (AMP-1), Lucid is more capable to deliver new orders and clear delivery backlog in 2025 and 2026. Revenue grows at a base rate of 40% in 2025 and 50% in 2026. 
* Revenue jumped to 70% in 2027 because Lucid’s Midsized Platform will be ready by late 2026. Additionally, the expansion of AMP-2 should be done as well.
* Revenue after 2027 will slowly taper down as Lucid continues to fulfil their partnership with Saudi Arabia.

**5.3 Operating Margin**

From the 10-K : 

* “This vertical integration has allowed us to use decades of industry experience to achieve greater capital efficiencies, greater operational efficiencies, and consistent production quality.”
* “We anticipate that a localized supply chain, production, distribution and retail network will yield cost savings and lower carbon emissions with shorter transportation distances of products to customers.”
* “On May 24, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan intended to optimize operating expenses in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvement through a reduction in workforce. We substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan in 2024.”
* “We expect our cost per vehicle to improve in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 while ramping up production volumes. In the near term, we expect our production volume of vehicles to continue to be less than our manufacturing capacity.”

My EBIT Projections : 

* Lucid has been actively trying to be more cost efficient through not only expansion plans of AMP-1 and AMP-2 but also restructuring plans. I can expect more cost cutting to be done over the forecasted years.
* Due to the nature of Lucid as a CapEx intensive company, Lucid’s Operating Margins will remain negative unless the revenue scales fast enough. In the market for Luxury EV vehicles, I would expect Lucid to eventually achieve scalability before its Operating Margins can become positive. 
* With upcoming plans such as the CBU unit production in AMP-2, the completed key expansion plans with AMP-1 and the phase out operations at LPM-1 Plant, I forecasted Operating Margins to improve but remain negative with a rate of -130% in 2025. This will gradually improve and become positive in due time.

**5.4 Effective Tax Rate**

Unless Lucid becomes profitable, they will have a 0% effective tax rate. In the event that Lucid does generate taxable income, they have sufficient carry forward Net Operating Losses to offset future tax liability. 

**5.5 CapEx, D&A, Change in Working Capital**

From the 10-K : 

* “We anticipate our cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fiscal year 2025 to support our continued commercialization and growth objectives as we strategically invest in manufacturing capacity and capabilities, our retail studios and service center capabilities throughout North America and across the globe, development of different products and technologies, and other areas supporting the growth of Lucid’s business.”

I took a rather complex method to project these variables. Rather than just simply referring to historical data (unreliable) or simply plugging in general industry numbers, what I did was : 

* Project Net PPE/Revenue based on industry standards, then Multiply with my projected revenue to find Projected Net PPE
* To find projected CapEx (2025), I took Projected Net PPE(2025) - Net PPE (2024) + Projected D&A (2025) for example.
* To project D&A, I simply referred to historical D&A/Net PPE ratios and adjusted accordingly.
* Similarly, I used Change in working capital as a % of Revenue as a baseline to project my Change in WC.

While this method may not exactly be the most accurate or may not be your preferred way of projecting variables, it is what I could do with my given limited knowledge. 

**5.6 Reinvestment (Extra)**

I was conflicted on whether to use FCFF = EBIT(1-t) - Reinvestment or FCFF = EBIT(1- Tax Rate) − (CapEx − Depreciation) − Change in Working Capital. I decided to choose the latter even though there are more variables to project, I can cater it to LCID’s business model.

**5.7 WACC Calculation**

The published beta for Lucid is 0.89 which is absurdly low given how volatile LCID is. Using comparables from Finviz, I obtained a bottom-up beta of 1.24 which would be a better value to use but this arbitrary number does not reflect its actual volatility. If you had chosen this value, you would have gotten a COE of 10% and a WACC of 8.11%. Instead of this : 

* I just simply plugged in my desired return COE of 25% and got a WACC value of 20%.

**5.8 Cash Flow Calculation** 

Cash flows are calculated and discounted using the mid-year convention method between 24/4/2025 and 31/12/2025. 

* Conservative Case : -1.88 per share
* Base Case : -1.67 per share
* Optimistic Case : 0.41 per share

**6.0 Summary**

Bull Case

* Technological edge : Superior Powertrain technology
* Strong partnerships : Saudi Arabia (Major shareholder)
* Strong product (won awards) and management (decades of experiences) line up

Bear Case

* Significant barriers of entry in the market for luxury EV
* Lack of moat and long-term competitive advantages
* Scaling challenges and financial sustainability

Lucid motors is **overpriced relative to its peers** and **overvalued** in today’s market. So why would you still want to invest in this company?

* Choosing to invest in LCID is the belief of management’s competency in bringing this company on the same playing field as other reputable companies. 
* Is this plausible? Assuming there are no delays or obstacles, it is possible with the backing of Saudi Arabia. At the very least, Lucid does have potential to establish its brand as a luxury EV in the Middle East. 

**7.1 Final Thoughts**

Even though my DCF may or may not be COMPLETELY wrong, I think it can still serve as a guide for Lucid’s current risk and financial uncertainty.

I would love any sort of feedback/criticisms/advice on my DCF model or on my thought processes. Whether there is a clear logical flow to what I claim and my estimates. Any improvements I could make or perhaps even a different approach. I appreciate it.

I am not a god at valuation nor do I have a degree in business. While I may have some experience, I am still learning. Again, I want to reiterate that NONE of this is financial advice.

Edit : Misspelled previous CEO Peter Rawlinson (correct version) as Peter Lawrinson (incorrect). \[Rectified\]",2025-05-04,2,4
1kefze9_MS,MS,My Intrinsic and Relative valuation on LCID (Lucid Motors),"Hey there! I am looking to refine and improve my intrinsic valuation analysis. Any form of suggestions, criticism or feedback, be it on the format or the model or my thought processes will be appreciated!

This DD or intrinsic valuation will be for my own or for your ACADEMIC purpose. This is NOT financial advice.

For those who do not know what LCID is, this section will be for you. For those that already know what LCID does, and have an insatiable desire to see an amateur's DCF analysis, you should skip this section. I have included a summary at the end of this post. I will also be including a link to my DCF model below. I will be referencing the 10-K

I came across Lucid Motors (LCID) when I was using a screener to filter stocks by insider ownership. According to [Finviz.com](http://Finviz.com), LCID apparently has 60% insider ownership with a volume of 60M.

There are many other miscellaneous awards, but these are what I would consider the most important among them.

**1.5 Revenue Streams**

LCID’s revenue is STRICTLY HIGHLY dependent on product sales and the sale of regulatory credits. While Lucid motors plan on supplying and licensing their relevant technologies, eg Aston Martin partnership, it is not currently a reliable source of income. From the 10-K : 

* “We recognize revenue from vehicle sales when the customer obtains control of the vehicle, which is upon delivery.”
* “We also generate revenue from non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of battery pack systems, powertrain kits, retail merchandise, and regulatory credits.”
* “Revenue increased by $212.6 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 4,240 in deliveries of the Lucid Air vehicles and an increase of $29.1 million of regulatory credit sales, partially offset by a lower average selling price of vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.”

**1.6 Customer Base**

Majority of Lucid’s sales are in North America, followed by the Middle East (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) then other internationals.

* In 2023, 84.69% of total revenue came from NA, 9.91% from SA and 2.40% from other internationals. 
* In 2024, 74.03% of total revenue came from NA, 24.02% from SA and 1.95% from other internationals

**1.7 Business Readiness**

While Lucid’s R&D expenses have been increasing annually and there have been attempts at commercialization, Lucid’s main focus is currently on scaling.

**1.7.1 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1)**

North America’s first greenfield, purpose-built EV manufacturing, located in Arizona, expansion was made in 2024 to bring installed capacity to **90,000 vehicles per year**. From the 10-K :

* “We expect to achieve greater operational efficiencies and more consistent production quality than would be possible through outsourced manufacturing or adaptation of an existing facility.”
* “Vertical integration of manufacturing capabilities provides us the opportunity to control our technology roadmap, ensure a high degree of quality control, and improve product margins relative to an outsourced manufacturing arrangement.”
* Timeline : Phase 1 construction was completed in December 2020 with starting of production on September 28, 2021. 

**1.7.2 Advanced Manufacturing Plant-2 (AMP-2)**

* In 2022, Construction started in Saudi Arabia
* In 2023, semi knocked-down (“SKD”) assembly began, with installed annual capacity of **5,000** vehicles.
* In 2024, expansion started to enable completely-built-up (“CBU”) unit production with an additional installed annual capacity of **150,000 vehicles**.
* Late 2026: Targeted start for production of vehicles based on Lucid's Midsize platform, including higher-volume, more affordable models.
* The Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) supported the construction of AMP-2 by spending $67.3 million, $12.1 million and $33.3 million in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
* Relative to Lucid’s spending in **the two** consolidated manufacturing facilities, MISA is supporting 86%, 2.81% and 6.32% of the costs in the fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively

**2.0 Industry Overview**

With reference to the July 2021 Summer Presentation : 

* “The global luxury car market was estimated to be $495.7 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $733.2 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of \~5.0% from 2018 to 2026.”
* “With increased government mandates for electrification, combined with consumers’ growing desire for clean energy vehicles, electrification of the automotive industry is taking place globally at a rapid pace, representing 5% of all new car sales in 2020.”
* “By 2030, Lucid anticipates run-rate production of >500,000 units, representing \~4% market share of an anticipated 2030 TAM of 15mm units”

From the 10-K : 

* “The market is still nascent, with approximately 11.1% and 8.1% of new passenger vehicle sales in 2024 being battery electric vehicles worldwide and in North America, respectively (worldwide figure is an estimate from S&P Global AutoInsight, and the North America figure is an actual result from S&P Global Catalyst Registration).”

**2.1 Industry Risk**

**2.1.1 Significant Barriers to Entry**

From the 10-K :

* “The automobile industry is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing, manufacturing, and distributing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image, and the need to establish sales and service locations.”
* Lucid also competes with **long-standing established brands** and models such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz (EQ series), BMW (i7, iX), Porsche (Taycan), Audi (e-tron GT, Q8 e-tron) and etc.

**2.1.2 Supply Chain**

While Lucid is focused on in-house hardware and software innovation, and is also vertically integrated to some extent, Lucid still relies on outsourcing materials for their vehicles : 

* “We have a multi-year sourcing agreement for lithium-ion batteries, a key component of our battery system, with Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates.”
* Lucid will still be affected by current tariffs, but impacts may not be as significant as compared to other automakers who rely on outsource manufacturing.

There may be more industry risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**2.2 Company Risk**

**2.2.1 Scaling Phase**

For Lucid to achieve profitability, the revenue has to scale faster than Capital Expenditure, R&D expenses and related operating costs. 

* “We will require significant capital to develop and grow our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses”
* “In the longer term, our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability not only to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control costs on a timely basis, but also to sell in quantities and at prices sufficient to achieve our expected margins.”

There may be more company risks present but these are the ones that I deemed to be rather important.

**3.0 Competitive Advantages**

While Lucid Motors do not have a strong moat, they do have short-term competitive advantages that gives them an edge over other EV companies.

**3.1 Partnership with Saudi Arabia (Strongest Advantage)**

Lucid is Saudi Arabia’s only major partnership with a luxury EV manufacturer.

* Committed purchase of up to 100,000 vehicles over 10 years. Minimum of 50,000 vehicles.
* AMP-2 will receive funding from the Saudi government, and Lucid will be able to establish its position as a luxury EV brand in the Middle East.

**3.2 Powertrain Technology**

Outperforms Tesla and German luxury automakers 

* Lucid entered into the Strategic Technology Arrangement with Aston Martin in 2023 : Providing access to their powertrain and battery system technology to use in Aston Martin’s battery electric vehicles.

**4.0 Relative Valuation**

I would recommend referencing my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ovn4FiyW9tJqeBEUtcPFbqMsF2Z4GbkJfVGGMG7GkOU/edit?gid=1383148073#gid=1383148073) as you go through my justifications for my adjustments.

Companies Compared:

* Chinese : BYD, XPeng, Li Auto, NIO
* US : Rivian, Tesla, Lucid
* Emerging players: Zeekr, LiveWire, Lotus, Polestar

Lucid currently stands as a high-growth, high-risk player in the luxury EV space.

* Profitability margins are consistently the most negative across the table
* Trades at a premium relative to revenue, despite worse fundamentals
* Invests aggressively in innovation and manufacturing (Scaling phase)
* BYD, LI and TSLA have positive margins and trades at a discounted EV/Revenue multiple (Except TSLA)

Lucid Motors is currently **overpriced relative to its peers** based on standard valuation multiples

Cash flows are calculated and discounted using the mid-year convention method between 24/4/2025 and 31/12/2025. 

* Conservative Case : -1.88 per share
* Base Case : -1.67 per share
* Optimistic Case : 0.41 per share

**6.0 Summary**

Bull Case

* Technological edge : Superior Powertrain technology
* Strong partnerships : Saudi Arabia (Major shareholder)
* Strong product (won awards) and management (decades of experiences) line up

Bear Case

* Significant barriers of entry in the market for luxury EV
* Lack of moat and long-term competitive advantages
* Scaling challenges and financial sustainability

Lucid motors is **overpriced relative to its peers** and **overvalued** in today’s market. So why would you still want to invest in this company?

* Choosing to invest in LCID is the belief of management’s competency in bringing this company on the same playing field as other reputable companies. 
* Is this plausible? Assuming there are no delays or obstacles, it is possible with the backing of Saudi Arabia. At the very least, Lucid does have potential to establish its brand as a luxury EV in the Middle East. 

**7.1 Final Thoughts**

Even though my DCF may or may not be COMPLETELY wrong, I think it can still serve as a guide for Lucid’s current risk and financial uncertainty.

I would love any sort of feedback/criticisms/advice on my DCF model or on my thought processes. Whether there is a clear logical flow to what I claim and my estimates. Any improvements I could make or perhaps even a different approach. I appreciate it.

I am not a god at valuation nor do I have a degree in business. While I may have some experience, I am still learning. Again, I want to reiterate that NONE of this is financial advice.

1gry4g6_LCID,LCID,Lucid Motors: Value Play or Just Another EV Gamble?,"I’ve been looking into Lucid Motors (LCID) lately, trying to figure out if it’s a legit opportunity for value investors or just another EV stock riding the hype wave. The stock’s been hammered, trading way below its highs, so it *looks* like a deal—but is it really?

Here’s what I’m seeing so far:

* **Top-notch tech**: Lucid’s battery technology is seriously impressive. Their cars have the longest range in the game right now, and their focus on luxury makes them stand out compared to companies like Tesla.
* **Revenue struggles**: The sales numbers aren’t great, and they’ve had their share of production issues. Plus, their cars are super expensive, so scaling to a wider market is going to be tough unless they roll out more affordable models.
* **Cash burn is a problem**: They’re burning through money fast. Saudi Arabia’s backing is a plus, but it’s not a bottomless pit. At some point, they’ll have to stand on their own two feet financially.
* **Valuation is tricky**: On the surface, the stock seems cheap compared to where it’s been, but by traditional metrics like P/E or book value, it’s hard to call this a true “value” stock. This feels more like a long-term growth bet than a classic value play.

So, is Lucid worth a shot? Honestly, I’m not sure yet. If you believe in their tech and think they can carve out a niche in the luxury EV market, this could pay off in the long run. But right now, it’s definitely not without risk.

What do you think? Anyone else looking at Lucid as a potential buy? Let me know your take.

Seems like it's beginning to reverse, however with SI remaining high it may give more buying opportunities at cheap prices. 



Positives:

\-Lucid planning to release more vehicles, including an affordable EV at 50k sometime 2026.

\-Revenue slightly increasing every quarter instead of tumbling as it did before.

\-Strong backing by the PIF, while still remaining an American car company (tariff averse).

\-Stock price at the bottom (great buy opportunity).

Cons:

\-Currently Expensive EVs

\-Dodgy leadership by Rawlinson

\-Possibly further share dilution

\-Lots of shorts.

\-Lots of FUD (like Lee Zeldin)

Never\_Selling (aka ‘that guy’) is back with the wild watchlist updates (not wild just alliteration) you need to know about this week. Let's dive into what's been happening’ with our tick picks from last week…

# 1. $RNXT - RenovoRx Inc. - $1.23/share

**RenovoRx** has been relatively stagnant this week, floating between $1.16-$1.23/share, despite some buzz around their latest fundamental strides.What do I mean by that?  
  
Their research has been accepted for publication in the *Oncologist* journal, and their Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial is making significant strides.   
  
This biotech company's TAMP™ (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform for pancreatic cancer is showing promising potential. Stay on watch as the second interim analysis of their innovative tech is dropping soon.

# 2. $WCUFF - World Copper Ltd. - $0.08/share

Not much movement on the news front for **World Copper Ltd.** this week. Their copper mining projects in Chile continue to be the main focus, with the industry looking strong due to global demand for copper.  
  
Slow and steady outta Dub-CUFF. 

# 3. $LCID - Lucid Group Inc. - $3.46/share

**Lucid Group** is holding steady this week. With no major news drops, their strong Q1 2024 results still resonate in the market. Lucid's innovative tech and strategic partnerships, led by CEO Peter Rawlinson, keep them as a key player in the luxury EV market. Stay tuned for more as they ramp up production and delivery.

Been a crazy market week with $SPY tanking from Wednesday-Thursday, but that’s the gyst of the jawn for now.  
  
I might be a lil busy next week but if there’s any tickers y’all want a breakdown of, drop ‘em below!

129czwl_LCID,LCID,"Assigned 200 shares of $LCID, planning my next moves and seeking advice","I had 2 calls for $8 expiring 3/31 that I was swing trading, they were about breakeven so I did not sell them to avoid the commissions (I had mistakenly thought they were at $0 value and not $0 gained). I really stupidly did not understand that Fidelity auto-exercises options that are ITM, and so got assigned the 200 shares for $1,600. First, I believe this happened because I had margin enabled (this was not smart as my account size is still small; I had enabled it for some reason and decided that I could just use my cash balance around it, but now understand why I should not have enabled it in the first place). Second, I definitely plan to call Fidelity as soon as I can to sort out my cash/margin balances and make sure all is good. Third, I understand I shouldn't be trading with things I don't have full knowledge of and am going to be doing more research on this stuff for future trading. Fourth, I am taking margin off my account as soon as possible :)

At this point I am trying to make sure I lose as little money as possible, if not gain some out of the whole trade. I have a few different thoughts on what I could do moving forward. As of now I have a cash deposit being transferred and the settlement date of both the shares purchase and cash transfer are April 03, which I think should mean that they are settled properly (if anyone could shed more light on this part I would be grateful). My thoughts:

1. Sell the 200 shares as soon as I possibly can, to just settle the ordeal in the least amount of time possible. I am not sure when I am allowed to officially sell the shares without violating any policies (good faith or others) but imagine that once the shares are officially mine and are not waiting to be settled that I'll be able to sell them or do whatever I'd like as they are normal shares.

2. Keep the 200 shares for -$1,600 and start selling calls to reap some premium as well as set myself up for a locked in gain if the shares get called away at the higher price. I have considered selling ITM calls for the high premium, and I think if I am doing the math right that I should make out positive (or really close to breakeven) if the shares were called away at those ITM strikes. It also appears that theoretically speaking I could cover the original purchase with about 5-10 weeks of selling weekly OTM calls, presuming the strike is never hit and the prices of the OTM contracts remain around $1.00-$1.50. 

3. Option 3 would be a mix of the 2, I'd plan to sell 100 shares immediately to cover ~half the transaction and reduce my position size. Then start selling calls on the remaining 100 to gather premium and possibly have the shares called away.

Some things to note: I understand that contracts are for 100 shares, so when I say selling calls I do understand that I shouldn't sell more than 1 call for every 100 shares owned, lest I want to face the possibility of an even bigger margin call! I'm not necessarily desperate for the $1,600 to be right back in my account, but the suddenness of it was a surprise to me so I am wanting quick action to plan on not losing a lot of that very quickly.

Some questions I have are: if I sold the ITM calls, how readily should I expect those shares to be called away? I'm curious if I could plan on having them called away within some certainty or if there is any sort of metric to determine the chances that the shares would be called away. Does the above situation sound like it will incur any violations on the account?

Generally wondering here too what the real big downsides are, is there anything about this situation that would impact me negatively beyond the $1,600 purchase price of the shares? I of course understand the risk in owning any shares of a stock, so I'll be riding out the price action of the 200 shares until I get rid of them. I believe the cash deposit will cover the shares purchased, and beyond having that cash invested in the shares for the time being I otherwise am not overly worried about it.

LCID as a company seems OK, however I'm not sure if their recent history will bode very well for their shorter term future. I'm going to dig into their fundamentals to try to decide if I'd like to be a long term owner. As for the money side of it, I think I would prefer to have a good portion back into cash so I can worry less on it, so I may aim to sell 100 shares soon and start selling calls on the remaining position. If anybody has any thoughts on LCID as a company overall I am definitely open to hearing them, good, bad, or ugly!

Again, I do plan to call Fidelity when I can to ask them my questions directly, so that I understand what moves I can and should make moving forward. If you have any insights to this scenario and these questions I would love to hear some thoughts, I'd appreciate anything you have to share. Thanks for reading theough this, take care and happy trading!

TL;DR: got assigned 200 LCID shares for $1,600; trying to plan next moves for least loss or even some gain. Would like to sell 100 shares and keep 100, then sell weekly calls on those remaining to reap premium and possibly have shares called away at favorable price. Wondering if I can expect shares to be called away. DON'T MESS WITH OPTIONS AND/OR MARGIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS OR POSSIBILITIES.",2023-04-02,3,42

119wzw8_LCID,LCID,Is Lucid Motors a buy," Luxury EV maker Lucid Group Inc announced on February 22, 2023, that it expects to produce 9,000 to 14,000 of its luxury electric vehicles this year, up from 7,180 cars produced last year. This is below the average analyst expectation of 21,815 cars, according to Visible Alpha. Lucid's Q4 2022 revenue was $257.7 million, which is an increase from $26.4 million the previous year, but still fell short of analysts' predictions of $302.6 million. However, Lucid's net loss decreased significantly from the previous year, standing at $472.6 million or 28 cents per share, compared with $1.05 billion or 64 cents per share the year before. The company's fourth-quarter revenue missed Wall Street's expectations, with fewer cars delivered than produced. It has been difficult for the luxury EV maker to compete in the market due to the price war initiated by Tesla Inc and Ford Motor Co, which has made it harder for Lucid and other competitors such as Rivian Automotive Inc to gain market share.",2023-02-23,3,14

10o0zik_LCID,LCID,A theory of how PIF wanted to play LCID acquisition - but was sabotaged,"First, let’s establish a few things:
1. Lucid, although losing money, possesses impressive technology and a lot of potential
2. PIF would love to own that potential 

So let’s assume the buyout rumor was true - at least they wish to do that. Then let’s look back - what happened?

1. Lucid was given a $5 price target by Morgan Stanley.
2. Then we know that JP Morgan might be helping PIF to buy out Lucid

So one possibility is that PIF has been working with the big banks to
1. Artificially suppress the price of Lucid, with fear, with low price targets and possibly with shorting
2. PIF can swoop in and make an offer of, let’s say, $13 and still look pretty generous.

But someone was not happy with this scheme and decided to expose this. And voila - people piled in and LCID shot up, making the acquisition more difficult.

Just a theory. I know nothing that you don’t know.

Also: my plan is to buy 200 shares at open on Monday. I don’t think PIF will pay anything less than $12.5 so in my book the risk is pretty minimal at this point (current price 12.29).

NIO seemed to just be a way for a holding company to generate cash for a China backed startup, a shell company really.  LCID on the other hand does hold assets.  Both of these companies are backed by governments.  Is China (or their uber rich) really going to let NIO go bankrupt?

I tried to tell you guys weeks ago!","Smart investors need to learn from the anticipated value of earnings. whether it is good news or bad news the ending results reflect not the company's inherent value but the economy as a whole and its place in it. Meaning most companies reporting earnings are doomed to drop in price after hours and the following day.

Take LCID as an example for this week. This evening 11/08/2022 after the market closed LCID earnings were released. They posted a less than great earnings last quarter. After hours, the stock price dips. What does this tell us? Well, you can look at some facts. This economic environment is heading toward a consensus of a recession. Meaning most 9-5 people collectively think a recession is coming. Posting good or bad earnings no longer guarantees stock will rise, in fact, it almost always means it will fall in this specific economic market. This brings us to my point about the inherent value of the company, this idea ties more to the macro effects of the economy on stock prices.

Earnings may in fact be a sentence to have negative stock movement. Pay close attention to what earnings are on the horizon. Things are going to be bumpy. None of this is financial advice.

For roughly 15 years, Tesla and Lucid Motors have been waging an exciting battle for supremacy in an electric vehicle industry with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake.

Now, you can watch their cars literally race past one another at insane speeds on a quarter-mile strip of pavement.

DragTimes, a popular YouTube channel, recently staged such a race between the Lucid Air Dream Edition and Tesla’s Model S Plaid. Both cars are their company’s highest-performance sedans, meaning they each offer exceptional horsepower.

To see if Lucid is a good stock to invest

They delivered cars last year

Gave a few bears with puts some tears

Got up all the way to sixty a share

But again out come all the bears

Talkin' bout the Saudi money that was invested

Sayin' that on the 19th it's going to be divested

The truth is that the Saudis once sold too soon

When they sold Tesla before it had a chance to moon

So the idea that the Saudi's are going to be fooled twice

Really isn't smart let alone nice

That's why I bought some calls for this week and next

And when they make money I'll be ready to flex

If you've read this far

In my book, you're a star

Whether you are an ape or eat crayons

Or your wife's boyfriend is a tranny named Rayon

Do your own DD cuz I'm not a financial advisor

The lessons we learn in life make us wiser

But if I was you, and thank God I am not

Be grateful you're not a WSB bot

Go all in on Lucid this might be your last chance

To get in early before the start of the dance

Buy some calls, buy some shares, so you can buy an Audi

Then take your wife back from her boyfriend and get naughty

And unlike Jamal Khashoggi

This time I promise you can trust the Saudis

MotorTrend Car of The Year, Increased Productions going into 2022, over 500 Miles on a single charge.. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson doesn't ""want to be doing wealthy people's cars,"" he told ""Axios on HBO"" in an interview that aired Sunday.   Americans are warming up to the idea of electric cars, but the purchase price is still too high for many people, who also worry about how far their car will go before the battery needs recharging. 

The company is a Long-term Good investment and Buying Under $40 which is a a Resistant support level to $45, $47, $50... **in 6 Months I see $275 easily**  the market will be opening up to the everyday Jack - the $25K consumer purchase... They have delivered on everything they promised. The Air is an extremely well-built product. It gets the range. They said it has the performance they promise. All of that's great. Really of this cohort of EV start-ups, I'd probably ranked Lucid at the top for execution so far. Again, my question is, ultimately, what's it worth? How many of these Lucid Airs that they're going to sell? 

In the last 3 months, **3 ranked analysts** set 12-month price targets for **LCID**. The average price target among the analysts is **$44.33**.

raturi_LCID,LCID,RIVN and LCID are 100-billion-dollar meme stocks and their share prices will sink harder than Cathie's ARK,"RIVN and LCID make TSLA look like a value stock, and it is a complete fucking joke.

I get it. RIVN and LCID make nice cars. Quality. Award-worthy. High price targets from shill, delusional analysts. 

Don't fucking forget: RIVN and LCID are **STARTUPS**. They are not profitable and have little or zero revenue. THEY AREN'T EVEN SOFTWARE STARTUPS. Meaning, their margins will be shit for a long, long time. Inflation will squeeze their margins too. All of this is assuming they can ever scale production. 

Do you know how hard it is to build a successful car company against entrenched titans? It took one of the world's greatest serial entrepreneurs **ever**, a Benjamin Franklin, a Henry Ford of our time, a devout technologist and futurist, almost TWO DECADES to achieve profitability with a car company. Tesla delivered their first cars (the Roadster) in 2008, **13 years ago**. The EV market had green pastures at the time. 

With sky-high operational costs to scale, LCID and RIVN won't be profitable for several years, and they will have to rely on share issuance to fund capex and operations, diluting existing shareholders. They will be competing with the old titans and the new. If their share price tanks and aren't able to raise capital because their sector has fallen out of favor, they will be completely fucked. **The most likely 10-year outcome for RIVN and LCID is bankruptcy.** 

Years from now, people will say, why the fuck did people in 2021 not see they were peak bubble when RIVN IPO'd with zero revenue and a valuation of 150B? The truth is, bears, bulls, and observers all have become numb to obscene valuations this year. Some are starting to wake up to a harsh reality, but the EV tickers are still floating on cloud 9, blissfully ignorant to the bloodbath ahead. That's why I feel this trade isn't crowded yet, not in the slightest. 

IV is super high, but given how far overstretched these companies are, it doesn't even fucking matter, because I truly believe they will lose 80-90% of their market cap. Pidgey JPow has evolved into Pidgeotto JPow, swaths of the speculative markets have rolled over, macro fundamentals are terrible, and this absurdity cannot continue for long. LCID will go to the way of SPCE... just a few months later. Looking for 10-baggers with these positions:

* RIVN March 22 55p

qywkqu_LCID,LCID,Whose the main demographic for LCID?,"Real talk. Whose the main demographic for LCID?? 

Like most youths want to be driving what their favorite basketball player or musician is driving… I don’t think you’ll be hearing rappers singing about driving their Lucid down boulevard with two baddies in the back. 

And I don’t think major celebrities will be getting behind this vehicle since it’s doesn’t have much a status symbol like a BMW, Mercedes, porche, etc. does 

And if you’re a playboy, you would much prefer a lambo or a Ferrari 

And if you’re in the ultra rich category that absolute loves a well finished vehicle, you would buy a rolls Royce 

And if you’re in the lower class, you won’t be able to afford the 100k price tag on the lucid, so you’re opting for a Toyota or a Honda 

And if you’re in the middle class / working class, you’ll probably still on a budget that’s under 100k. So you’ll be looking for something that is more functional for work and family, like a truck or an SUV

If you’re a EV enthusiast / purist straight to the core, you’ll go for a Tesla

And if you’re a foreigner, like Chinese or Korean, you’ll gravitate naturally towards a bmw, Mercedes, or a Tesla (I know because I’m Asian). 

So with all that said, the only crowd that I can think of is old people. Old people who are disconnected with trends and disconnected with social statuses, who doesn’t care about all the things mentioned above. Old people, who are already retired and have 100k. 

Sure they won motor cars of the year, but do you know who won the last two years? It was Kia, and you don’t see people screaming and celebrating that fact. And frankly, I still don’t see many kia’s on the road. 

It’s funny that they have a model called the ‘dream’, but I don’t think this is anyone’s dream car…

qz0lt4_LCID,LCID,Puts on $LCID?,"Hey guys! I just broke down some stuff on LCID to see how much growth is being priced in and if there is any money to be made. Firstly LCID is expecting to deliver only 500 vehicles this year and is still trading at a 90billion dollar valuation. If we take a very bullish estimate on the stock we can expect the company to deliver about 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles by 2025. If we also factor in a decent expense ratio of 80%( which is about 10% higher than Tesla) and give it a big P/E ratio of about 100x we see that in 2025 the share price comes out to anywhere from about $21- 45$. 

I used a spreadsheet for this data and priced in every thing I could

So should we buy Puts on $LCID. This valuation seems outrageous even over the long term",2021-11-21,54,72

RIvean had its IPO and was listed last week, and now is trading at a market cap of $140 billion. They don’t have any sales, but Amazon owns around 20% of the stock, and put in an order for 100k electric trucks. They also plan to produce electric pickups, and Ford is in on the owners side ( to grab technology? ). The price is a bit more than doubled from the IPO price last week.

Lucid did an IPO earlier this year, and did Q3 yesterday. They have a market cap of $75 billion, and sits on all time high forming a double top. They just started deliveries, and have a production goal for 20k cars next year, and reservations for 17k. Saudi pension fun is in on the owner side. They had earnings yesterday and spiked on eps -0.46 against expected -0.23.

It seems like green is where the market wants to put all its money.

They have delivered well over 20,000 vehicles so far, and they are projected to have a revenue of $1.6B this year.

That’s BEFORE the release of the Polestar 3, their new SUV which will be “made in the USA” in Ridgeville, NC, as well as their 4th model which is the Polestar Precept. It is a full-size electric sedan comparable to an S-Class or the Lucid Air in size:

Guggenheim Partners is a massive investment bank with over $250B AUM. They are well-known within the industry with a great reputation. Ever heard of the Guggenheim Museum for modern art in New York? They belong to the big boys club.

**Upside:**

I am pretty sure you guys know that LCID is trading at $44B and Rivian is looking to IPO at $80B this year. Together they have delivered 0 vehicles to their customers, Polestar is going public at $20B at $10 per share. You can do your own math but I am pretty confident a 50% upside or $30B marketcap are realistic for this company.

I was an investor in CCIV/LCID and now I am in GGPI/Polestar. Both companies offer exceptionally great returns IMO but GGPI at $10.30 and 20B market-cap seems to be a lot cheaper at the moment. I am not saying Polestar is better than Lucid, just that it might be a better investment at the current price. Lucid's tech is outstanding but Polestar also has a lot going for them!

pu1adi_LCID,LCID,I valued NASDAQ:LCID at $9.2b - 345% overvalued. Analysis summary and link below,"**Article:** [https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-lcid/lucid-group/news/calculating-the-intrinsic-value-for-lucid-group-incs-nasdaql](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-lcid/lucid-group/news/calculating-the-intrinsic-value-for-lucid-group-incs-nasdaql)

**TLDR:**

Estimates that are based on the [company presentation](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063) , I see the company potentially having this intrinsic value:

* Present Value of Free Cash Flows to the Firm (10yr model): US$-845.9m
* Present Value of Terminal Value: US$9.9b
* **Intrinsic Value of Equity in Common Stock: US$9.2b / $5.6 per share**
* Current Market Capitalization: US$40.9b / $25.5 per share
* Overvalued by 345%

This shouldn't be too surprising as the company is involved in a capital intense business and is relatively young. The intrinsic value will keep rising as Lucid expands sales and operations.

**There are many things that are flawed with a DCF approach, and different analysts will almost always come up with different estimates** , but if we want to test out a few variants, we can hold everything constant and just change the projected revenues in order to see how the company value changes.

This is a form of sensitivity analysis and will help investors see what the intrinsic value is for different rates of success:

* Variant A: With end revenues of US$25b, we get an intrinsic value of US$18b, (128% overvalued)
* Variant B: With end revenues of US$40b, we get an intrinsic value of US$27b, (48% overvalued)
* **Variant C: With end revenues of US$60b, we get an intrinsic value of US$43b, (4% undervalued)**

Alternatively we can also assume a higher profitability to reflect the luxury market, and instead of 8.8% EBIT margin we can test out 10% and 12% margins ( *keep in mind that this is quite optimistic* ).

* Variant A1: With end revenues of US$25b & **10%** EBIT margin, we get an intrinsic value of US$21b, (94% overvalued)
* Variant A2: With end revenues of US$25b & **12%** EBIT margin, we get an intrinsic value of US$26.7b, (54% overvalued)
* Variant B1: With end revenues of US$40b & **10%** EBIT margin, we get an intrinsic value of US$33b, (24% overvalued)
* *Variant B2: With end revenues of US$40b &* ***12%*** *EBIT margin, we get an intrinsic value of US$41.9b, (1% undervalued)*

**The last variant is effectively what management is promising shareholders.**

Hopefully, this gives investors some clarity as to how much performance they need from management in order to justify current prices. Anything above, should be indicative of future upside on the stock.",2021-09-23,3,4

* SOFI mentions soared today after the stock price provided solid returns to shareholders today, up 11% for the day.
* SDC momentum is carrying over from the last couple weeks. This seems to be the next ""short-squeeze"" stock you folks like.
* BB took off after-hours and was up 11% at one point, but is now up 6%.
* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

Here's the data of ticker mentions throughout the day, visualized. We can see the exact moment BB took off after-hours and when SOFI reall started to pick up momentum.

Both companies have a market cap in the 30-35 billion range so valuation is almost identical.

Xpeng has significant growth in sales year over year and is selling like 7-8k vehicles a month currently vs Lucid whom is pre production.

Xpeng has their new P5 releasing this month starting at 25k which should help penetrate more of the market.

Xpeng has more data and self driving software/hardware experience.

I guess the argument would be Lucid could potentially have a better driving experience with more range for their batteries but you are paying like 5-6x more for a Lucid than an Xpeng.  Also maybe people are weary of Xpeng being in China which has pros and cons.

What does everyone think? I am considering buying some leaps for Xpeng with them looking to double production capacity for 2022 and releasing their P5 model which would appeal to a huge part of the market.",2021-09-03,6,34

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

https://preview.redd.it/58e0bwpkkcj71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c430e6b2db149da642c7e62784b7990523dbbb2d

https://preview.redd.it/m25tqedmkcj71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50a1d0566d8ff6872f588de307ce5a41a33870f

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/rlbjwa1okcj71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1292576948128353dacebbbb24686bb98cb6c2

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

[\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*](https://preview.redd.it/fsgu9uhpkcj71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cabbf7c21f7a9aeb8790fb65b7d5e5d53b664d)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/i728mi0rkcj71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bcf294372eb8ca630905dabc87ce31d1e3d181)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

https://preview.redd.it/rnl4utvskcj71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=668d97028ea2ccb95a11d1a8c3c4cf476aa56f93

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*|18.33\*|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.81\*|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*|12.7\*|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\*|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

oss4my_LCID,LCID,Why PIPEs won't sell off all their LCID shares upon lockup expiration,"PIPE (private investment in public equities) invested aggregate $2.5B in Lucid Group at $15 per share and received 166M shares (\~10.5% ownership). The PIPE offering was oversubscribed at the time of the offer (Since LCID was trading in $50s / $60s), meaning the number of interested parties and offered capital to invest in Lucid far exceeded what was needed at the time. Ultimately 7 large institutions together provided $2.5B and Saudi's PIF was one of those 7 institutions. Saudis were already a large shareholder of Lucid and they had the final word which institutions can finally take part in the PIPE offering. Meanwhile they also took part in the PIPE offering to increase their stake and assure the chosen institutions how sweet they believed $15 offering was. The 7 institutions are:

\- Blackrock

\- Fidelity

\- Saudi PIF ($200M)

\- Franklin Templeton

\- Neuberger Berman

\- Wellington Asset Management

\- Winslow Capital Management

In February after DA, Peter Rawlinson and head of PIF both emphasized that **PIPE investors have ""implied"" long-term capital commitment.** The definition of ""Long Term"" for them is not clear for us, but I doubt they would consider a few months as ""long term"". It appears they meant PIPE investors will **NOT** sell the shares and run away after a few month or even a year. Let's not forget these large institutions were "" privileged"" to be included in the $15 offering. I believe the Saudi's PIF criteria for choosing a handful of institutions to take part in the offering (among too many interested parties) should have been:

**1- Relationship:** Wall St and the world of finance is all about relationship. The clients pick you due to the relatio0nship and if your client is a sovereign wealth fund (PIF) that controls $800B reserves, losing your relationship is the last thing you want. Many of these asset management firms earn fees by AUM. If your $800B client throws you a fish (PIPE opportunity at $15) and they expect your *""long term capital commitment""*, then you definitely ask their advice before selling shares after lockup expiration. Remember that every $1 this stock falls, the PIF loses $1B. If the PIPE sell off triggers a big meltdown, it severely damages their client (PIF). In Wall St, losing or souring your relationship with such a big client is the last thing you want. Being a go-to financial firm for such a large client (PIF) means earning hefty fees (Asset management fees, advisory fees, capital market fees) indefinitely into the future.

**2- Size**  Most of these institutions are Wall St giants. Blackrock AUM is over $9T as of Q2'2021. Blackrock equates Wall St for many of the firms in the finance world. Larry Fink is seen as the strongest man on Wall St. Let's assume Blackrock, as one of the seven PIPE investors, invested $300M at $15 and by lockup expiration date the price is $45. They will have $600M gain. This gain looks huge for retail investors, but it is not huge enough for a company at the size of Blackrock, specifically if:

\- It leads to losing PIF or imposing loss on the PIF (Remember Lucid is Saudi PIF's most successful investment so far). Losing PIF means losing billions of dollars of fees that can be earned indefinitely in the future.

\- If Blackrock believes Lucid can grow even further in the future (+4 years)

\- If Blackrock requires higher ROI on their Lucid investment.

**3- Strength:** The institutions chosen are among the strongest asset management firms on Wall St. They were  chosen and they won the competition, however that winning should have come with strings attached to it. Expectation of long-term capital commitment is one of those.

Considering all the factors above, we don't have an easy guess about the behavior of the PIPE investors after lockup expiration. Once the lock up expires, they gain the ability to sell, however will they dump all the shares and run away? **Likely not.**

Last but not the least, the PIPE deal has put them in an ""enviable position"" among investors, since February many institutions and retail investors wish (and futilely wait) to buy LCID at $15 per share. Remember that many short squeeze scenarios have happened at lockup expirations due to massive bets against the stock leading to the lockup expiration date, due to the anticipated large sell-off, and the sell off not being materialized (i.e when investors don't sell upon lockup expiration).

oqpuk4_LCID,LCID,Lucid Motors will trade under ticker $LCID starting monday 26/7,"Lucid Motors (Lucid Group) will finally trade under its own ticker $LCID, starting monday 26/7 (July 26) after a successful merge yesterday. What do you guys think about the stock and business? Let’s have a discussion about Lucid Motors.

Quick info:
Lucid Motors is an American electric vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Newark, California. Lucid’s other divisions include energy storage, and original equipment manufacturing.

The company was founded in 2007 under the name Atieva. Originally it was focused on building electric vehicle batteries and powertrains for other vehicle manufacturers. It is now the first EV manufacturer to hit +500 mile range with their first car Lucid Air.

Lucid Air Pure - $69,900 / 480 hp / 406 mi range

Lucid Air Touring - $87,500 / 620 hp /  406 mi range

Lucid Air Grand Touring - $131,500 / 800 hp / 517 mi range

Lucid Air Dream Edition - $161,500 / 1080 hp / 503 mi range

My two cents:
The EV market is certainly competitive but this is not much of a concern for Lucid Motors considering they are targeting the high-end and luxury segment of the EV market. They offer the longest range, I think that fact alone should tempt a lot of people to purchase the car. That along with a beautiful design (imo) and a max power of 1080 hp makes the car tick a lot of boxes for potential car buyers. Lucid Motors is heavily backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), currently having $5bn cash on hand which is enough for several years to come. Saudi Arabia sees Lucid Motors as an important investment no doubt, considering their oil reserves are going to dry up eventually and they have to look for new opportunities and investments. They simply won’t let Lucid fail, that is my belief.

My current position is 1700 shares at $19 (DCA since Jan 11)",2021-07-24,995,638

nl346b_LCID,LCID,CCIV changing to LCID. How will it affect options?,"I have calls on CCIV for 21 Jan 22. They are switching to LCID soon, and I believe it's something like 100 cciv shares will be roughly 60 shares of LCID afterwards. 

What does that mean for the calls? 

The price of the shares should rise, so they equal the same amount of money, but you own less shares. 

If the calls are $35 strike, and the price goes from 25-35 during the name change/share consolidation, will the prices of my original calls also shift to reflect the merger, or will my original order price stay the same and I can cash out ITM? 

I'm trying to wrap my head around how that would work, and see what to look out for when that all happens.

My dumb smooth brain doesn't know why the crayons taste bad, but I'm still eating them.


Edit: I threw out arbitrary numbers. https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-040368/ states that it could be that 1 share of cciv= 2 of lucid.

So either way, how does that affect the options?",2021-05-25,11,5
