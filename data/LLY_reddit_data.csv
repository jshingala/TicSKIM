1kxklnd_LLY,LLY,Eli Lilly: Time To Buy?,"Thinking of buying into Eli Lilly (LLY)? Skyrocketing sales from Mounjaro & Zepbound are just the start. They're also making huge bets on Alzheimer's (Kisunla recently got FDA & Aussie approval), cancer (new PI3Kα inhibitor acquisition), and an oral weight-loss pill (orforglipron showing promise).  

They're pouring billions into new US manufacturing ($50B since 2020) and R&D, including AI partnerships. Q1 2025 saw revenues jump 45% to $12.7B, and they're guiding $58-$61B for the full year. Balance sheet shows rising debt to fuel this growth (around $38.6B), but also positive Q1 free cash flow and strong future growth forecasts (analysts see \~22.5% earnings growth).

1k1chjd_LLY,LLY,Eli Lilly Soars 14% in Pre-Market After Weight-Loss Pill Results Rival Ozempic’s,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lilly-soars-weight-loss-pill-115533510.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lilly-soars-weight-loss-pill-115533510.html)

(Bloomberg) — Eli Lilly ([LLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LLY)) & Co. shares surged after data showed its experimental weight-loss pill worked as well as the Ozempic shot, bringing it one step closer to developing a needle-free alternative to injections.

The trial is one of several that Lilly is running to test the drug, called orforglipron, in diabetes, obesity and other related conditions like sleep apnea. Investors and analysts had expected it to work at least as well as Ozempic, the blockbuster diabetes shot from Novo Nordisk ([NVO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVO)) A/S.

The trial showed patients lost 16 lbs, or 7.9% of their body weight. That compares favorably with Ozempic, where diabetic patients on the highest dose lost roughly 6% of their body weight. Lilly said patients hadn’t yet reached a weight plateau at the time the study ended, indicating that patients might lose more weight. The pill lowered blood sugar levels by an average of 1.3%. Ozempic lowered blood sugar levels by 2.1%.

Lilly’s shares rose as much as 14% in premarket trading in New York. Novo US-listed shares fell 3.9% following Lilly’s data. Hims & Hers ([HIMS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMS)) Health Inc., which makes a compounded version of weight-loss shots, dropped 7.6%.

Recent setbacks from Pfizer ([PFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE)) Inc. and disappointing results from Novo have made Lilly’s studies some of the most anticipated of the year. The company’s main obesity trial won’t wrap until at least July, according to a clinical trial database.

Orforglipron could cement Lilly’s lead in the obesity drug market, which is expected to reach $130 billion by the end of the decade. Novo was first to market with Saxenda and then Wegovy, but Lilly has quickly closed the gap. Now, the company appears to be pulling ahead of its Danish rival to develop the next blockbuster weight-loss treatment.

Lilly expects to submit orforglipron for weight management to regulators by the end of this year with the submission for type 2 diabetes anticipated to come in 2026, the company said in a statement.

Weight-loss shots made by Novo and Lilly have been wildly popular, generating billions of dollars in sales. But drugs than can be taken by mouth, rather than injected, are considered the next frontier. It’s lured companies like Pfizer and AstraZeneca Plc to try to develop their own weight-loss pills, with varying degrees of success.

The data looks competitive from an efficacy point of view, with no apparent safety signals, “supporting potential blockbuster status,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s John Murphy in a note. The results were toward the top-end of expectations and the limited safety data suggest good tolerability with no liver signals, he said.

“You see patients that may have the preference to starting an oral medication rather than an injectable; not only in the US, but there are many outside of US markets that are heavy into orals versus injectables,” Lilly’s Chief Financial Officer Lucas Montarce said at the Leerink Global Healthcare Conference in Miami earlier this year.

Lilly is confident that if orforglipron is approved it will be able to launch worldwide without supply constraints.

# Diabetes study

Patients with diabetes typically have a harder time shedding pounds, so Lilly executives have warned that results from this trial shouldn’t be used to directly assess the drug’s weight-loss potential.

“Based on prior studies of orforglipron, as well as other GLP-1 therapies, we expect weight loss in people with diabetes to be significantly less than in people living with obesity who do not have diabetes,” Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said on an earnings call.

The safety profile of the pill was consistent with the GLP-1 class, said Lilly. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal issues which were “generally mild to moderate in severity,” the company said. Treatment discontinuation rates were 8% at the highest dose and 6% at the lowest one.

I've been researching both of these companies and would like to hear some opinions from others.

NVO seems like the better company in terms of value, but LLY appears to have a broader portfolio of products, which makes me think their competitive advantage might be stronger.

1. Do you think LLY has a stronger competitive advantage?
2. Do you believe both companies have a strong competitive advantage?

Both companies seem very similar, which makes me wonder why LLY is valued so much higher than NVO. The only reasons I can think of are that LLY is an American company and focuses on a broader range of therapeutic areas. However, these factors don’t seem enough to justify such a significantly higher valuation compared to NVO.

I currently think NVO is the better company and investment.

What are your thoughts? Is LLY's higher valuation justified? Also, do you think investing in either of these companies is a good way to diversify into the medical sector?

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet’s favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year’s $7.4 million loss. 

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March—a huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What’s fueling Reddit’s rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit’s huge traffic into ad dollars. 

Meanwhile, Reddit’s data has become gold in the AI world—Google and OpenAI now license Reddit’s data to train their AI models, helping drive “other revenue” up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit’s user base is growing, too. 

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit’s new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts. 

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet’s quirky corner—it’s a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit’s steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media. 

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that’s no small feat.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 💻 **Microsoft** shares ticked down 3.60% post-earnings after reporting Q3 revenue of $65.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street's $64.5 billion estimate. Profits also beat, coming in at $3.30 per share. AI contributed 12 points to Azure’s 34% growth, though data center limitations held back further gains. Meanwhile, rising AI-driven demand in its Office products and Bing boosted search ad revenue by 19% ($MSFT). 
* 📱**Meta** shares slipped slightly 3.06% after Q3 results showed $40.6 billion in revenue, a 19% increase year-over-year, beating Wall Street’s $40.3 billion target. Reality Labs, Meta’s AI and augmented reality arm, reported a $4.4 billion loss, as Zuckerberg aims to keep AI investments rolling. The company’s ad-targeting improvements, however, bolstered engagement, even as Wall Street questions the returns on its AI and AR bets ($META). 
* 💊 **Eli Lilly** dropped 6.28% after its weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro came up $900 million short of expectations, attributed to inventory issues. Q3 revenue was $11.4 billion, below analysts’ $12.2 billion projection, and full-year guidance was cut by $600 million. Despite supply-chain fixes, analysts worry about demand as compounded drugs gain ground, posing a potential risk to Lilly’s future sales ($LLY). 
* ☕ **Starbucks** is undergoing a major strategy shift under new CEO Brian Niccol, who aims to reverse a 7% drop in Q4 same-store sales.

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet’s favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year’s $7.4 million loss. 

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March—a huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What’s fueling Reddit’s rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit’s huge traffic into ad dollars. 

Meanwhile, Reddit’s data has become gold in the AI world—Google and OpenAI now license Reddit’s data to train their AI models, helping drive “other revenue” up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit’s user base is growing, too. 

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit’s new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts. 

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet’s quirky corner—it’s a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit’s steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media. 

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that’s no small feat.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 💻 **Microsoft** shares ticked down 3.60% post-earnings after reporting Q3 revenue of $65.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street's $64.5 billion estimate. Profits also beat, coming in at $3.30 per share. AI contributed 12 points to Azure’s 34% growth, though data center limitations held back further gains. Meanwhile, rising AI-driven demand in its Office products and Bing boosted search ad revenue by 19% ($MSFT). 
* 📱**Meta** shares slipped slightly 3.06% after Q3 results showed $40.6 billion in revenue, a 19% increase year-over-year, beating Wall Street’s $40.3 billion target. Reality Labs, Meta’s AI and augmented reality arm, reported a $4.4 billion loss, as Zuckerberg aims to keep AI investments rolling. The company’s ad-targeting improvements, however, bolstered engagement, even as Wall Street questions the returns on its AI and AR bets ($META). 
* 💊 **Eli Lilly** dropped 6.28% after its weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro came up $900 million short of expectations, attributed to inventory issues. Q3 revenue was $11.4 billion, below analysts’ $12.2 billion projection, and full-year guidance was cut by $600 million. Despite supply-chain fixes, analysts worry about demand as compounded drugs gain ground, posing a potential risk to Lilly’s future sales ($LLY). 
* ☕ **Starbucks** is undergoing a major strategy shift under new CEO Brian Niccol, who aims to reverse a 7% drop in Q4 same-store sales. Shares are up slightly since his hire, but challenges remain as Niccol plans to simplify Starbucks’ menu and refine mobile ordering. Investors await insights on how Niccol will drive growth in key markets, especially China, where the chain faces a tough competitive landscape ($SBUX). 
* 📉 **Robinhood** sank 11.38% in after-hours after Q3 net revenue of $637 million fell below the expected $663.5 million. A costly customer promotion, which offset revenue by $27 million, impacted the bottom line despite robust user growth in new products like crypto and futures trading. The company aims to attract more mature investors with recent expansions but faces challenges in turning promotional spending into sustainable revenue ($HOOD).

# Tomorrow

PCE is the inflation metric everyone’s watching—especially the Fed. Core PCE, the central bank’s go-to gauge, could tip the scales toward rate cuts if tomorrow’s reading stays low. All eyes will be on the data as it rolls in.

Initial jobless claims offer a weekly pulse on the labor market, though recent hurricanes might muddy the numbers a bit. Thankfully, the latest figures have held steady, keeping any labor market jitters at bay..

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** took a beating in late September after a harsh report from short-seller Hindenburg Research. If the company manages to counter these claims, it could become a prime buying opportunity, given its rapid growth, strong cash reserves, and a young, expanding user base. Analysts expect a -$0.39 EPS on $1.02 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

* **Amazon** still rules online retail, but all eyes are on its cloud segment, AWS, now a major revenue machine. With heavy investments in AI, AWS is primed for growth, though costs are a concern.

1f2k3zb_LLY,LLY,Eli Lilly Halves Zepbound Price In New Version Of Weight-Loss Drug,"Eli Lilly and Company ( LLY ) has launched a new dosage form of its weight-loss drug Zepbound at roughly half the price of its traditional price, aiming to reach more patients who don't have health insurance while also fighting off generics.

Eli Lilly will offer 2.5 mg and 5 mg single-dose Zepbound through its Web site at a monthly cost of $399 and $549, respectively. By comparison, the list price without insurance and discounts is about $1,000 per month.



Patients will need to self-inject using the new Zepbound syringe. The current version uses a single-dose auto-injector pen, which allows patients to inject directly under the skin with the touch of a button.



Eli Lilly says the vials are easier to manufacture than auto-injector pens, so they will increase the availability of Zepbound. While the lower cost may drive down Lilly's average Zepbound sales price in the short term, the additional sales of the vials “could have a positive impact on Lilly's sales results.”

Lilly's announcement on Zepbound's cardiovascular benefits comes on the heels of a recent study that found that a group of obese patients using Lilly's Mounjaro (the core ingredient in Tirzepatide), a drug that combines weight loss with diabetes treatment, had a more favorable outcome than a group using Novo Nordisk's Ozempic (the core ingredient in Ozempic), a drug that combines both weight loss and diabetes treatment. Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment, showed significantly more weight loss than the group of obese patients using Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment.

A Goldman Sachs forecast shows that the global anti-obesity drug market could grow to around $130 billion in annual sales by 2030, compared with just $6 billion earlier in 2023. The World Obesity Federation (WOF) predicts that by 2035, more than 4 billion people (more than half the size of the world's population) could be suffering from varying degrees of obesity.",2024-08-27,41,11

# Weight-Loss Wars: Novo Nordisk vs. Eli Lilly

# Novo’s Pricey Problem

Novo Nordisk ($NVO), the Danish pharma titan behind the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy (prescribed for weight loss) and Ozempic (prescribed for type 2 diabetes), just had a rare misstep. Despite soaring demand, Wegovy’s sales in the latest quarter came in at a disappointing $1.7 billion—falling short of the $2 billion that analysts had penciled in. The culprit? Higher-than-expected price concessions to US pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who hold the keys to market access. This squeeze has left investors uneasy, especially as rival Eli Lilly ($LLY) muscles in with its competing drug, Zepbound.

Novo’s CFO, Karsten Knudsen, tried to calm the waters, saying the rebates were a one-time issue. But the shortfall was enough to knock Novo’s stock down by as much as 7.7% in Copenhagen, before it clawed back some of those losses. And it wasn’t just Wegovy that took a hit—Novo’s diabetes blockbuster, Ozempic, also missed expectations.

# Lilly’s Winning Streak

Meanwhile, over at Eli Lilly, the mood couldn’t be more different. The Indianapolis-based pharma giant reported a knockout quarter, with Zepbound raking in over $1 billion for the first time since its late 2023 launch. Alongside Mounjaro, Lilly’s other GLP-1 drug, the two brought in a combined $4.3 billion in revenue, smashing analyst forecasts and sending Lilly’s stock soaring by up to 14%.

Lilly’s secret sauce? A combination of beefed-up manufacturing and smart supply chain moves. The company has been investing billions in new production facilities, ensuring that its drugs are widely available—something that’s still tripping up Novo. Lilly’s Chief Scientific Officer, Daniel Skovronsky, noted that they’re not even pushing Zepbound hard, yet the demand is “unbelievable.”

# The Road Ahead

Despite the hiccups, Novo’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen remains optimistic, saying it’s still “early days” in capturing the massive US market. Novo is working to ramp up production and expand its coverage, but it’s clear that pricing pressures and supply chain challenges aren’t going away anytime soon. The company had to slightly dial back its full-year operating profit forecast to a 20%-28% increase, down from its earlier 22%-28% prediction.

On the flip side, Lilly’s got momentum on its side, having managed to get Zepbound off the FDA’s drug shortage list while Novo is still struggling with limited availability of one Wegovy dose in the US. Analysts predict that the US market will likely be split 50-50 between these two giants by year-end.

So, what’s the play here? Both Novo and Lilly remain strong contenders in the obesity drug arena, with analysts still giving them a buy rating. It’s clear that both companies are in it for the long haul, investing heavily in production capacity and new drug developments. For investors, there’s room for both to share the stage in your portfolio.



# Market Movements

* Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) posted a whopping $9.1 billion loss in Q2, largely due to the declining value of its linear TV networks. That’s a blockbuster bomb for the books, and investors weren't thrilled.
* Lyft’s ($LYFT) CEO is on a mission to KO surge pricing, unveiling a new feature that lets riders subscribe to lock in ride prices for specific routes at specific times. Whether this will drive their stock up remains to be seen, but it’s a bold move.
* Reddit is going full AI with new search features after teaming up with OpenAI and Google. The platform ended Q2 with shares up 60% since its March IPO and a 51% bump in daily users. Not bad for a social media veteran.
* Palantir ($PLTR) shares are on the rise, boosted by an AI partnership with Microsoft. It’s clear investors are buying into the AI hype.
* FTX got slapped with an order to pay $12.7 billion to customers, according to the U.S. CFTC. Let’s just say the digital currency market isn’t exactly rallying behind this news.
* JPMorgan ($JPM) has upped its 2024 recession odds to 35%. Sounds like they’re hedging their bets for a bumpy ride ahead.
* Paramount ($PARA) just posted its first-ever quarter of streaming profits but is planning a 15% layoff to keep things lean. Tough times call for tough decisions.
* Apple’s ($AAPL) rumored to be launching its smallest computer ever, a Mac mini with the new M4 chip. Tiny but mighty is the name of the game.
* Today’s jobs report brought some good news: unemployment insurance applications dropped to 233,000, beating expectations.

# Earnings Roundup

# Warner Bros. Discovery’s Stock Takes a Dive

Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) just hit another rough patch, watching its stock nosedive 9% after missing both earnings and revenue expectations. The entertainment giant is grappling with the fast-evolving TV landscape and took a massive $9.1 billion write-down on network assets—an ominous sign for the company’s future. Adding salt to the wound, their decades-long partnership with the NBA unraveled, leaving the company in a legal quagmire that’s only deepening its troubles.

# Under Armour Surprises, Despite Slumping Sales

Under Armour ($UA) defied expectations, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom lines despite declining sales. The athletic apparel brand saw its shares leap 17.75% after reporting $1.18 billion in revenue, edging past the $1.15 billion analysts predicted. The company is in the midst of a major overhaul, slashing discounts and trimming its workforce. While sales dipped 10% year over year, investors seem bullish on Under Armour’s comeback story.

# CVS Health Feels the Medicare Pinch

CVS Health ($CVS) is feeling under the weather, thanks to a rough quarter for its Medicare business. The pharmacy giant had to lower its full-year earnings outlook yet again after reporting a 17% drop in earnings per share from last year. Even with a revenue bump to $91.2 billion, high medical costs and challenges in attracting seniors to its Aetna Medicare Advantage plan weighed heavily on profits. Recent changes in how private insurers are paid didn’t help matters either, making it a tough quarter for CVS.

  


# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

There aren't any major economic announcements on the horizon for tomorrow, and after a whirlwind of earnings reports, things are finally winding down as we head into the weekend. With no big-name, large-cap companies set to report, let's shift our focus to some of the more obscure and quirky stocks releasing their earnings.

# Before Market Open:

* **Canopy Growth ($CGC)**: Like many cannabis companies, Canopy Growth’s fate hinges on the promise of legalization. Earlier this year, the stock surged when it looked like marijuana might be reclassified under a different drug schedule. But when reality set in that this change wasn’t imminent, the stock lost steam. While it might be an intriguing long-term play, keep in mind that until marijuana is legalized nationwide, your investment could go up in smoke. Expected earnings: -$0.35 per share, with $53.84 million in revenue.
* **Soho House ($SHCO)**: This exclusive, members-only club is all about catering to those willing to pay for a chic hangout spot. However, as a publicly traded company, it hasn’t exactly thrived. The company’s debt-laden balance sheet has investors so disillusioned that management is mulling over taking it private again. The brand may have clout, but the investment appeal is as diluted as their Picante de la Casa cocktail. Expected earnings: -$0.11 per share, with $302.97 million in revenue.

# After Market Close:

1en3g1b_LLY,LLY,"Eli Lilly blows past estimates, hikes guidance as Zepbound, Mounjaro sales soar ","Eli Lilly on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past expectations and hiked its full-year revenue outlook by $3 billion as sales of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound spike.

Shares of Eli Lilly jumped more than 9% in premarket trading Thursday.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $16.10 to $16.60, up from a previous guidance of $13.50 to $14 per share.

The company also expects revenue for the year to come in between $45.4 billion and $46.6 billion, an increase of $3 billion at both ends of the range.

The results come almost one week after the Food and Drug Administration said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Demand has far outstripped supply for those incretin drugs, which mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $3.92 adjusted vs. $2.60 expected

Revenue: $11.30 billion vs. $9.92 billion expected

The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.97 billion, or $3.28 a share, for the second quarter. That compares with a profit of $1.76 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. 

Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.92 per share for the second quarter of 2024.

The company posted second-quarter revenue of $11.30 billion, up 36% from the same period a year ago. 

Shares of Eli Lilly are up more than 30% this year after jumping almost 60% in 2023 due to the soaring demand for the company’s weight loss and diabetes drugs – and increased investor interest in their potential as treatments for other health conditions. That popularity comes despite their hefty monthly price tags, inconsistent insurance coverage and intermittent supply shortages. 

With a market cap of more than $730 billion, Eli Lilly is the largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S.

1cgq6h8_LLY,LLY,"Eli Lilly beats on profit, hikes guidance on strong sales of Zepbound, Mounjaro","Eli Lilly on Tuesday reported first-quarter adjusted profit that topped Wall Street’s expectations and hiked its full-year guidance on strong sales of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss treatment Zepbound.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $13.50 to $14.00 per share, up from a previous guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 per share. Eli Lilly also expects revenue for the year to come in between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion, an increase of $2 billion at either end of the range.

Analysts surveyed by LSEG expected full-year adjusted earnings of $12.50 per share and sales of $41.44 billion. 

The results and guidance raise reflect Zepbound’s first full quarter on the U.S. market after winning approval from regulators in early November. The drug reported $517.4 million in sales for the first quarter, even as most doses of the drug slipped into shortages in the U.S. that are expected to last through June.

Analysts say the weekly injection could post more than a billion dollars in sales in its first year on the market and potentially become the biggest drug of all time.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $2.58 adjusted vs. $2.46 expected

Revenue: $8.77 billion vs. $8.92 billion expected

Eli Lilly posted a net income of $2.24 billion, or $2.48 a share, for the first quarter. That compares with a profit of $1.34 billion, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. 

Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets, among other adjustments, the company posted a per-share profit of $2.58 for the first quarter of 2024.

The pharmaceutical giant booked first-quarter revenue of $8.77 billion, up 26% year over year.

In February, Eli Lilly said it expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, which will be consistent with the increased availability of incretin drug doses. Incretin drugs are treatments such as Mounjaro and Zepbound, which mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

Shares of Eli Lilly jumped almost 8% in premarket trading Tuesday. They’re up 26% this year after jumping almost 60% in 2023 due to the insatiable demand for the company’s weight loss and diabetes drugs. That’s despite their hefty price tags, spotty insurance coverage and intermittent supply shortages. 

With a market cap of about $700 billion, Eli Lilly is the largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S.

So the question is, is this drug difficult to make? Whats stopping everyone else from making their own Mounjaro/Ozempic ? If a company like Abbvie comes out with a new GLP-1 and it turns out to be more effect than the others, wouldn’t that crash the price of LLY?

1ajr0ey_LLY,LLY,Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Analysis,"Hello everyone, this week is another one filled with plenty of opportunities with many large companies reporting. To start off the week, I would like to provide an in-depth analysis into Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) earnings. Looking at the current stock movements and updating for the large overnight move that occurred after writing most of this there exists plenty of positive market sentiment and for good reason. To understand whether this stock has upside potential like many are saying, it’s important to investigate the financials and momentum of the stock before making an informed decision. 

With all that said, let dive into some key information:
 
Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) is an American pharmaceutical company specializing in a wide variety of medicines with the most attention recently being on the weight loss capability of certain offerings. In early Q4 the FDA approved the weight loss drug Zepbound which is built on many of the same foundations as Mounjaro (also LLY product) and Ozempic (offered by Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), these products prove to be 20%+ more effective at aiding in weight loss than anything previously available in the market. This new drug operates by activating both GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone receptors causing the patient to feel satiated. 
 
Financial Information and Competitors:
 
LTM Price increase: +$329.99 (97.73%)
Revenue increase: 37% YoY Q3 and 17% YTD 2023
Product mix: New products like Mounjaro are responsible for ~$2.0B in revenues in Q3 2023 and rapidly growing
Competitors: Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) 

Earnings:

Q3 Reported EPS: $0.10 (-87.31% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $9.50B (+5.96% delta)

Stock Move: Stock jumped 6.69% despite EPS miss over the course of 6 days (Nov 2-8)

Q4 Expected EPS: $2.36 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $8.97B

Verdict: 

With LLY reporting earnings before market open on February 6th, it is easy to see why there is so much optimism with this stock. With the large product offering provided by this company along with their new products quickly gaining momentum, there is a lot of potential for this stock. Historically LLY has an average movement of 3.7% after earnings meaning that if history is any bearing expect a move of ~$25 in either direction. 

Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. Now, going into this earnings play I can see the stock going past $715 very easily especially after the 5%+ move of NVO last week. I am loading up on $700 Calls with an expiration of Feb 9th due to the increased time we have this week unlike last earning that occurred on a Thursday. I would not be surprised to see the stock dip after earnings but see it bouncing right back over the coming days. This movement seems to be common with this stock, but again, with the longer week $735 after earnings is a very real possibility. 

We have many more earnings to play this week (F, PYPL, RBLX, MSTR, etc.), so expect to see more posts like this one. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!",2024-02-05,13,32

Looking for LLY to open in the 720s tomorrow. Hopefully 730. I'm a tad worried about the Inflation Reduction Act but I think ultimately investors will respond favorably to the fact that Eli Lilly's weight loss drug is more potent than Ozempic.

With the incredible 2023 performance of the Mag7 and Mega caps, it would be naive to think this same growth will be the case next year. The AI paradigm shift is being priced in all aspects required to build its infrastructure. Machinery in AMAT and ASML, chips rising rapidly (literally pick anyone in SMH) or major software companies including cybersecurity. This shift of a new world economy and society is just the beginning of further change.

The other major shift concurrently taking place on consumers and it could likely happen much quicker. $KO is going to be a strong growth stock for the next 3 years (I would argue potential of over 200% growth over this time).

Why, you ask? Fairlife protein shakes. It is being consistently reported by $LLY and $NVO in their research. There is clear and growing importance to pairing with Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. The consensus is that with a lack of craving for ""more"", nutrition is being obtained through these high protein and vitamin shakes with Fairlife. The difference here is the most crucial piece though- they are significantly better tasting and enjoyed for the value and nutrition (according to almost anyone/any forum/ LLY and NVO data). It could be predicted the average diabetic/weight loss patient is likely to be purchasing these for meal replacement. 

If you review  r/Costco posting in regards to this trend, you will find them constantly sold out. Individuals and employees state they are getting as many of the 18 cases as they can. Others have noted the price of such increasing from 27$ to 35$ per 18 pack in a 6-month span. 

If we just use the most recent data from Goldman Sachs projecting 5 Million patient users, who could expectedly drink one of these Fairlife shakes per day, (Note: Goldman expectation is JUST for Mounjaro), $KO Market cap can expect to grow 10.9% up to $286 Bln. However, this assumes a stagnant PE ratio at current \~23 level. If there is any further growth expectations from investors, or sustainable forward/current PE levels; $KO could be a top performer in the next 3 years, especially compared with Large Value peers. Additionally, if any form of insurance coverage supports these new drugs, there would likely be a neon swan event that could propel $KO near $800Bln-$1Trln market cap over the 3-5 years.

Update: it will cost you 61$ and 3 weeks to get an 18 pack of Fairlife

LLY launched Mounjaro in May 2022. They are doing a lot of research with obesity drugs, and weight loss drugs are the most researched category in their portfolio. Mounjaro is their weight loss drug and I am very bullish on their success. What Mounjaro does is make you eat less in order to lose weight and if you have an eating problem, Mounjaro makes you think about food less. I think it gives a Dopamine rush to the brain to prevent people from relying on the dopamine when they get full. It does make a massive difference. A friend of mine takes Mounjaro and she tells me it makes a massive difference. She states that Mounjaro takes away the ""food noise"" in her head, so she doesn't continually think about food. When you first take Mounjaro, you will have morning sickness for 2-3 days, but if you use it right before you go to sleep you will sleep through most of it. There are rumors about other health problems, but the only continuing side effect my friend mentioned is a little constipation. She states that MiraLAX takes that problem away fast.

Mounjaro is the 4th biggest revenue producer for LLY in Q1, the 2nd biggest in Q2 and 3rd biggest of all of 2023 revenue. Mounjaro is $100 million behind Verzenio revenue YTD, and behind Trulicity which is a little less than double Mounjaro's revenue YTD. I think Mounjaro will overtake Trulicity for first place in the amount of revenue because of the big increases in revenues Q/Q. Q2 revenue was $8.31 Billion. Mounjaro revenue was $979.7 million, which represents a 42% increase Q/Q. LLY increased 2023 revenue guidance in Q1 and in Q2 to $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion which is a 6% - 7% increase from the previous guidance. If Mounjaro revenue stays at the constant rate of $979.7 million per quarter for 4 quarters it will make up 11.4% of all of LLY revenue for the year according to the guidance revenue. Mounjaro has only started seeing this big increase in sales since the start of 2023, so I believe that Mounjaro still has a lot of room to grow.

From a balance sheet perspective, LLY has $54.814 billion in total assets and $18.158 Billion in long term debt.  They paid down the $1.4 billion in short term debt they had. They have $2.5 billion in their share repurchase program.  They have $2.694 billion in cash. Long term debt increased by $4 billion YTD. LLY also recently bought POINT biopharma for $1.4 Billion which will help other drug advancements as well and their obesity drug portfolio. Net income of the first 2 Quarters was $3.108 Billion.

Prices using Q2 Revenue

If you buy a box of Mounjaro it comes with four shots that you take weekly. The local hospital near me will charge you in 1 of 3 ways: full retail price, which is $940 a box or $12,200 a year. Alternatively, you can get the manufacturing discount which is $790 per box or $10,270 a year. The last pricing model depends on your insurance. It is difficult to determine the net price insurance companies pay. However, more insurance companies are starting to cover Mounjaro for obesity, which will make it more assessable and drive revenue. On slide 11 for the Q2 presentation it shows that there were about 1,500,000 paid prescriptions during Q2, which would mean each box is being sold for about $653. This makes sense to me because insurance companies can negotiate better discounts than $790 per box previously stated.

Earnings

I expect them to beat their next quarterly earnings forecast because of increased Mounjaro sales and a growing market for obesity drugs. Analysts say that the obesity drug market will be over $100 billion dollars by 2030. I think that only two companies have the opportunity to dominate that market, which are LLY and NVO. I don't have a price target but they have been on my radar for a few months now. I bought some shares recently at $595. Earnings are on November 2nd.

More than that, there seems to be anecdotal support for the idea of using Mounjaro to help treat addiction in a wide variety of patients.

 Twitter Inc. suspended the $8 subscription program it launched earlier this week to combat a growing problem of users impersonating major brands, a person familiar with the move said.

Existing subscribers will still have access to their account, said the person who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The move was reported earlier by the website Platformer.

Twitter is struggling with impostor accounts since the company allowed paying subscribers to get verified blue check marks. One account posing as Indianapolis-based pharma giant Eli Lilly & Co. tweeted that insulin was now free — forcing the company to issue an apology. “We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account,” the official account tweeted. Eli Lilly's stock then fell 4.9% on Friday.

The company has also reinstated “official” badges for high-profile accounts, with the gray badge reappearing below the profiles of businesses and major media outlets Friday based on an internal approved list, according to the person. The identification marker was rolled out earlier this week before being scrapped.

“To combat impersonation, we’ve added an ‘Official’ label to some accounts,” Twitter Support tweeted on Friday.

Elon Musk tweeted the same day that all accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name.

The world’s wealthiest man, who acquired Twitter last month for $44 billion, is facing a slew of challenges as top advertisers pull back from the platform amid concern over the company’s ability to tackle impostors and hate speech. Musk, who has also seen resignations among his leadership team, said this week in his first address to employees that the company could face bankruptcy, Bloomberg News previously reported.

xqc0y2_LLY,LLY,$LLY is gonna go through the roof today.,"**What's Going On With Eli Lilly Stock Shooting Higher Today**

7:25 am ET September 28, 2022

**Eli Lilly And Co** (NYSE: LLY) shares are trading higher by 7.60% to $334.75 during Wednesday's pre-market session after **Biogen Inc** (NASDAQ: BIIB) and **Eisai Co. Ltd.** announced late Tuesday positive results from a late-stage study of their Alzheimer’s treatment candidate.

Eli Lilly's donanemab, an investigational antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease, is in trial to treat early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

**What Happened?**

Biogen and Eisai announced Lecanemab treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared with placebo at 18 months by 27%, which represents a treatment difference in the score change of -0.45 (p=0.00005) in the analysis of Intent-to-treat (ITT) population.

The companies said starting as early as six months, across all time points, the treatment showed highly statistically significant changes in CDR-SB from baseline compared to placebo (all p-values are less than 0.01).

In addition, all key secondary endpoints were also met with highly statistically significant results compared with placebo (p<0.01).

""Today's announcement gives patients and their families hope that lecanemab, if approved, can potentially slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and provide a clinically meaningful impact on cognition and function,"" said **Michel Vounatsos**, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen.

4b1e19_LLY,LLY,Eli Lilly's (LLY) product pipeline and growth prospects make it a strong buy?,"First time poster, so please forgive any mistakes. Heard someone talking about Eli Lilly being low.

Bad news is their p/e is 30.55 vs 24.10 for Avg drug sector. Still it seems to me like a fair buy, and isan't that what we're all looking for here? What does /r/investing think?",2016-03-19,5,3
