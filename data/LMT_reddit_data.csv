1k1f0mz_LMT,LMT,Option plays for Lockheed Martin's earnings and beyond....,"If the oncoming Easter break isn‚Äôt enough to get you excited, today we have Lockheed Martin‚Äôs earning report coming out after market close today and as always there is an opportunity for investors to profit. Whether you are bullish or bearish, below are good options traders to make for each direction that have a good profitability percentage, while minimizing downside risk‚Ä¶this is the point of these posts. I will be able to show you the best option trades to do, but (FOR NOW) you‚Äôll have to make a directional call yourself. I am trying to guide you as best as possible, I am not here to make promises that cannot be kept.

  
First, on the bullish side, we are looking at a target of 540, with a September expiration

The trade itself is 515/530/545/560 Call Condor, shown below

[individual breakdown of each leg of the trade](https://preview.redd.it/p6jct2jjpeve1.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=f00310c3f1052e856550b221be0ae62ce7c57deb)

Historically, the cost of this trade is mostly in the middle, but slightly lower than average, shown below:

[this is a constant maturity chart of that trade](https://preview.redd.it/h3pdt520seve1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce85e813f793b1ab3cede1c2bd1ee4615d8451b1)

Historically, the price of the underlying LMT equity has varied, ranging from 400 to 614 over the past two years, shown by the chart below:

Finally, here‚Äôs the heatmap of the profitability of the trade, showing the returns and the likelihood the trade results in positive returns

On the flip side, a bearish investor may predict the price of the underlying will decrease. In this case, with a strike of 440, we have the following trade, also with a September expiration:

460/430/400 PutFly, shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/htge6990ueve1.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe954a5f653de34d87f15f168440c1d5127e6a63

¬†

This trade is relatively cheaper now that is has been for a majority of the past two years, shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/c85ucke2ueve1.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3331dff0581fd0a3d2d543da452c343aae62e91

The heatmap for the profitability for this trade is shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/43zcq7i4ueve1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=810c837c8313bb102dfb5e06636fa04cfb27628a

From this heatmap, one can see the large range where this trade is profitable, as well as where it will not be as it nears expiration.

¬†

In summary, I cannot say whether the value of the underlying will increase or decrease, as that is for each individual investor to decide for themselves. That being said, these two trades allow both a bullish and bearish investor a good opportunity to make strong profits while minimizing risk.

1jgk5r0_F,F,"Boeing wins $20B NGAD contract, beats Lockheed Martin for sixth-gen fighter jet","In a landmark decision for the United States Air Force, US President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that Boeing has been awarded a $20 billion contract to develop and produce the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter jet. This sixth-generation aircraft is set to replace Lockheed Martin‚Äôs F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter jet.‚Äã

The NGAD program is a cornerstone of the USAF‚Äôs strategy to maintain air superiority in the face of evolving global threats. The program is designed as a ‚Äúfamily of systems,‚Äù with the sixth-generation fighter jet as the central element. The crewed aircraft will be designed to operate seamlessly alongside unmanned drones, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), to execute various missions.

While specific design details remain classified, the aircraft is anticipated to feature stealth capabilities, advanced sensors, and next-generation propulsion systems. The engineering and manufacturing development contract, valued at over $20 billion, positions Boeing to receive additional orders potentially worth hundreds of billions over the program‚Äôs multi-decade lifespan.

This contract award represents a pivotal victory for Boeing, particularly benefiting its fighter jet production facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The company has faced challenges in both its commercial and defense sectors in recent years. In January 2025, when presenting its fourth-quarter 2024 results, Boeing disclosed an additional $1.7 billion in defense-related charges. The NGAD contract is expected to serve as a foundational component of Boeing‚Äôs defense business moving forward, especially as its F/A-18 production line approaches closure.

The selection of Boeing over Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of both fifth-generation fighters currently operated by the USAF, namely the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, marks a significant shift in the defense contracting landscape. The move is particularly notable in light of Lockheed‚Äôs exclusion earlier in March 2025 from the US Navy‚Äôs F/A-XX program, its next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter competition, which left Boeing and Northrop Grumman as the remaining contenders

Recent Earnings Highlights:

Q4 2024 Performance: Net sales were $18.6 billion, slightly down from $18.9 billion in Q4 2023. Net earnings stood at $527 million ($2.22 per share), impacted by $1.7 billion in losses from classified programs. ‚Äã

Stock Reaction: Following the earnings release, LMT's stock experienced a 9.2% decline, influenced by the dip in net sales and a conservative profit outlook for 2025. ‚Äã

Political and Industry Context:

Defense Budget Considerations: The current administration is evaluating defense budget adjustments, with discussions about potential cuts to reallocate funds toward border security and drone programs. While initial reports suggested significant reductions, officials have indicated a more modest $50 billion reallocation. ‚Äã

Competitive Landscape: Traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are facing increased competition from tech firms entering the defense sector. Companies such as Palantir and SpaceX are bringing innovative approaches, potentially reshaping the industry's dynamics. 

Financial Outlook: Given the recent earnings and potential budget reallocations, how do you foresee Lockheed Martin's financial performance evolving in the near term?‚Äã

Market Position: With tech companies making inroads into defense, what strategies should Lockheed Martin adopt to maintain its competitive edge?‚Äã

1ic3eka_F,F,"Lockheed Martin cautions on 2025 profit view, hindered by F-35 tech upgrade","Jan 28 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin forecast 2025 profit that missed Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, as the defense giant grapples with delayed rollouts of a tech upgrade on the F-35, underscoring a cautious tone for the year amid rising global tensions.

Shares of the company fell about 4% in premarket trading.

U.S. defense contractors are seeing a surge of weaponry demand as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East, but are straining to meet demand amid a slower recovery in pandemic-related supply issues.

The Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects profit per share between $27 to $27.30 in 2025, missing analysts' average estimate of $27.92 per share, according to LSEG data.

In the fourth quarter Lockheed posted net income of $527 million, or $2.22 per share, a 71% slide from a year ago, as it booked $1.29 billion in losses associated with classified programs at its aeronautics and missiles and fire control business units. The losses came on fixed price contracts where Lockheed agreed a price with the customer but Lockheed's costs went up, forcing Lockheed to perform the work at a loss.

Arms makers are likely to get a boost under Donald Trump's administration, which is expected to increase defense spending.

But the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency headed by billionaire Elon Musk, who has indicated that Pentagon spending and priorities will be a target of the efficiency initiative, has soured investor sentiment.

The billionaire has also criticized legacy defense programs like Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet while calling for mass production of cheaper AI-powered drones, missiles and uncrewed submarines.

The F-35 program, which has been navigating delays in rolling out a technology upgrade to give the jet better displays and processing power under the Technology Refresh 3 program, contributes about 30% of the company's revenue.

Its aeronautics business, which makes the jet, reported a 40% drop in operating profit in the fourth quarter.

Lockheed's total sales of $18.62 billion in the quarter were marginally lower than a year earlier.",2025-01-28,33,11

1fu94of_F,F,"Why ExxonMobil, Conoco Phillips, and Lockheed Martin Rallied on a Down Day for the Markets","Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Conoco Phillips (NYSE: COP), as well as defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), rallied on Tuesday, up 2.8%, 4.2%, and 3.5%, respectively, as of 1:17 p.m. ET, even as the broader indices were down between 1% and 2% at that time.

Fortunately for their shareholders, but unfortunately for other sectors and the world, these critical companies saw their stocks rally as oil prices spiked on news that Iran was launching an imminent attack on Israel.

On Tuesday, a senior White House official said Iran is preparing to launch an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel. Then at midday, the Israel Defense Forces reported Iran had in fact launched missiles toward Israel. The attack comes after Israel has struck against Iran's proxy army Hezbollah operating in southern Lebanon. In addition, Israel is preparing a limited military operation in southern Lebanon to clear the area of Hezbollah militants.

Given that Iran and other Middle East neighbors are major oil and gas producers, the prospect of a wider regional conflict has the potential to disrupt oil supplies to the rest of the world. This is why both ExxonMobil and Conoco Phillips rallied along with oil prices, which were up nearly 4.5% to $71.25 as of this writing.

Higher oil prices would obviously benefit the top and bottom lines of Exxon and Conoco. Conoco is a pure explorer, but doesn't have significant production in the Middle East region. And though Exxon is more diversified with midstream and downstream assets, it still makes the bulk of its earnings through oil and gas exploration, and therefore benefits when prices rise. Furthermore, Exxon derives most of its exploration from outside the Middle East.

And obviously, whenever geopolitical tensions ramp up, that usually bodes well for U.S. defense contractors' stocks, with Lockheed Martin being the second-largest U.S. defense contractors by market cap.

Lockheed has actually had a tremendous year, with the stock surging over the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and more sales of its F-35 fighter jets to more allied countries.

In addition to general geopolitical news, Exxon and Lockheed also received two positive company-specific bits of news today. Exxon received approval from the Nigerian government to sell its Nigeria offshore assets to Seplat for $1.28 billion. Of note, Nigeria has been somewhat of a difficult geography for oil and gas operators recently, due to theft and corruption. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin received a near $3.9 billion naval contract for its Trident missile systems today, in addition to some smaller aeronautics contracts.

Neither news item is tremendously impactful to either company, given the overall size of these industry giants; however, these items were still likely incremental positives.

While oil and gas stocks are out of fashion for many investors, given the focus on climate change and reducing emissions, they do offer a hedge against geopolitical events, such as the one we are seeing today. Remember, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, traditional energy stocks went on to be some of the best performers that year.

So while oil and gas and defense stocks may not be as exciting as high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) plays these days, they do offer benefits in a healthily diversified portfolio. Moreover, most traditional energy and defense stocks also pay decent dividends.

So, today should be a reminder to investors of the role these types of stocks can play, offering hedges against geopolitical disasters, all while paying you growing dividends in the meantime.

1eja9ta_OXY,OXY,Mideast instability going to enter the chat this week $LMT $RTX $MRO $OXY $HES,"TL;DR: Israel went too far assassinating a Hamas political chief in Iran in response to the rocket strike in the Golan Heights recently. Iran is going to have to do something fairly big in response in an attempt to keep Israel in check. Resulting instability, escalation, and Russian interest in causing regional chaos could send oil stocks up as shipping through the Straight of Hormuz could be complicated by Iran if there is broad escalation.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Longer version (may edit later to add more sources)

Things are escalating the Mid East. Israel responded to a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed a bunch of kids at a soccer game by assassinating 2 guys. The guy who launched the rockets in Beirut (alone prolly nbd) and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas political chief (bfd). Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital. Assassinating foreign leaders openly is a big deal. Doing it in rival nations capitals is a bigger deal. And what it means is that Iran is now in a position where they *have* to respond.

Israel needed to thread the needle with their response to Hezbollah to hit the off-ramp. Hardliners were not going to allow a response that was too mild with the awful nature of what happened in the Golan Heights. But international actors were desperately trying to prevent a response that went too far so as to avoid broader conflagration.

International diplomacy failed and Israel went too far. They assassinated the leader of an organization that didn't do the attack in the capital of a foreign rival.

The US is moving military assets to the ME now to protect Israel from a likely Iranian response. Although Iran's response to one of their Generals being killed in April didn't do much damage, they are in a realpolitik position of having to punish Israel for this, lest they grant carte blanche authority for Israel to start decapitating leadership of rival political groups throughout the region with impunity. This is an extraordinary action that Iran cannot afford to rubber stamp with inaction.

Iran and its allied proxies run the distinct risk of escalating conflict in the region by being *too soft* in their response.

The final kicker here and the elephant in the room is Russia, Iran's closest and most powerful ally. Russia has an extraordinary set of incentives for Trump to beat Harris in November, the most obvious being complicating US funding for Ukrainian defense (there's a whole lot more there but that's one of the most immediate benefits for Russia).

With Harris taking over for Biden's doomed effort, the political calculus has shifted for Putin. A broader regional war in the ME is bad for an incumbent presidency by itself. That causing already teetering markets to collapse further is also terrible for Harris. And on top of that, [gas prices ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Wohar/publication/24076097_Do_increases_in_petroleum_product_prices_put_the_incumbent_party_at_risk_in_US_presidential_elections/links/54f467fb0cf24eb8794e6abf/Do-increases-in-petroleum-product-prices-put-the-incumbent-party-at-risk-in-US-presidential-elections.pdf)have a lot of influence on election cycles.

Russia may believe that a middle east war will produce a Trump victory and that otherwise, those odds are growing longer by the day. With markets on the ropes, Russia may believe prompting an large Iranian response now could be a tipping point.

And if Iran believes that they cannot afford a weak response, their best means of reprisal would be having their proxies attack Israel so the Houti's in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and what's left of Hamas in Gaza.

How to play it:

HES, OXY, MRO - The Straight of Hormuz is the concern. If Iran wants, they can shut it down or at a minimum make passage very difficult. That means oil companies with less production in the ME have the most to gain. After 10/7 when there was a perceived risk that Iran would complicate the straight, all 3 of these jumped over the week following. Plus the options are pretty cheap. Depending on how this is developing Monday, I'll probably buy some MRO $28c 8/23 (currently about .55). I don't trade a lot of oil stocks so any feedback welcome on these companies. One other upside is that they all appear to be oversold currently.

EDIT: Its true that these three don't move very fast but the premiums reflect that. Needless to say, its certainly not a play you want to make very far OTM if at all, imo. Commentor [La\_Menace\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/La_Menace_/) also pointed out the risk that if the gains for these companies are modest, economic chaos may swallow any gains they make because of Hormuz stuff. For me, the premiums are cheap enough that it could be a reasonable lotto play but certainly to each their own on this.

EDIT: [CultureForsaken3762](https://www.reddit.com/user/CultureForsaken3762/) Says XOP is the play, more correlation with oil prices. Ty

LMT, RTX, defense etfs - appears as though these companies have been on a run but they could go further if things escalate. Again, any input on these/defense stocks that could run is welcome, don't typically trade them.

DRS too? Comment below reads:

""Solid DD but missing DRS when talking about defense stocks in this region shows you could‚Äôve gone deeper. It will fly in the near future"". Certainly worth a look ty!

ZIM - someone mentioned this the other day and it did go up at the Golan attack. However, look at its chart after 10/7 before you make the call on that, it actually went down (iirc) a few days after.

Index Puts - I mean who doesn't have these right now?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just gonna put a couple other notes about things down here but you don't need to read this part unless you hate yourself and your spare time.

1. De-escalation scenario - the window is narrower than post-golan imo. The reason is because doing very little to nothing effectual in response is now by itself a cause for escalation because it invites more assassinations and attack by Israel. Plus with Russia potentially wanting war, there is no voice in the room for Iran that is discouraging attacks. I'm having trouble seeing an Iranian response that delivers a pound of flesh
2. Nuclear things - I don't see a strong risk of a nuclear response any time in the near future but if tensions escalate and international actors get drawn-in, the more likely nuclear thing that could escalate things is declaration by either Iran or Israel. Iran cause they finished thier first bomb. Israel could abandon long-standing nuclear opacity as a flex.
3. The Tehran assassination - as details emerge, it could influence the response. If it was just a drone through a window, that's one thing. But if some of these reports that Iranian security helped plant the bomb and it was there for month are true, it means Iran needs to be a lot more worried because they are compromised af.
4. Already escalating - been checking in on the news as I write this. Israel is stepping up attacks on South Lebanon, they blew up a school today, they killed another vip in the West Bank today, Yemen may have just taken a shot at a ship from the UK.
5. Biden may have lost his ability to influence Bibi- it seemed to me like the assassination of the commanding officer that launched the Golan missiles was a smart off-ramp attack. I wouldn't be surprised if that killing was negotiated through backchannel (Hez might have even given him up thinking it would avoid an escalation). But it seems like Biden had no idea Israel was planning to pop the Hamas political chief in Tehran. If that's the case, it means Israel is giving in to hardliners internally and shutting-out the 'cooler heads'.  Even worse they may be faking willingness to agree to a truce to buy more time. Article about that:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations)

6. Hope I'm wrong about things escalating, there's enough dead kids in Gaza already, I'm by no means rooting for Israel to open-up on Lebanon. But I think given recent events, its worth keeping an eye on.

EDIT/UPDATE: This is looking quite bad. The Biden Admin has no control over what Netanyahu is doing now. They can't stop them and its become evident that Bibi has been bullshitting Biden about the cease fire in Gaza. Bibi fired Gallant, a bad sign when things are taking a turn for the crazy aggressive (e.g. assassinating foreign leaders). 

Reports are coming out that Iran could attack [within the next 48 hours](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken). No way to know if that's true. Could also just be Israel hyping the threat to make the case for preemption.

Israeli sources are reporting that Israel could [preemptively strike Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-could-preemptively-strike-iran-if-intelligence-shows-attack-is-imminent-report/) if they felt an attack was imminent. What's interesting and worrisome about those reports is that they seem more like Israel priming the narrative for why preemption was the only option. They're setting a low bar for ""knowing the attack is imminent"" as its pretty widely recognized that Iran plans to attack somehow.

Finally, the reason why escalation might be right around the corner is that most parties involved now want it and benefit from it. Putin because war, economic recession (at least correction), and sky-high gas prices are a good formula for getting Trump elected. Iran because their hardliners are losing their minds because of the assassination. And finally Netanyahu also has an inventive to go to war now because he too would want to influence the US election. He's proactively been making the Biden admin look like shit on this one and he knows that a massive war in the ME is going to devastate Harris' chances in November. He'd rather have trump in office so he knows he can continue with this wild-west style war mongering and the US won't stop him, not even a little. Harris, on the other hand, is faced with a catch-22 if war escalates: Condition or withdraw support for Israel in the conflict and suffer the wrath of AIPAC before the election. Or support the war and lose the youth/progressive vote because Harris is the veep who's signing-off on selling bombs to a country that will kill kids with them.

1eja9ta_LMT,LMT,Mideast instability going to enter the chat this week $LMT $RTX $MRO $OXY $HES,"TL;DR: Israel went too far assassinating a Hamas political chief in Iran in response to the rocket strike in the Golan Heights recently. Iran is going to have to do something fairly big in response in an attempt to keep Israel in check. Resulting instability, escalation, and Russian interest in causing regional chaos could send oil stocks up as shipping through the Straight of Hormuz could be complicated by Iran if there is broad escalation. Defense stocks could also pump. HES MRO and OXY look like more attractive plays rn given recent price action. And of course, if things escalate quickly, spy/qqq puts should continue to print. NFA

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Longer version (may edit later to add more sources)

Things are escalating the Mid East. Israel responded to a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed a bunch of kids at a soccer game by assassinating 2 guys. The guy who launched the rockets in Beirut (alone prolly nbd) and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas political chief (bfd). Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital. Assassinating foreign leaders openly is a big deal. Doing it in rival nations capitals is a bigger deal. And what it means is that Iran is now in a position where they *have* to respond.

Israel needed to thread the needle with their response to Hezbollah to hit the off-ramp. Hardliners were not going to allow a response that was too mild with the awful nature of what happened in the Golan Heights. But international actors were desperately trying to prevent a response that went too far so as to avoid broader conflagration.

International diplomacy failed and Israel went too far. They assassinated the leader of an organization that didn't do the attack in the capital of a foreign rival.

The US is moving military assets to the ME now to protect Israel from a likely Iranian response. Although Iran's response to one of their Generals being killed in April didn't do much damage, they are in a realpolitik position of having to punish Israel for this, lest they grant carte blanche authority for Israel to start decapitating leadership of rival political groups throughout the region with impunity. This is an extraordinary action that Iran cannot afford to rubber stamp with inaction.

Iran and its allied proxies run the distinct risk of escalating conflict in the region by being *too soft* in their response.

The final kicker here and the elephant in the room is Russia, Iran's closest and most powerful ally. Russia has an extraordinary set of incentives for Trump to beat Harris in November, the most obvious being complicating US funding for Ukrainian defense (there's a whole lot more there but that's one of the most immediate benefits for Russia).

With Harris taking over for Biden's doomed effort, the political calculus has shifted for Putin. A broader regional war in the ME is bad for an incumbent presidency by itself. That causing already teetering markets to collapse further is also terrible for Harris. And on top of that, [gas prices ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Wohar/publication/24076097_Do_increases_in_petroleum_product_prices_put_the_incumbent_party_at_risk_in_US_presidential_elections/links/54f467fb0cf24eb8794e6abf/Do-increases-in-petroleum-product-prices-put-the-incumbent-party-at-risk-in-US-presidential-elections.pdf)have a lot of influence on election cycles.

Russia may believe that a middle east war will produce a Trump victory and that otherwise, those odds are growing longer by the day. With markets on the ropes, Russia may believe prompting an large Iranian response now could be a tipping point.

And if Iran believes that they cannot afford a weak response, their best means of reprisal would be having their proxies attack Israel so the Houti's in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and what's left of Hamas in Gaza.

How to play it:

HES, OXY, MRO - The Straight of Hormuz is the concern. If Iran wants, they can shut it down or at a minimum make passage very difficult. That means oil companies with less production in the ME have the most to gain. After 10/7 when there was a perceived risk that Iran would complicate the straight, all 3 of these jumped over the week following. Plus the options are pretty cheap. Depending on how this is developing Monday, I'll probably buy some MRO $28c 8/23 (currently about .55). I don't trade a lot of oil stocks so any feedback welcome on these companies. One other upside is that they all appear to be oversold currently.

EDIT: Its true that these three don't move very fast but the premiums reflect that. Needless to say, its certainly not a play you want to make very far OTM if at all, imo. Commentor [La\_Menace\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/La_Menace_/) also pointed out the risk that if the gains for these companies are modest, economic chaos may swallow any gains they make because of Hormuz stuff. For me, the premiums are cheap enough that it could be a reasonable lotto play but certainly to each their own on this.

EDIT: [CultureForsaken3762](https://www.reddit.com/user/CultureForsaken3762/) Says XOP is the play, more correlation with oil prices. Ty

LMT, RTX, defense etfs - appears as though these companies have been on a run but they could go further if things escalate. Again, any input on these/defense stocks that could run is welcome, don't typically trade them.

DRS too? Comment below reads:

""Solid DD but missing DRS when talking about defense stocks in this region shows you could‚Äôve gone deeper. It will fly in the near future"". Certainly worth a look ty!

ZIM - someone mentioned this the other day and it did go up at the Golan attack. However, look at its chart after 10/7 before you make the call on that, it actually went down (iirc) a few days after.

Index Puts - I mean who doesn't have these right now?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just gonna put a couple other notes about things down here but you don't need to read this part unless you hate yourself and your spare time.

1. De-escalation scenario - the window is narrower than post-golan imo. The reason is because doing very little to nothing effectual in response is now by itself a cause for escalation because it invites more assassinations and attack by Israel. Plus with Russia potentially wanting war, there is no voice in the room for Iran that is discouraging attacks. I'm having trouble seeing an Iranian response that delivers a pound of flesh
2. Nuclear things - I don't see a strong risk of a nuclear response any time in the near future but if tensions escalate and international actors get drawn-in, the more likely nuclear thing that could escalate things is declaration by either Iran or Israel. Iran cause they finished thier first bomb. Israel could abandon long-standing nuclear opacity as a flex.
3. The Tehran assassination - as details emerge, it could influence the response. If it was just a drone through a window, that's one thing. But if some of these reports that Iranian security helped plant the bomb and it was there for month are true, it means Iran needs to be a lot more worried because they are compromised af.
4. Already escalating - been checking in on the news as I write this. Israel is stepping up attacks on South Lebanon, they blew up a school today, they killed another vip in the West Bank today, Yemen may have just taken a shot at a ship from the UK.
5. Biden may have lost his ability to influence Bibi- it seemed to me like the assassination of the commanding officer that launched the Golan missiles was a smart off-ramp attack. I wouldn't be surprised if that killing was negotiated through backchannel (Hez might have even given him up thinking it would avoid an escalation). But it seems like Biden had no idea Israel was planning to pop the Hamas political chief in Tehran. If that's the case, it means Israel is giving in to hardliners internally and shutting-out the 'cooler heads'.  Even worse they may be faking willingness to agree to a truce to buy more time. Article about that:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations)

6. Hope I'm wrong about things escalating, there's enough dead kids in Gaza already, I'm by no means rooting for Israel to open-up on Lebanon. But I think given recent events, its worth keeping an eye on.

EDIT/UPDATE: This is looking quite bad. The Biden Admin has no control over what Netanyahu is doing now. They can't stop them and its become evident that Bibi has been bullshitting Biden about the cease fire in Gaza. Bibi fired Gallant, a bad sign when things are taking a turn for the crazy aggressive (e.g. assassinating foreign leaders). 

Reports are coming out that Iran could attack [within the next 48 hours](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken). No way to know if that's true. Could also just be Israel hyping the threat to make the case for preemption.

Israeli sources are reporting that Israel could [preemptively strike Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-could-preemptively-strike-iran-if-intelligence-shows-attack-is-imminent-report/) if they felt an attack was imminent. What's interesting and worrisome about those reports is that they seem more like Israel priming the narrative for why preemption was the only option. They're setting a low bar for ""knowing the attack is imminent"" as its pretty widely recognized that Iran plans to attack somehow.

Finally, the reason why escalation might be right around the corner is that most parties involved now want it and benefit from it.

So everyone knows Lockheed Martin. They just received a contract from the U.S. Army last Friday for 765 Million Dollars for a Hypersonic Weapons System. 

KULR has received contracts from LMT before like March 26th for Heat Sink for Precision Missile Electronics. 

https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-enters-into-an-agreement-with-lockheed-martin-for-heat-sink-advancements-in-precision-missile-electronics/

Not to mention Lockheed among other huge names like NASA, DOT etc are on KULR‚Äôs webpage. 

KULR also has received contracts from the US Army for advanced battery prototypes.

 https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-approaches-final-milestone-in-upsized-u-s-army-contract-for-advanced-battery-prototypes/

I do expect LMT to work in tandem with KULR on this new Hypersonic Weapon. In LMT‚Äôs press release on it they mention this: 

‚ÄúUnder the new contract, Lockheed Martin will provide additional LRHW battery equipment, systems and software engineering support, and logistics solutions to the Army.‚Äù

Key word: Battery Equipment. 

KULR has a bright future ahead and coming off their Q1 results where it is as we expected. People were hoping to see number contracts which is poised for Q2. 

There has been so much news about partnerships etc that have not shown their true potential. Just go look at their webpage and you will see news and the big names they work with and press releases. Looking into the CEO‚Äôs background is also impressive and they have good leadership.

Lockheed Martin submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of Terran Orbital common stock for $1 per share in cash, according to a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Friday.

Terran said Monday that an independent board committee will review Lockheed's proposal.

The Rights Plan aims to prevent any person or group from gaining control of the company without paying an appropriate control premium or providing the board sufficient time to make informed decisions, Terran Orbital said, adding it will issue one right for each share to stockholders of record as of March 14.

The company said the Rights Plan will expire on the first anniversary of its adoption unless extended by stockholders.

Shares of Terran were up 6.6% in recent Monday trading, while Lockheed was 0.9% higher.

18inkcl_LMT,LMT,Why Lockheed Martin (LMT) Might Be a Smart Investment Right Now,"Hey r/investing,

With some recent developments in the defense sector, I think it‚Äôs worth taking a closer look at Lockheed Martin (LMT). Here‚Äôs why:

1. New Contracts: LMT just bagged a $175M contract for the F-35 Fighter Aircraft, showcasing its ongoing dominance in the aerospace sector. This is on top of a massive $443M contract for the Black Hawk helicopter. These contracts not only boost revenue but also reaffirm Lockheed‚Äôs position as a top defense contractor. If this all wasn‚Äôt enough, the House and Senate have just approved a $886.3 billion defense policy bill, and Lockheed Martin, being a leading defense contractor, often benefits from increased defense spending.

2. Stable Revenue Stream: Lockheed‚Äôs consistent government contracts, especially from the U.S. Department of Defense, provide a stable and predictable revenue stream. In an uncertain economic climate, this stability is gold.

3. Innovation Leader: LMT is at the forefront of defense technology. From advanced fighter jets to cutting-edge missile systems, their focus on R&D means they‚Äôre ahead of the curve.

4. Dividend Payouts: Lockheed‚Äôs history of paying dividends is attractive. They‚Äôve been known to increase their dividend payouts.

5. Global Security Demand: With rising global security challenges, the demand for defense equipment isn‚Äôt going down anytime soon. Lockheed, with its diverse range of defense products, is well-positioned to meet this demand.

6. Economic Resilience: Defense stocks like LMT tend to be more resilient to economic downturns. Defense spending often remains stable or even increases, regardless of the economic climate.

However, it‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows. There are risks, like dependency on government policies and global political dynamics. But overall, LMT‚Äôs recent contract wins and its strong position in the defense sector make it a stock worth considering.

What do you all think? Is LMT a good long-term play, or are there better options out there in the defense sector?

10kfq5x_LMT,LMT,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // JNJ LMT CVS,"**OVERALL:** A bit of a 'pause day,' at least by comparision to the moves we've seen lately.  All trading occurred (so far, 15 minutes to do) within yesterday's candle; therefore, there shouldn't be any major changes in terms of support or resistance levels.  Of note, it looks like neither the SPY nor the QQQ will officially break out of their bear channels...at least not today, unless either or both shoot up in the final minutes, I guess.  The SPY currently look the most 'at risk' of failing the breakout entire, by closing back down inside its bear channel.  QQQ looks slightly more comfortably above, bolstered by the gap-fill support level it is sitting on top of (having just filled it yesterday).

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout.

**IWM**: Another solid move up; however, note the significantly less volume today vs. Friday's candle.  Another up day on even lighter volume may suggest exhaustion. Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

rrfn72_LMT,LMT,Lockheed Martin (LMT),"INTRO- 

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace/defense company. It has four primary classes of products. These include Aeronautics, Missile & Fire Control, Space, & Rotary/Mission Systems. 

Another huge factor to keep in mind from the beginning is that roughly 70% of the company‚Äôs revenue is from the United States government. 

STRENGTH‚ÄôS- 

- 3.17% dividend, that has consistently grown at high rates over the last few decades. They have a payout ratio of 47.93% according to YF. I would like to see this be dropped, as they really have a chance to take huge amounts of market share in untapped markets.
- Lockheed has multiple NASA contracts. They are the prime contractor for the Orion Spacecraft, which will be designed for galaxy wide exploration. Additionally, many of their contracts are for aeroshells, which are used on most modern rovers and spacecraft.
- No mission to Mars has ever occurred without some sort of a Lockheed design. 
- No company has ever landed on Mars. Besides Lockheed, and they have done it four times.
- They are developing a new technology called MAIA (Model-Based Artificial Intelligence Assistant). It allows for predictive feedback based on the surrounding environment and other factors. This tech would be implemented into every military and space vehicle they design and build. This technology is the future of warfare, and nations will line up to purchase it.
- Current ROE is 82.89%. That may be an outlier, but that is impressive.
- Shares have decreased from .427B to .277B as of 6/30/2007-9/30/2021. Nearly cut in half. We all love some share buy backs.
- The military budget has almost never been cut in US history. Obama did make some cutbacks, however Lockheed still managed to grow their earnings that year. I hate to say it, but I don‚Äôt see tensions between the world‚Äôs powers declining anytime soon. When things get worse, and they will, Lockheed will profit massively. 
- I pray I am wrong on the last point, and if so, Lockheed will still have huge upside in all area‚Äôs of the soon to come, Space Industrial Revolution. Top that with buybacks, a juicy dividend, and a constant need for defense, and I believe this is quite a safe bet.

CONCLUSION-

These are only strengths, and weaknesses still must be accounted for. Additionally, more research must be made into their financials. However, I would like to hear the community‚Äôs thoughts on the simple bull case to be made. 

For centuries, only the wealthy would ever benefit from wars. Mankind has proven time and time again, we do not know peace. The wealthy ensure this happens. Why can‚Äôt we profit off it as well?",2021-12-29,74,55

rahamm_LMT,LMT,Lockheed Martin F-35 Deal to Finnish Air Force Leaked to Finnish Press (LMT) AND DR. Burry is also long on this one,"The Finnish Air Force is replacing it's 60+ Hornet fighter jets with a minimum of 64 new ones. Deliveries of the new Fighter jets will be taken between 2025 - 2030.

In the public tendering process the following manufacturers are offering their fighters:

Boeing (F/A 18 Super Hornet & Growler)

Lockheed Martin (F-35 Lightning II)

Dassault (Rafale)

Eurofighter (Typhoon)

Saab (JAS 39 Gripen E)

A Consortium of Aviation & Military specialists are handling the public tender process and according to media sources they are proposing the Lockheed Martin F-35 as the new pick. This would be the 3rd largest acquisition of F-35:s in Europe after the UK and Italy. The acquisition budget is around 11 Billion $ and the lifetime budget of the planes is estimated around 25-50 Billion $.

According to the sources, the Finnish government will make a decision regarding the acquisition within the following 10 days. The Expert's have recommended the government to buy the F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. Last time when the Hornet acquisition was made, the government chose according to the recommendation of the experts.

qgpede_LMT,LMT,Lockheed Martin is going to buy their own dip with a $6B warchest $LMT,"Lockheed Martin reported Q3 earnings on Tuesday and promptly cratered 11%.

**The Bad News**

* Supply chain issues are having large impacts on the already kinda shaky F-35 program
* Revenue declined 3% YoY and 2022 guidance dropped to $66B, below 2021's guidance 
* Management is reassessing their five-year business plan as a result of these issues

**The Good News**

* LMT increased its share buyback authorization by $5B to a total authorization of $6B

This buyback is massive - they could, at current share price, buyback 6.6% of total shares outstanding. Now who says they will use this full authority? Take it from the horse's mouth:

""With our stock trading at a level well below what we calculate as the Company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12, 18 months, if conditions warrant.""
-James Taiclet, CEO

Keep in mind, he said this *before* the 11% selloff - tomorrow morning they will wake up and buy the hell out of this dip as I bet they already did today as conditions sure as hell warrant now. 

What makes this all sweeter? LMT is a certified boomer company with the Institutional ownership to match at 74.92%. As a result, pulling 15-18M shares off the market over the next 12 months will have even more impact. A bonus? You get to pretend you're a boomer for a couple months and get a sweet 3% divi if you go with shares.

**The Spice**

In Dec. 2020 LMT announced they entered into an agreement to purchase rocket engine and missile part supplier Aerojet Rocketdyne. The merger has been pushed back to Q1 of 2022 as the FTC and DoD review the merger for anti-trust concerns. Elizabeth Warren is the most notable opposition (Who is *totally legitimately* concerned about anti-trust and not shilling for her home-state LMT competitor Raytheon - the defense industry gets everyone eventually), but 13 other congressmembers have lobbied for the merger to be approved. I bet it will go through (With some minor concessions) as a similar merger between Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman happened in 2018. 

If this merger goes through, that could be another good mid term catalyst.

But, I do have some concerns, for instance, future growth of the industry - For the fiscal year 2021, The US defense spending calls for $753 billion, In 2030, that number is projected to grow to $913 billion. This may sound like a lot, but it's actually only about a 2% increase per year.¬†

I often create bracket orders to buy when the price gets to my predetermined level.

Sometimes I notice:

* the second I transmit my order the price jumps immediately.
* If a stock price is going down and I lower my bracket Sell order closer to the current price it causes the price to drop drastically in that exact second.

I believe the Algos are seeing when a new buyer or seller enters in a new order and act in a way that makes you chase the stock for entry or exit.

**How can I overcome this issue?**

I see a lot of traders who trade like me (most notably ross from YT) don't use bracket orders at all and they just use the hotkeys to enter and exit and watch the tape for the price they looking for before hitting the hotkey.

My goal is to get enough LMT to buy myself a share on DRIP every quarter. (12/144 assumes 360$ LMT) 

My other goal is to get myself 100 shares of UWMC every quarter through Drip ( 1000/8000 assumes 8$ UWMC) 

I figure LMT is a stable company that basically owns all sectors of defense contracting with an enormous backlog bill, means revenue on stack for decades , and also‚Äùrecently‚Äù started building rockets via ‚Äúrocketdyne Aerojet ‚Äú acquisition plus the new SR-72 looks SWEET 

UWMC extremely strong mortgage (2nd in USA ) company seeking to start accepting Bitcoin (and other crypto) to satisfy mortgage payments. Sounds like a growth stock to rival with RKT and O ( I know o is not the same business ) just find UWMC to look undervalued with a beautiful dividend.

I look forward to hear what some dividend people have to say about LMT and UWMC.

Edit: I also own some growth stocks that I rebalance often to compound profits , have done well trading , plus I actually keep 75% of my Wealth in crypto as I‚Äôve been consistently making 100-400% , I intend to take my gains to dividends in a few years when I‚Äôm well into the 6 figures (maybe 7?) üòâ

lnnfhu_LMT,LMT,Lockheed Martin DD,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering the largest defense contractor in the United States; Lockheed Martin (LMT). They have great fundamentals and a solid, growing dividend.

**Business**

Lockheed Martin is a well-known federal defense contractor. Lockheed is responsible for some of the most storied and powerful fighter jets in the world such as the F-16, the C-130J Hercules, the F-35, and many more. They're also a very influential missile producer with offerings including the PAC-3 system, the THAAD System, the Javelin Missile, and the Hellfire Missile.

Lockheed gets 74% of its revenue comes from the US government, 25% of its revenue from international governments and 1% was from commercial and other customers.

Their operations can be broken up into 4 distinct segments: Aeronautics (40% of revenue), Rotary and Mission Systems (25% of revenue), Missiles & Fire Control (17% of revenue), and Space (18% of revenue). Let's take a closer look at these segments.

**Aeronautics**

This segment includes advanced military aircraft and unmanned drone production. This is probably Lockheed's most storied segment and is where a majority of people know them from. The F-35 program made up over 69% of the aeronautics segment's net sales in 2020 and is the crown jewel of Lockheed Martin's aerospace offerings. Production of the F-35 is expected to continue for a long time given the US government's inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft, commitments from 6 other international governments, and interest from other countries.

The drone part of this segment is very promising. Drone spending is expected to have a CAGR of 19.8% through 2023, and seeing as Lockheed is the largest drone producer in the US, they stand to benefit significantly.

In 2020, Lockheed Martin delivered 120 aircraft including 46 to international governments. This segment got 69% of its revenue from US government customers and 31% of its revenue from international governments.

**Missiles and Fire Control**

This segment provides air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, and ground precision strike weapons. Some of their famous offerings include the Patriot Advanced Capability system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. They also have some more cutting-edge (and expensive) offerings such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the Infrared Search and Track fire control system.

**Rotary and Mission Systems**

This segment provides commercial helicopters, surface ships, radar systems, cyber solutions, and simulation systems. This segment got 72% of its revenue from the US government, 25% came from international governments, and 3% came from commercial customers.

**Space**

This is the segment we know the least about as a lot of its operations are classified. The main customers of this segment are the US Air Force, the US Navy, and the National Guard. The US government accounted for 87% of revenues and the rest came from international customers.

This segment produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. One of the largest programs in this segment is the Trident II D5 Flett Ballistic Missle, the Space-Based Infrared System, and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. I can see massive tailwinds making this a very profitable segment.

**Revenues**

Lockheed brought in revenue of $65.398 Billion in 2020, a 9.34% gain YoY, a 30.88% gain from 3 years ago, and a 61.33% gain from 5 years. I think these numbers are absolutely staggering considering the performance of other Aerospace companies this year (Raytheon's revenue contracted 26.55% YoY and General Dynamic's revenue declined 3.62% YoY).

Switching over to COGS, we have COGS of $56.744 Billion in 2020, an 8.82% gain YoY, a 30.90% growth from 3 years ago, and a 57.49% growth from 5 years ago. While these increases may seem large, I'd argue that in the Aerospace industry, it's only natural that COGS growth will follow revenue growth. The only thing I'd want to see when it comes to this is revenue growth outpacing COGS growth which it has in Lockheed's case.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we see a 2020 total of $6.833 Billion, a 9.63% gain YoY and a 112.04% gain from 5 years ago (I left out 3-year growth because they had just spun-off a company meaning we get a growth rate of 248.46%).

**Margins**

Lockheed Martin currently has a net margin of 10.45%. Their net margin has expanded by 17.54% in the last 5 years. Comparing this margin to their peers, Raytheon is currently operating at a -5.55% net margin and General Dynamics is operating at an 8.35% margin.

**Cash On Hand/Debt**

Lockheed Martin currently has cash on hand of 3.16 Billion, representing an increase of over 108% YoY. The amount of cash they've stockpiled makes me think they may be gearing up for an acquisition, or (much more likely) continuing to pay done debt.

Speaking of debt, Lockheed Martin has been paying down debt significantly for the last 5 years. They've shrunken debt by 18.42% in the last 5 years and 13.64% in the last 3 years.

**Free Cash Flow**

Lockheed Martin has had a growing FCF for a while now. In the last 3 years, they've grown FCF by 21.09%, and grown it by 55.53% from 5 years ago.

**Dividends**

This is the part you've probably been waiting for (after all, this is the dividends subreddit).

One of the most surprising things I found about Lockheed is its dividends. Lockheed currently pays a 2.99% annual dividend ($2.60 quarterly) that they've grown for 18 consecutive years. In the last 5 years, they've grown the dividend by 59.34% and maintain a payout ratio of 40.75%.

For me, the fact that they pay such a hefty and sustainable quarterly dividend was just an affirmation that Lockheed has been undervalued by the market.

**Price Ratios/Other**

Lockheed has a TTM PE of 13.24x. This compares well with the current average industrials PE of 107.38x. Considering the growth rates we've observed in the last 3-5 years, I feel like this is a pretty low PE, although I recognize the short-comings and general unreliability of the PE ratio when it comes to valuation.

What I find really interesting about Lockheed is just how efficient they are at generating capital. They have an ROE of **149.38%!** This number is even more insane when you consider their peers' ROEs. Raytheon has an ROE of -5.53%, General Dynamics has an ROE of 23.00% and Northrop Grumman has an ROE of 32.03%.

**DCF**

Using Finbox's 5YR DCF template, I got a Fair Value of $400.35 (18.7% upside). This is using a 10% discount rate (the highest WACC I could possibly justify), a 3.9% revenue CAGR (also very conservative), and a 15.4% EBITDA margin (the average of the last 5 years).

As you can see, even with very conservative inputs, Lockheed has significant upside.

**Risks**

For any business, there are risks, here are some of the biggest ones for Lockheed:

1. Stagnating military spend - Seeing as Lockheed is a military contractor, they are dependent on military budgets. The United States makes up a large majority of their revenue, so they are sensitive to the budget put forth by the DoD.
2. F-35 troubles - The F-35 is Lockheed's current bread-winner, so if the DoD decides to back out, Lockheed could be in some trouble. I peg this risk pretty low, though. The F-35 program has come a long way and seems to be doing very well in test flights. [This is a good video if you're interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAepadiPBY&t=233s)
3. Aerojet acquisition challenge - Raytheon recently challenged Lockheed's acquisition of Aerojet citing supply concerns. While there may be a shred of merit to this claim, I think it's just Raytheon trying to get into a competitor's way and I think the case will ultimately be either thrown out or settled for tens of millions. 

**Conclusion**

I'm really bullish on Lockheed. I think they've been undervalued by the market just because they're a member of a sector with some laggards. That being said, I would love to hear some second opinions as I'm not as experienced as many of you are.",2021-02-19,309,82

First off, it has been bit beaten up, and is starting to recover. Many stocks have been hitting all time highs and from a value perspective I am bit cautions on those.

The major catalyst for LMT  is the major rumor that ARKX will have a sizable position in LMT. Well, her japan fund apparently already has LMT in it. A picture was posted on reddit few days ago. And ARK has been buying shares of it.

For those unaware, ARK, sort of the hottest fund right now with Cathie Wood will start a fund on space exploration and somebody like LMT might be her anchor position.

The stock will not rise a lot most likely in short term, but it seems like a safe long term play for this year, even if the market is in downturn.

TLDR: Buy $LMT, conservative upside of 10.5% + growing dividend.

**1.** **The Business (Revenue %)**

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: $LMT) are an American security and aerospace company/defence contractor who operate through 4 business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

**Aeronautics (40%)**

The largest area for LMT with 40% of revenue. In 2020, sales continued to increase with +10.9% increase in sales, +12.8% in profit and a healthy margin of 10.8% vs 10.6% in 2019. The highly successful F-35 program continued to shine with increased sales volumes. The delivery of aircraft to multiple international partners has allowed a degree of stability to revenues as LMT continues to ramp up production.

**MFC (17%)**

LMT produces precision aerospace and defence systems for over 50 allied country militaries with a number of contracts with the US military complex. The standout Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) continue to be popular products with increasing volumes sold and are the largest increases to operating profit in this sector vs 2019.

**RMS (25%)**

One of the more diverse portfolios within the business and comes with a very high employee count with 34,000 employees working under the banner. This sector includes radar systems, electronic warfare, logistic systems, and helicopter programs. The standout performer is the Sikorsky helicopter program which boosted volumes and operating profit throughout 2020 vs 2019.

**SPACE (18%)**

Highly classified and an increasingly popular sector for investors in general looking for growth opportunities. The launching of a Space exploration ETF by ARK, SpaceX rockets sending astronauts to the ISS and investor fervour in Virgin Galactic Holdings ($SPCE) have made space exploration in-demand. SPACE includes Space Launches, Commercial & Government satellites, and strategic missile lines of business. LMT are currently building a NASA Orion spaceship for the next flight to the moon by 2024, which will land the first woman on the moon.

**2. Financials**

The YoY growth in the numbers really speak for themselves, as well as the record order backlog that LMT had in September 2020 ($150Bn). I am not too concerned with the margin decline in the Space sector as volume/production continue to ramp up across the business.

(As of 29/01/2021)

Current Dividend: $2.60/quarter

Yield: 3.23%

Pay-out ratio: 44.4%

Chowder rule: 13.0

LMT have increased their dividend for a consecutive 18 years with a current 5 year average growth rate of 9.8%. This strong growth combined with a pay-out ratio <60% and an A- credit rating displays the strength of LMT and their ability to pay a dividend to shareholders.

**5.** **Weaknesses**

Now why shouldn‚Äôt you invest in LMT? Well, there are a number of reasons:

ESG

Let us face it, LMT develops weapons which will be used in conflict zones resulting in instability and death. You the investor are placing money into this system. Similar to Altria Group, some investors do not want to put their money into something they cannot morally agree to profit from (smoking).

US Government sensitivity

71% of 2019‚Äôs net sales came from the U.S. Government. Increased public scrutiny on the high US military spending combined with the 50/50 senate, could cause a slow creep away from profitable contracts. The Biden administration could also shy away from defence spending, coupled with further withdrawal from conflicts could cause a decline in revenues and margin.

TLDR: Buy $LMT, conservative upside of 10.5% + growing dividend.

**1.** **The Business (Revenue %)**

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: $LMT) are an American security and aerospace company/defence contractor who operate through 4 business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

**Aeronautics (40%)**

The largest area for LMT with 40% of revenue. In 2020, sales continued to increase with +10.9% increase in sales, +12.8% in profit and a healthy margin of 10.8% vs 10.6% in 2019. The highly successful F-35 program continued to shine with increased sales volumes. The delivery of aircraft to multiple international partners has allowed a degree of stability to revenues as LMT continues to ramp up production.

**MFC (17%)**

LMT produces precision aerospace and defence systems for over 50 allied country militaries with a number of contracts with the US military complex. The standout Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) continue to be popular products with increasing volumes sold and are the largest increases to operating profit in this sector vs 2019.

**RMS (25%)**

One of the more diverse portfolios within the business and comes with a very high employee count with 34,000 employees working under the banner. This sector includes radar systems, electronic warfare, logistic systems, and helicopter programs. The standout performer is the Sikorsky helicopter program which boosted volumes and operating profit throughout 2020 vs 2019.

**SPACE (18%)**

Highly classified and an increasingly popular sector for investors in general looking for growth opportunities. The launching of a Space exploration ETF by ARK, SpaceX rockets sending astronauts to the ISS and investor fervour in Virgin Galactic Holdings ($SPCE) have made space exploration in-demand. SPACE includes Space Launches, Commercial & Government satellites, and strategic missile lines of business. LMT are currently building a NASA Orion spaceship for the next flight to the moon by 2024, which will land the first woman on the moon.

**2. Financials**

The YoY growth in the numbers really speak for themselves, as well as the record order backlog that LMT had in September 2020 ($150Bn). I am not too concerned with the margin decline in the Space sector as volume/production continue to ramp up across the business.

la7g07_BA,BA,LMT: A Deep Dive,"Edit 1: More ARKQ buying today (~50k shares). Thank you everyone for the positive feedback and discussion! 

Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) or TL;DR for the non-military types:

LMT is a good target if you want to literally go to the moon, and my PT is $690.26 in two years (more than 2x from current levels). Justification and some possible trade ideas are listed below, just CTRL-F ‚ÄúTrade Ideas‚Äù. I hope you guys enjoy this work and would appreciate any discussion or feedback. I hope to catch you in the comments.

Team,

We interrupt today‚Äôs regularly scheduled short squeeze coverage to discuss a traditionally boring stock, LMT (Lockheed Martin), with significant upside potential. To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.

The source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME‚Äôs case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.

Second, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that ‚Äòthe little guy‚Äô is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major ‚Äòresearch firms‚Äô do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).

Third, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!

Now let us get into it:

**Leadership**

I generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x‚Äôd. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.

Jim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?

Rightfully, Taiclet‚Äôs focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the‚Ä¶ space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company‚Äôs P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.

It is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT‚Äôs positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.

In addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.

**SPACE**

Cathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the *new* space race.

In June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that ‚Äúit is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces"". Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF‚Äôs budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated \~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.

Among the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT‚Äôs contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC‚Äôs contract is set at $2.37B.

Tangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.

**LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)**

The DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military‚Äôs strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.

There are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT‚Äôs classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD‚Äôs LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.

**SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)**

The discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor‚Äôs existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS‚Ä¶ please be advised of that‚Ä¶ hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design‚Ä¶ just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.

The top 6 holdings of ITA are:

Boeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%

Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%

Lockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%

General Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%

Northrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%

As a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.

Backlogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an \* because they are still pending.

**Boeing Company** backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as ‚ÄòGlobal‚Äô): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA‚Äôs backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.

**Raytheon Technologies** backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter‚Äôs report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.

**Lockheed Martin** backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.

**General Dynamics Corporation** backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.

**Teledyne Technologies Incorporated** backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.

**Northrop Grumman Corporation** backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by \~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.

The winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT‚Äôs product portfolio and leadership a lot more.

**FREE CASH FLOW**

Despite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their \~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.

**HEADWINDS**

**New Administration** ‚Äì This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.

**Macroeconomic pressure** ‚Äì The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.

**Non-meme Status** ‚Äì The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).

**TAILWINDS**

**Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon** ‚Äì Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on‚Äîthe USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?

**International Tensions** ‚Äì SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.

**5G.Mil** ‚Äì We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.

**TRADE IDEAS**

**Price Target:** LMT is currently at a P/E of \~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT‚Äôs 5-year P/E ratio average is \~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of \~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT‚Äôs P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT‚Äôs P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT‚Äôs new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.

Share price today: $321.82

Share price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)

Share price with a P/E of 30: $690.26

**Buy and Hold:** Simple. Doesn‚Äôt take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).

**LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):** Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.

**LEAPS**: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market.

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data.

My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

#### 

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****.

For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares.

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

#### 

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

Other factors contributing to my model

Since a bunch of people liked the RTX breakdown [(link here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gfiin0/raytheon_technologies_corporation_rtx_breakdown/), I thought I'd make another post, this time on another defense company I've been considering, Lockheed Martin.

**Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)**

Lockheed Martin is both the US government's largest contractor as well as one of the world's largest defense conglomerates. The company behind the infamous Skunk Works program (responsible for aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk) and cutting edge fighters such as the F-22 and F-35, Lockheed might be the most impressive aerospace and defense company in the world.

The company operates through four business subsidiaries:

- Aeronautics - military aircraft (combat, air mobility, cargo), unmanned aircraft
- Missiles & Fire Control - air & missile defense systems, precision strike weapons, fire control systems, manned and unmanned ground vehicles
- Rotary & Mission Systems - helicopters, ship & submarine combat systems, land & sea missile defense systems, radar systems
- Space - satellites, strategic & defensive missile systems, space transportation systems

**LMT Revenue Stream Breakdown**

- Aeronautics - $23.7B net sales; $55.6B backlog
- Missiles & Fire Control (MFC) - $10.1B net sales; $25.8B backlog
- Rotary & Mission Systems (RMS) - $15.1B net sales; $34.3B backlog
- Space - $10.9B net sales; $28.3B backlog

[Data from 2019 Lockheed Martin Annual Report](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/annual-reports/lockheed_martin_annual_report_2019.pdf)

Collectively:

Lockheed's net sales for 2019 were $59.8B with 40% coming from Aerospace, 17% from MFC, 25% from RMS and 18% from Space. This was about a 10% increase from 2018 (59.8B vs 53.7B). All four segments saw increases in net sales.

Products accounted for 84% of their sales, services accounted for 16%.

Lockheed's backlog across all subsidiaries is an impressive $144B, lead by F-35 orders from the US government of 478 aircraft at a cost of $34B over the next 3 years. 

**Analysis**

The F-35 alone makes up about 25% of Lockheed's annual revenue. Besides US sales, foreign countries are also ordering the F-35, [with Norway having received 22 of a planned 52 planes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lockheed-f35/pentagon-announces-f-35-jet-prices-for-next-three-years-idUSKBN1X81I5). For reference, one aircraft costs about $80 million. As the most advanced multi-role fighter on the planet, orders will continue to come in, which will not only increase sales but also maintenance and service revenue for years to come. Additionally, operating profit margins on the aircraft are forecasted to increase slightly in conjunction with lower unit costs (which should increase sales).

Despite the current economic environment, Lockheed seems relatively insulated due to large government contracts and escalating global political tensions. One minor concern for the company is SpaceX threatening their contracts for space transportation and satellites. However, their primary income source, the F-35, is virtually unopposed. Some foreign countries may look to cheaper alternatives, but anyone wanting the best of the best will pay the F-35 premium. Outside of the F-35 they still have plenty of contracts for missile defense systems, precision ordinance, helicopters and combat systems. Barring any massive changes they should continue to play a massive role in the global aerospace and defense industry for decades to come.",2020-05-15,72,21

bokcub_LMT,LMT,KULR Technology Partners With Lockheed Martin to Provide Thermal Management Solutions,"&#x200B;

CAMPBELL, Calif., May 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG), (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúKULR‚Äù), today announced it will provide its space-developed thermal technology for a purpose-built phase change (PCM) heat sink to leading aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).

The PCM developed by KULR delivers concentrated heat capacity from phase change, utilizing the company‚Äôs proprietary carbon fiber core to provide tailored thermal conductivity and proven durability in a light-weight package.  The PCM device may serve as a structural element in the system and either absorb or release heat according to the application.  This fully passive device offers a cost-effective alternative to more complex cooling methodologies. 

Details on how Lockheed Martin will use the customized PCM heat sinks was not disclosed, nor were specific terms of the agreement. Company leaders did highlight the importance of their partnership in developing and using the best thermal management technologies for crucial aerospace, defense and other systems.

‚ÄúIn nearly every advanced technology, heat is a killer. And the more advanced, the more precise something has to be, the more important it is to isolate and redirect heat away from the source ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what we do,‚Äù said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR. ‚ÄúWe are very proud to be working with Lockheed Martin to design and deliver thermal management solutions to their demanding specifications ‚Äì solutions that allow Lockheed Martin to meet and exceed the needs of their customers,‚Äù he said.

KULR‚Äôs PCM solutions are expected to be delivered through 2019.

Lululemon fell a penny a share short of forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share, and its current-quarter guidance of 25 to 27 cents per share falls well short of the 39 cents consensus estimate. The company said its spring clothing isn't bold enough and promises to make more attractive gear and clothing to correct the problem.
