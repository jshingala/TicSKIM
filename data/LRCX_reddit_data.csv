I‚Äôve been a big believer in LRCX since my job as an industrial electrical apprentice has had me installing conduit runs in water manufacturing sites. Lams biggest and baddest tools are beside me day in and day out. When ASML dropped, I had a very strong sense that LRCX was unfairly punished by the market because of my anecdotal experience of witnessing what seems like a constant deject for their tools to be purchased and installed as quickly as possible, and the fact that they have a massive customer support presence in the industry. 

Further research was required. So I did what any sensible person would do and asked chat gpt about the differences between ASML and LRCX, but more specifically about whether the export restrictions that hurt ASML would hurt LRCX equally. The short answer: no. The etch and deposition technologies that LRCX champion are not as restricted as the advanced lithography tech that ASML sells. Finally, China makes up about 1/3rd of their customer base, as opposed to 1/2 in the case of ASML.

Furthermore, the company has sharp leadership, knows how to submit reports on time, has beat earnings now 5x in a row, and has a very high profit margin. Despite this, everyone on here was saying ‚Äúit always drops after earnings, even on a beat‚Äù. Which freaked me out until I learned that it was literally untrue. They rose on 4/6 of their last 6 earnings (now 5/7).

Today LRCX reported .86 EPS vs estimated .8, and raised guidance for the next quarter. The stock is up about 5.5% AH as I write this with a sitting price of $77 per share. 

I still believe the stock has a lot of room to run. It‚Äôs STILL down about 10% from where it was before the Dutch fucked us all. The only downside I actually see here is that the market seems to be generally down trending for a few days.

TLDR:
I bought a call at $75.00 strike price, it expires 11-29. The stock went up so I am happy, but you should buy it too so it goes higher so I get to be happier.

1g5c29r_LRCX,LRCX,Will LRCX Prove Doubters Wrong?,"Lam Research is an industry leader in the world of semiconductor manufacturing tools. As an industrial electrician, I work in a facility that I am not legally allowed to talk about here on Reddit. But I see their tools day in and day out. I don‚Äôt have any anecdotal experiences that would outweigh the considerations of an objective analyst, who knows the sales and the business on a macro level in greater detail. But it seems to me that there is a bullish comeback story here from what I see is a massive overreaction- and awesome buying opportunity. Here are my thoughts, please weigh in with any useful information or thoughts of your own:

The company has less reliance on Chinese customers than ASML, and export restrictions will do significantly less damage to their bottom line. 

The company is a leader in research and development in the field, keeping them competitive in the highest levels of semiconductor manufacturing, which is where the majority of the dollars in the industry go. 

The company has a very high profit margin (recently read it was around 48%).

The management is lean and hungry. 

They trade at a P/E of about 25, which is 8 dollars per share lower than the industry average, while also having a cash flow per share of 3, which is 2.75 higher than the industry average. 

I guess we will see how things shake out when they report earnings in a week. Personally, I‚Äôm bullish on the company. I‚Äôm opened a $75.00 call expiring 11-29 today, and lost 20% on it. I am expecting it to go back up, or at least consolidate. If nothing else, at least the volatility growth before earnings and the time before exp should keep the premium from getting completely fucked. What do you guys think?

**Lam Research Corporation** (ticker: LRCX) is scheduled to report Q3-2021 results on Apr 20 after market close. The company expects revenues of **$4.25 billion**, indicating a 10.4% YOY growth. The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.45, indicating a 0.1% fall from the prior-year.

&#x200B;

**Recent Price Action**

Prices of the entire semiconductor sector have been trending down during the last month amid rising concern around supply issues and murky macroeconomics outlook. As the earnings season kicks off, Lam Research price is showing signs of recovery. Short volume and put-call ratio have been declining in the recent weeks, both indicating a positive sentiment of the stock.

**Implied Volatility**

Going into the earnings, the IV has been expanding. The current IV rank (as of 4.19 after market close) is 44.11%. This means the implied volatility is roughly at the trailing 12mo average. And since IV percentile is also rather high, a volatility crush strategy seems reasonable.

**Implied vs Actual Post-Earning Move**

Lam Research spot price as of 11:40pm on Apr.20 is $484. The at-the-money straddle expired on Apr. 22 is priced at $24. This means that the market expectation of the post-earning price move is between $484 ¬± $24. This is known as the implied move. During the last 4 earnings, the actual moves tend to move around the lower end of the expected moves, but by-and-large closed within the market expectations.

**Proposed Trade**

My proposed trade is a Short Iron Condor strategy expired on Apr. 22.

**Enter on** Apr. 20 before market close, find out the latest stock price of LCRX, and the 04‚Äì22‚Äì22 at-the-money straddle cost to build the trade. 

For example, if the stock price then is 484 and straddle cost is 24, the Iron Condor can be built in the following way:

Strike prices for the short legs are based on the market expected moves:

Step 1: Sell $460 Put ($484-$24)

Step 2: Sell $510 Call ($484+ $24)

Strike prices for the long legs are based on the risk tolerance of the traders:

Step 3: Buy $455 Put ($460-$5)

Step 4: Buy $515 Call ($510 + $5)

Expiration date for all 4 contracts is **Apr. 22, 2022.** 

I choose $5 width spreads on both the call and put sides. The total credit (max profit)collected from this trade is $170, and the max loss $330 ($5\*100 -$170). The probability of profit of this trade is around 80%, which is considered as a high probability trade.

**Exit if** the trade is profited on Apr. 21, **close all 4 positions** before market close to reduce the risk exposure on Apr. 22.

**Caveats**\- It is **NOT** recommended to hold the strategy through expiration even if the price looks safe. Gamma risk can be dangerous.- Exit after 50% profit is also a popular take-profit strategy.

**Disclaimer**: this is just my personal insight which is not construed as investment advice.

**Please UPVOTE if you like this post!!! Thank you!!!**

**Now, a few words on the criteria I‚Äôm using and sources of data.**

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I‚Äôm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *‚Äì  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication ‚Äî  not a guarantee ‚Äî we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology:

*TheStreet  Ratings‚Äô stock model projects a stock‚Äôs total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we‚Äôre  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company‚Äôs  shares.

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We‚Äôre only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*‚ÄúA‚Äù Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Strong Buy****‚Äú.*

*‚ÄúB‚Äù rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered  the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Buy****‚Äú.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.

**6. Piotroski F-Score**

The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company‚Äôs financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.

**7. Moody‚Äôs Daily Credit Risk**

Moody‚Äôs  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company‚Äôs liabilities.

The value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.

**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:

*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*

*A  low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I  hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock  selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

nxq9s8_LRCX,LRCX,LRCX is the semiconductor play for 2021-2022,"**tl;dr:** LRCX will benefit tremendously from the US push to produce semiconductors. Buy shares and LEAPS. 

**Position:** 103x LRCX shares with DRIP (dividend reinvestment) and 1x 1/2023 $500c.

**The DD:** 

* The push within the US to produce semiconductors (microchips) inside American borders has encouraged companies like INTC, TSMC, and Samsung to commit to building multi-million dollar fab plants (semiconductor factories). 
* The semiconductor shortage in general indicates there is demand for more semis.
* The 5G and IoT rollouts means semiconductor demand will remain high and manufactories are likely to expand further.

LRCX is well-positioned to make money off this. LRCX builds the machines and does the research that these other companies need to make microchips. Without LRCX, there are no manufactories. And after the fab plants are built, the machines need maintenance. LRCX provides this maintenance at 30%+ margins.

**Fundamentals:**

LRCX has beat earnings 4/4 of the last quarters. It has the growth potential to continue beating earnings.

At a 27 P/E ratio, its valuation is average in its industry and has room to climb.

**Technicals:**

LRCX goes up and to the right. It has the fundamental backing to continue. Demand for shares increases as the stock gets down to $600.

&#x200B;

[RSI, MACD, Moving Averages](https://preview.redd.it/85xb9jk9bp471.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=e471b714290c3175f09ac20a21b391f4e2ea7b88)

MACD looks like shit, but RSI is positive and LRCX travels along its 50-DMA pretty well. Look to start DCAing into shares around this level and buy more shares or LEAPS as we approach $600.

**Competition:**

AMAT competes with LRCX in most industry segments. However LRCX stands out as the best wafer developer. If you cannot afford LRCX at $600, AMAT is $136. AMAT is also more diversified and is a good alternative choice.

There are some others including a Dutch company, but AMAT and LRCX are the main competitors in this industry, and they both have a wide moat.",2021-06-11,18,13

Is it safe investing in TSM?  Could US investors somehow lose their money if something went down?

I was also curious who buys products from companies such as Lam Research, Applied Materials, and maybe KLAC.

Does TSMC use products from any of those companies?

Why doesn't the US manufacture semiconductors is another curiosity I've had recently?

kco79a_KLAC,KLAC,Lam Research - A speculative analysis (LRCX),"# Introduction:

Welcome back everyone. I am back again for another speculation analysis. 

Sector: Technology (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials)

## Company Strengths & Risks:
Lam Research is a wafer fabrication supplier for the semiconductor industry. Now let me break down that sentence for the non-techie‚Äôs of the subreddit. Wafers are thin components for semiconductors. A semiconductor is a material that can mimic and flip between a conductor (let electricity pass) and an insulator (not allow electricity). They are made small and thin so as to minimize time between instructions. 

Strengths:
- Required for circuitry and technological advancements
- 5G on the rise- they will need wafers in mass production
- Very high growth ceiling
- WFH and corona was a boon to the business (mostly positive, precautions still in place)

Risks:
- Lots of competitors. Not certain if all are on the stock exchange but Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), Teradyne (TER), Entegris (ENTG), MKS Instruments (MKSI), and Brooks Automation (BRKS) are some decent ones to compare
-  This is a growth stock more than a dividend growth stock. They do grow the dividend but this is being evaluated more based on growth than dividend (to be ranted about later)
- Depth and complexity of chips will always increase. This is the flipside to growth. It has the balance sheet, and I am not worried. But as technology evolves, semiconductors need to evolve too. Like stronger NAND flash (usbs and SD cards) for a short example.
- China ban/embargo. Demand will remain but if the US is banned from exporting to China, it will need to be rerouted elsewhere. Immediate response is that they are in the application process as of Q3 earnings call, of getting the license to ship to China. As a positive, this shows their dedication to stick to their ethics and corporate compliance policies.


## Financial History and numbers

LRCX: 
Numbers from [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX/dividends/dividend-growth) and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRCX/balance-sheet?p=LRCX) as of Dec 12 2020


Stock                        |  LRCX
-----------------------------|-------- 
P/E Ratio                    | 27.9 (forward P/E 19.64)
Stock price                  | $491.70 
Current Annual Payout/Share | $5.20 
Yield                       | 1.06%
10 Yr Div Growth Rate       | -%
3 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 49.37%  
1 Yr Div Growth Rate        | 8.89% 
Years Of Growth             | -
Current Payout Ratio        | 23.24% 
Free Cash Flow / Share      |  14.05
Revenue                     | 3.3B
Debt / Equity Ratio         |  1.12

Lam Research has been paying a dividend since 2014 and has increased the dividend quite consistently. The payout ratio of 23% tells me that they have room to grow for a while. The downside is that the rate of increasing dividends is inconsistent but it does grow. But from a growth perspective, Lam is up 533% in 5 years, up 79% in 1 year. I don‚Äôt think this growth is anywhere close to done. I am uncertain as to why seeking alpha does not list years of growth but I will leave it empty due to that.

Potential payout based on 1 year growth rate (estimate. Actual mileage may vary)

2021 |  5.66

## Growth Potential Rant
One of my main realizations early on is that technology is ever evolving. In this day and age, it seems to be going exponentially rather than linearly. Circuitry is at the baseline of technology. 
Da Vinci Surgical Robot: A couple of months ago, you may have seen a video of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems robot allowing minimally invasive surgery. While this robot was not made by LRCX, it just shows the evolution of technology and how circuity is coming to other sectors. 
The rise of 5G: We‚Äôve heard it all over. 5G is coming. Guess what, semiconductors will be involved. I think this may be the safer play rather than speculating on the communication sector, or the first company to release 5G. Instead of betting on those, why not speculate on safe suppliers of 5G components? Well what happens after 5G becomes mainstream? I don't think this is even close to the pinnacle. Years ago, LTE and 4G were phenomenal. Now 5G is the new buzz. Technology evolves. What will come in the future to make 5G obsolete? I‚Äôm near certain semiconductors will be involved.
Other electronics: As technology evolves and semiconductors are further optimized, I expect other electronics to adapt too. Motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, tablets, remote controlled toys, and so much more all benefit from semiconductor optimization. Faster command execution, cheaper products, smaller products. There is just so much room.
We are approaching the point where technology can do things that may not be needed. [Robo Dog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot). Point in case, we are optimizing robotic pets.
I really don't see the upper bound of semiconductor use. Technology will keep evolving so semiconductors will evolve with them.

## Final Thoughts:

I don't want to oversell my conviction but I think this sub-industry may be one of the Teslas of dividends. This stock is barely talked about, unlike disruptive stocks like SQ. This company has room to sprint, keep paying dividends, it's practically all we want out of a growth stock but pays a growing dividend too. When the biggest downside is the many competitors, and yet they are still rocketing, I think they are positioned well for the future. 

I hope someone out there found this post interesting. Please supplement this with your own research.

Lam today announced it will provide funding and share its expertise in nanoscale technology and advanced systems engineering to support the goal of building a clinical DNA sequencer with the simplest workflow in the industry. The strategic collaboration with NanoString Technologies, Inc., a provider of life science tools for translational research and molecular diagnostic products, will help develop NanoString‚Äôs proprietary next-generation DNA sequencing platform.
 
&nbsp;

The objectives of the collaboration are to complete the development of the Hyb & Seq‚Ñ¢ (Hybridization and Sequencing)
single-molecule sequencing chemistry, design and engineer a clinical sequencing instrument, develop clinical assay panels, and secure the necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, the companies intend to explore methods for coupling the sequencing chemistry with advanced semiconductor fabrication processes to optimize the performance of molecular profiling platforms.
 
&nbsp;

‚ÄúWe are excited to collaborate with NanoString to advance the development of their novel Hyb & Seq system and chemistry to meet the challenge of increasing our understanding of human genetics, and we envision a number of strategic benefits by aligning our complementary respective strengths,‚Äù said Martin Anstice, president and CEO, in the public announcement. ‚ÄúThis is a compelling opportunity for the whole to be significantly greater than the sum of its parts; it is an accelerator of enablement and value for both companies.‚Äù
 
&nbsp;

DNA sequencing has begun revolutionizing medicine; however, its full potential can only be reached when the technology is simple enough for a small hospital or clinic to use. The Hyb & Seq platform is uniquely qualified to serve a small lab, delivering a simpler workflow and faster turnaround time with an improved cost of ownership. The proprietary NanoString chemistry is compatible with any clinical sample and enables access to a broad range of critical information for clinicians, paving the way for a new era in health care.
 
&nbsp;

Over the past two years, the Lam senior leadership team has considered where the company‚Äôs core competencies could be leveraged to create new opportunities capable of delivering long-term value to all stakeholders. The DNA sequencing market was selected as one of these opportunities because it is a substantive, high-growth market with the potential for long-term disruption. Lam‚Äôs core competencies ‚Äì such as nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma, fluidics, advanced systems engineering, and expertise in manufacturing and supply chain ‚Äì can add significant value in developing systems for this market. The NanoString collaboration is an opportunity to extend Lam‚Äôs technology leadership in a new direction.
 
&nbsp;

‚ÄúWe are excited to collaborate with Lam Research in a partnership that brings together leading innovators in our respective fields,‚Äù said Brad Gray, NanoString president and CEO. ‚ÄúBy combining our Hyb & Seq technology with Lam‚Äôs advanced engineering expertise, we intend to fully resource the development of the industry‚Äôs simplest clinical sequencer and enable open-ended innovation at the intersection of semiconductors and genomics.‚Äù",2017-08-09,1,0

3qpxqz_KLAC,KLAC,Lam Research (LRCX) Acquisition of KLA Tencor (KLAC) Concern,"It seems as though Lam has been one of the hot picks in the semiconductor industry since the announcement of its acquisition of KLA Tencor. With AMAT declining, the company is likely poised to challenge for the #1 spot in the semiconductor equipment and materials subset of semiconductors. As Lam and KLA service the same clients, but at different stages of the manufacturing process, the deal expands the breadth of Lam's product line while utilizing already-in-place customer relations and supply routes.

That being said, I'm incredibly concerned with their new debt levels after the deal goes through. While Lam's debt position was favorable before the acquisition (around $1.9B in debt with $4.33B in cash and shareholder equity value of $5.1B), KLAC raised $2.75B in debt for a special dividend a year ago, which puts their total debt around $3.2B. This lowered their shareholder equity value to a pitiful $421M, and their $2.27B in cash, while significant, is not favorable by comparison. Lam guaranteed all of the senior notes owned by KLAC, so this debt is transferable, correct? All of this would be manageable were it not for the financing of the acquisition. Lam is financing the move through $1.9B in cash (cancelling out all but $370M of cash gained from KLAC) and $3.9B in debt raised. Post-merger, Lam will have around $4.5B in cash, and a whopping $9B in debt. Assuming Lam only transfers assets and the aforementioned LT debt from KLA Tencor (not acquiring KLAs other liabilities), the combined company's shareholder equity value could be well under $1B. For a company with a market cap of 12B, $9B in debt with a shareholder equity value under $1B is concerning, although the $4.5B in cash is attractive. 

Can anyone shed any light on my thought process here? Am I missing something? Perhaps LRCX guaranteeing the senior notes of KLAC doesn't mean the entire debt schedule of KLA Tencor transfers? Or are analysts simply not worried about those debt levels? I've had trouble finding anyone with negative views.",2015-10-29,5,5
