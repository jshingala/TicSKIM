1kk2mm2_NET,NET,Why Aren't More People Talking About This Stock? - Lululemon (LULU),"This is an extended version of a comment I made on a post on this subreddit.

The stock I've been eyeing up for a while I just bought, Lululemon (LULU). This company is trading at what I believe to be a discount to its underlying value. This company has a superior competitive advantage, able to get away with high pricing and creating a near perfect brand image/reputation. How many companies could charge $105 for leggings, seriously? LULU also has far superior margins relative to the competition and lower operating expenses. Also, steadily increasing revenue. On top of that, a semi-steady increase in net income over time. LULU also plans to expand into the men's category and increase it's global reach and is already successful in doing so, highlighting the increase in global and men's category of sales in their last 10-K/annual report. Many people are worrying what the tariffs will do to this company. My idea is that the tariffs will make very strong companies even stronger due to their pricing power, and make weaker companies fall. Paired with a healthy balance sheet and good management, I believe Lululemon will survive and thrive. During the recent decline, I bought some shares. Let me know your thoughts!",2025-05-11,0,16

# Lululemon’s Comeback Stretch, Biggest Surge Since 2008

Lululemon just turned heads—not with yoga pants, but with its Q3 earnings. 

The stock leapt 16% on Friday, its biggest single-day surge since 2018. While it’s still down 22% for the year (compared to the S&P 500’s 28% gain), the strong quarter has investors hoping the brand’s mojo is back.

**A Stitch Above Expectations**  
  
The numbers don’t lie: Lululemon clocked $2.4 billion in revenue, a 9% year-over-year jump, and earnings per share of $2.87—well above Wall Street’s $2.69 expectations. 

And for an encore, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to as high as $10.49 billion. CEO Calvin McDonald credited the bounce-back to international growth and fresh product tweaks, like looser fits and seasonal colors.  
  
While U.S. sales dipped 2%, Lululemon found its footing abroad with international sales climbing 25%. China stole the spotlight, delivering a whopping 39% growth. 

The retailer’s strategic plan to hit $12.5 billion in annual revenue by 2026 seems less of a stretch now, thanks to its focus on men’s gear, global markets, and expanded e-commerce.

**The Takeaway:** Lululemon proved it can still flex in a crowded athleisure market, but challenges remain. U.S. consumers are feeling the pinch, and rivals are churning out leggings at lower prices. For now, the brand is balancing its domestic hurdles with international gains, showing it might just be the comeback kid Wall Street didn’t see coming.

# Chrysler: Once an Icon, Now Running on Empty

Once the pride of American automaking, Chrysler is now hanging on by a thread—and that thread is a minivan. 

The Pacifica, Chrysler’s sole remaining product, is watching its sales spiral downward, dropping 44% last quarter. Minivans might have been cool in 2000, but today, they’re about as relevant as Blockbuster.

**A Parent Problem**

Chrysler’s struggles are just one piece of the chaos at Stellantis, its parent company. Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram too, but it’s having a rough year. U.S. sales nosedived 20% last quarter, and its stock has tanked 40% year-to-date.

The company's average car price hovers near $55,000—making it a tough sell for price-sensitive buyers. Even after lowering prices, Stellantis has been bleeding market share and goodwill.

**Tariffs Could Break the Minivan**

Adding insult to injury, President-elect Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on Canadian imports could put the final nail in the Pacifica’s coffin. Built in Ontario, the minivan could become wildly expensive—or unprofitable to produce. 

Chrysler’s response? A reboot of the lower-cost Voyager minivan next year. It’s a bold move for a dying category, but it might just buy the brand some time.

Here’s the kicker: Chrysler’s dealerships also sell Jeep, Dodge, and Ram vehicles, making a shutdown relatively painless for Stellantis. Analysts expect the incoming Stellantis CEO to start with a full brand audit—and with only one fading minivan to its name, Chrysler’s place on the roster looks shaky.

**The Bottom Line:** Chrysler went from an industry titan to a brand with one lonely minivan struggling to stay afloat. With SUV-loving consumers, mounting tariffs, and Stellantis in turmoil, Chrysler’s survival will depend on a near-miraculous turnaround—or it could join Pontiac and Plymouth in the automotive graveyard.

Things are cooling down on the economic front, but there are still a few noteworthy reports to watch.

These inflation reports are the final clues the Fed will have before its two-day meeting starting December 17, where it’ll decide whether to deliver a parting rate cut for the year.

# Lululemon’s Comeback Stretch, Biggest Surge Since 2008

Lululemon just turned heads—not with yoga pants, but with its Q3 earnings. 

The stock leapt 16% on Friday, its biggest single-day surge since 2018. While it’s still down 22% for the year (compared to the S&P 500’s 28% gain), the strong quarter has investors hoping the brand’s mojo is back.

**A Stitch Above Expectations**  
  
The numbers don’t lie: Lululemon clocked $2.4 billion in revenue, a 9% year-over-year jump, and earnings per share of $2.87—well above Wall Street’s $2.69 expectations. 

And for an encore, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to as high as $10.49 billion. CEO Calvin McDonald credited the bounce-back to international growth and fresh product tweaks, like looser fits and seasonal colors.  
  
While U.S. sales dipped 2%, Lululemon found its footing abroad with international sales climbing 25%. China stole the spotlight, delivering a whopping 39% growth. 

The retailer’s strategic plan to hit $12.5 billion in annual revenue by 2026 seems less of a stretch now, thanks to its focus on men’s gear, global markets, and expanded e-commerce.

**The Takeaway:** Lululemon proved it can still flex in a crowded athleisure market, but challenges remain. U.S. consumers are feeling the pinch, and rivals are churning out leggings at lower prices. For now, the brand is balancing its domestic hurdles with international gains, showing it might just be the comeback kid Wall Street didn’t see coming.

# Chrysler: Once an Icon, Now Running on Empty

Once the pride of American automaking, Chrysler is now hanging on by a thread—and that thread is a minivan. 

The Pacifica, Chrysler’s sole remaining product, is watching its sales spiral downward, dropping 44% last quarter. Minivans might have been cool in 2000, but today, they’re about as relevant as Blockbuster.

**A Parent Problem**

Chrysler’s struggles are just one piece of the chaos at Stellantis, its parent company. Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram too, but it’s having a rough year. U.S. sales nosedived 20% last quarter, and its stock has tanked 40% year-to-date.

The company's average car price hovers near $55,000—making it a tough sell for price-sensitive buyers. Even after lowering prices, Stellantis has been bleeding market share and goodwill.

**Tariffs Could Break the Minivan**

Adding insult to injury, President-elect Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on Canadian imports could put the final nail in the Pacifica’s coffin. Built in Ontario, the minivan could become wildly expensive—or unprofitable to produce. 

Chrysler’s response? A reboot of the lower-cost Voyager minivan next year. It’s a bold move for a dying category, but it might just buy the brand some time.

Here’s the kicker: Chrysler’s dealerships also sell Jeep, Dodge, and Ram vehicles, making a shutdown relatively painless for Stellantis. Analysts expect the incoming Stellantis CEO to start with a full brand audit—and with only one fading minivan to its name, Chrysler’s place on the roster looks shaky.

**The Bottom Line:** Chrysler went from an industry titan to a brand with one lonely minivan struggling to stay afloat. With SUV-loving consumers, mounting tariffs, and Stellantis in turmoil, Chrysler’s survival will depend on a near-miraculous turnaround—or it could join Pontiac and Plymouth in the automotive graveyard.

1h84sq6_LULU,LULU,"Lululemon jumps more than 18%, beats Q3 earnings and raises Q4 guidance","LULU was up more than 18% in today's session, touching $409.16, a new high since March of this year. According to the latest earnings report, Lululemon's third-quarter revenue reached $2.4 billion, exceeding my expectation of $2.36 billion and above the company's previous forecast of a range of $2.34 billion to $2.37 billion. The revenue growth was significant compared to the $2.2 billion reported in the same period last year. In addition, earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.87, beating the market's estimate of $2.75 and up from $2.53 in the same period last year. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion, slightly below the market's estimate of $3.5 billion, and expects EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.64, below my estimate of $5.70

For investors holding Lululemon, it is recommended to maintain a holding attitude and continue to focus on its long-term growth potential. For new investors considering entry, they can wait for further stock price adjustment in the near term and consider a gradual layout if the price retraces to more attractive levels.

* **Debt:** Zero. Yep, you read that right. Lululemon has a clean balance sheet.
* **Free Cash Flow:** Last year, they generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow, which is pretty solid compared to their $1.6 billion net income. 



**Growth Rates Are Great**

* **10-Year Revenue Growth:** 19.7%

*Revenue* - growth is stagnating in the US because of the state of the consumer and the tightening of the economy. However, I expect now to be a good time to get in, as rates are beginning to get cut and the economy is expected to improve, increasing discretionary spending. The US is 80% of LULU sales. 

*Margins* - Lulu focuses on the premium athleisure market. This gives it higher margins than some of its competitors like Nike, Adidas. Moreover, its margins have improved over the years. 

*Valuation* - A company posting 8-9% growth at a time like this and trading at a PE of 21 seems like a bargain. Not to mention its sales in China are growing 15% or so (can’t recall exactly) 

*Insider buying* - insiders are buying the company stock. Recently, their CEO bought $1mm worth of stock. 

However, there seems to be intense competition from Alo and Vuori. I’m not even from the US but I’m seeing these names, especially Alo, pop up a lot more nowadays. Furthermore, some execution issues.

key takeaways:

* **Sales Decline**: Nike's revenue is reported to be declining, with a projected drop of around 10% year-over-year for the first quarter. This isn't just a one-time hiccup; their fiscal 2025 is looking rough too, with expected mid-single-digit declines. ([Rev and EPS projections](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/NKE/analyst))
* **Market Position**: It was noted that smaller competitors, like Lululemon, are nibbling at Nike's market share. The fashion industry is unpredictable, and you never know which brands will start gaining traction.
* **Valuation Concerns**: With a price-to-free cash flow at 18.4 Does this imply future growth?

1f971v9_LULU,LULU,Thoughts on LULU? ,"I’ve been watching LULU for awhile and curious what others think. Here’s my analysis.

MOAT:
Massive. No other company has the brand recognition. They are able to charge a hefty premium for their clothing for a reason. They’re currently the official provider of kit to Canadian Olympic/Paralympic teams and the athletes seem to love the gear too. They also control both production and sale of their products, allowing them to set prices and control supply. As a long-time customer, I know that the quality is high and the customer service is excellent. 

FINANCIALS:
- Virtually no debt 
- Average 43% ROIC for the past 10 years is fantastic
- Consistent sales, EPS, Equity, and Cash flow growth
- Their inventory shows that they are becoming less efficient, which is something to watch, but also something management is aware of and (at least theoretically) working on

VALUATION:
At a PE of 19.76, it’s selling for the lowest it has in years. It’s slightly higher than I’d like to pay (I aim for around 15) but realistically, I think it’s a good buy. 

I don’t currently own it, but I keep going back and forth wondering if I should wait for it to drop further. Would love to hear another opinion, especially if there’s something I missed. ",2024-09-04,39,66

The Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose just enough to keep everyone optimistic but not worried.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.

# Next Week

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",2024-08-31,5,1

* The stock market ended a turbulent August on a high, with investors cheering as fresh inflation data boosted hopes for a September rate cut. The Dow Jones ticked up 0.55%, hitting yet another record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.01% and 1.13%, respectively. The Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose just enough to keep everyone optimistic but not worried.
* While August was anything but calm—starting with growth fears and a mini-selloff—investors came around to the idea that the economy might be landing softly after all. The Dow and S&P 500 chalked up another month of gains, but the Nasdaq couldn’t quite shake off a rough patch for tech stocks. In the end, it’s a mixed bag, but one that leans bullish as we head into September.

* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.

1f4de3u_LULU,LULU,"Lululemon cuts guidance, misses sales estimates after botched product launch","[Lululemon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LULU/) lowered its guidance and posted its first revenue miss in more than two years on Thursday after it botched a highly anticipated product launch and growth slowed in the Americas. 

The company now expects full-year net revenue to be between $10.38 and $10.48 billion, down from a previous range of between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Lululemon anticipates earnings per share will be in a range of $13.95 to $14.15, down from previous guidance of $14.27 to $14.47.

Here’s how company did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

* **Earnings per share:** $3.15 vs. $2.93 expected
* **Revenue:** $2.37 billion vs. $2.41 billion expected

Shares rose more than 2% in extended trading after initially falling.

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended July 28 was $393 million, or $3.15 per share, compared with $342 million, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $2.37 billion, up about 7% from $2.21 billion a year earlier. Beyond total sales, Lululemon also missed expectations on comparable sales, which grew 2%, well behind estimates of 5.9%, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales in the Americas fell 3%.

The trend doesn’t appear poised to improve in the current quarter. Lululemon said it expects sales to grow 6% to 7%, worse than the 9.2% growth that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

However, Lululemon’s profit guidance is roughly in line with what Wall Street anticipated. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be between $2.68 and $2.73, compared to estimates of $2.70, according to LSEG.

During the quarter, Lululemon pulled its Breezethrough leggings, launched in early July, after it received a wave of complaints about the product’s unflattering fit. The botched launch came after the company struggled with a number of other self-inflicted issues with its assortment, including not having the right colors and sizes that its core customers desired.

The flops have contributed to a slowdown in the company’s largest market, the Americas. During the quarter, sales grew only 1% in the region**.** Sales jumped 29% in Lululemon’s international markets as the company looks to China for growth.

“In the U.S., our teams continue to optimize our product assortment and remain focused on driving forward our opportunities in the market,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a news release. “Looking ahead, we feel confident in the long runway in front of us.”

Like other retailers that are seeing demand slow, Lululemon appears focused on what’s within its control: operations and efficiency. While the sales picture during the quarter was rougher than expected, Lululemon’s profits came in higher than anticipated.

Gross profit grew 9% to $1.4 billion, while its gross margin grew 0.8 percentage points to 59.6% — better than the 57.7% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Its operating margin and operating income also increased.",2024-08-29,76,32

1eyu0fn_LULU,LULU,Lululemon: Value trap or compelling opportunity? ,"From a pure numbers perspective, the company looks undervalued. Their margins haven't shrunk at all this year so far and their customers still seem as dedicated to the product as ever. The only reason I can think of that has caused a drawdown in stock price would be an industry-wide slowdown in retailing as a whole. But since LuluLemon has not encountered many difficulties besides revenue growth slowing to around 10% from 20%+ I wonder what other reasons there are for the company selling at this price. Return on invested capital metrics also look very strong (Albeit my valuation model uses numbers that are about 3/4 of a year out of date). I also think that because of how strong the Lululemon brand is and how dedicated customers are to the product, the company should be somewhat resilient to changes in fashion trends and fluctuations in the economy. As long as margins don't suffer, I can live with slower revenue growth over the next year or two. Perhaps Lululemon also has advantages in that its first-mover advantage in the Luon fabric supply chain has enabled it to be a lower-cost producer of Luon-based leggings and clothes, and since the main product(s) of Lululemon doesn't change much at all inventories should remain controlled. In particular they source 40% of their fabric from Taiwan, 26% from Mainland China, and 12% from Sri Lanka. A lack of long-term contracts with suppliers should also ensure flexibility in the supply chain as demand rises and falls.

* I like the brand (Also, perceived circle of competence)

However, it isn't in value territory yet, and here is why.

**Growth**

(Source: Google Trends, Lululemon vs AloYoga in US) \[1\]

* In 2022/23, Aloyoga search volume was 15% of Lulu
* In 2024, Aloyoga search volume was 22% of Lulu

Also. for LULU

* Search volume of 2023 vs 2024 has increased by low single digit %
* This checks out because their revenue growth in US has only been 2-3% last quarter

*Takeaway*

* AvoYoga is absolutely slaughtering Lulu
* Dropping interest rate may help with growth, but not with market share

**Product Mix**

* Lulu has loyalists, way more than Avo (Lulu is the market leader)
* To be very honest, much of the recent innovation seems to be around color (easy to replicate)
* Doesn’t seem like they have a moat

**DCF**

Assumptions

* 5Y - Growth: First year: 10%, second to fifth year: 8%
* Terminal Growth: 2%
* Discount rate: 8%

With these generous assumptions, I get a fair value of 263, which is only 2% higher than the previous close. Also, I am concerned that there is no clear moat, so I am looking for a much deeper margin of safety, like 30-40%. Thoughts?

1elwqeu_LULU,LULU,BUY LULU at 50% discount,"Lululemon, founded in 1998 in Canada as a women's yoga pants retailer has since expanded to offer apparel, activewear, and footwear for both men and women. The company has also entered new markets in the USA, Asia, and Europe. Lululemon is a solid business with its stock price down 51% from its high of $516 to $253, offering a discount for investors looking to own a piece of this solid business.

**First three fundamental question I try to answer to identify a good business is:**

# 1. Is the company consistently profitable at decent and stable profit margins, through good times and bad?

# 2. Is this an asset light business that has a high return on investment capital?

# 3. Is the company continuously growing its revenue and earnings?

# Lululemon Ticks All the Checkmarks:

* **Revenue Growth:** Lululemon has grown its revenue at a CAGR of 19.7% over the last 10 years, including a 21% increase in 2020, with an operating margin of 19.3%.
* **High Returns on Capital:** As an asset-light business, Lululemon generates high returns on capital with an average ROC (Joel Greenblatt) of 52.5% and an ROIC of 26.66% over the last 10 years.
* **Consistent Profitability:** Since its IPO in 2008, Lululemon has demonstrated consistent topline sales growth and profitability, with average YOY growth of 31% in operating profit and 34% in net profit. The company’s operating margin has been expanding over the last 5 years, and it holds a net cash position of $1.9 billion.

In the calculation of net cash of $1.9B I did not subtract long term lease liability of $1.1B as it is an operating lease.

**Market Diversification:**

* **US Market:** While growth in the US has slowed compared to historical rates, the company is diversifying its revenue sources.
* **China and Global Expansion:** Despite economic challenges, Lululemon achieved 67% growth in China last year. The impressive growth in China and other international markets highlights the potential benefits of diversification as the US percentage of net sales decreases relatively.

Currently, trading at a forward P/E of 17.5. Overall Macro conditions and short term problems has led to an overall p/e tightening for the apparel industry. I believe a midteen topline growth for LULU deserves a multiple expansion. Nike has a forward p/e of 23 despite being a relatively slow grower and lower margins.

With a 25x p/e multiple x TTM 12.46 EPS (diluted) gives us a target price of $311.5 per share.

# Catalyst

Lululemon has $1.76 billion remaining from its $2 billion stock buyback program, supported by $1.9 billion in cash, indicating potential for further buybacks. The growth in international markets is a key catalyst as Lululemon's brand awareness is still relatively low compared to major competitors, offering significant upside potential with potential margin expansion.

1e8cm50_PATH,PATH,Why I am Buying Calls on Lululemon (LULU),"Hello Everyone,

This is my second DD, trying to go 2/2. First one was on Global Payments (GPN). Continuing with the oversold strategy. And this time, I will be going for LULU. Here are my notes from my research and why I think the pros outweigh the cons. Please let me know if there are factors I have missed or am overlooking.

  
LULU Price as of 7/20 - $280.24

My Position - 1/17/25 - $400 Call @ $5.50, wish I bought the 3/21/2025 $400 Call @ $6.75. But it is what it is.
Update - After all the constructive criticism let’s call it. I sold the 1/17/25 call @5.00 and will wait to buy at the 250ish area

- Board Approved $1 billion in buybacks on June 6 showing confidence from within the company.

- Beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, however issued weak guidance for Q2. 

- Stock is down 45% from all time highs, despite showing consistent growth in revenue and profits. Leading me to believe weak guidance is factored in. Also nearing/at key support levels.

- 5 Year RSI is below 30 indicating oversold. Which it has respected for the most part so far.

- Barely scratched the surface in the men's department, which has been a major boost for sales and expected to continue on this path.

- Almost all reviews of the product show positive feedback on the quality (from men/women), and margins have continued to grow consistently.

- Making about $10 billion in revenue per year with a market cap of only $34 billion.

- P/E ratio at all time lows, despite company being in a better position than ever before. Can be arguable but without a doubt not at its worst point.

- Total Debt of only $1.4 billion which is relatively low.

- Demand is still strong and profits are expected to grow faster than revenue.

- Continuing to open new stores in new markets adding to growth potential.

- 3% net revenue gain in Americas, but 35% internationally and expect this to continue to rise.

- Despite weaker guidance for Q2, the company is still projecting 10-11% growth for the year.  

- Almost every analyst/companies fair value estimate is $329 and above.

- International business (only accounts for 21% of business) is underpenetrated and shows long runway for growth.

- Operating Margins are unmatched by competitors such as Nike and On Holdings.

- Fears about competitors catching up.

- China/US relations and the uncertainty between the two could be bad for business.

- Revenue growth rate is going down however this is typical as revenue grows the growth rate usually goes down. Apple would be a prime example.

- Chief Product Officer left and announced overhauling its product and brand teams.  

- Concerns about the company having a low moat.

- Softness in the U.S. market and planned increased spending to grow brand awareness have resulted in a weaker outlook. Don't see increased spending to grow brand awareness as a negative especially during an Olympics year.

1dyc56l_LULU,LULU,Is Lululemon (LULU) really a value stock?,"Both here and on a well-known and educational [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1EPymWPsU0) for value investing, the LULU stock has recently been proposed as a value investment, because it has dropped significantly in price, and is comparatively cheaper than other related stocks such as NKE.

But a quick glance on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LULU/?p=lulu) shows the TTM Net Income was around USD 1.5b with a market-cap near USD 38b. If those earnings were to continue in the future, then the earnings yield would be around 3.9%, which is less than the yield on 10-year US government bonds that is around 4.5%. So LULU's future earnings would have to grow just to match the yield on US government bonds.

The TTM Net Profit Margin is around 16%, compared to a historical average around 14% for the years between 2008-2023. If we multiply this average with the TTM sales of USD 9.8b then we get earnings of USD 1.37b and an earnings yield of only 3.6%.

The full range of historical Net Profit Margins is between 8-20%, and multiplying all these historical values with the TTM sales gives a whole distribution for the earnings, that we can use in simulation of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

I wanted to post the plots of these simulations, but Reddit apparently doesn't allow posting images with the text (what year is this?!), so you will have to look at the plots [here](https://simsim.run/sim/report?sim_id=66853efca21ab583d51f9a0a).

If we assume these earnings continue forever and the growth will merely match the future inflation, then the plot with the IRR distribution is shown in the ""Sim"" tab, and ranges between 2% to 5.5% with an average around 3.8%.

The plot in the ""Sim Vary"" tab shows what happens when varying the current share-price. If we want most of the simulated stock returns to be above the US treasury yield of 4.5%, then the LULU stock-price should be well below USD 200, which is a 30% drop from its current price around USD 300. And it would have to be even cheaper if you also want a risk-premium.

So if the stock return is to exceed or even just match the yield on US government bonds, then the company's future earnings need to grow, or the stock must be revalued upwards - both of which would be considered speculative according to Ben Graham's classic principle of having a Margin of Safety.

While it is possible that the company will grow to the moon and beyond, the company sells clothes and fashion items which may not have a very wide and long-lasting ""moat"" around its brand, so it is also possible that their sales will stagnate or even decline in the future.

So once again, there is no Margin of Safety for this stock at the current price-level, and although you may end up with a great return if you buy it, the stock cannot be considered a ""value"" investment at the current price-level.

You can clone the [simulation](https://simsim.run/sim/report?sim_id=66853efca21ab583d51f9a0a) and experiment with different input assumptions. For example, the company has cash of USD 1.9b and no debt, so you could specify some or all of that as excess cash, to see if it makes a big difference in the valuation.

=====================================

**Quotes:**

  
Lululemon Athletica posted a strong quarter driven by growth across international markets, alleviating some concerns that demand for its hundred-dollar leggings was plateauing.

The company’s revenue grew by 10% year over year to $2.2 billion in the quarter ended April 28, in line with projections from FactSet analysts. Top-line growth was driven by a 35% revenue increase from international markets—including a nearly 50% increase in China—while Americas sales rose by 3%.

“We saw strong momentum in our international markets, demonstrating how our brand continues to resonate around the world,” said CEO Calvin McDonald. “Guests responded well to our product innovations across categories, and we are pleased by the progress we are making to optimize our U.S. product assortment.”

. . . .

For the full year, Lululemon now sees earnings per share ranging between $14.27 to $14.47 for the fiscal year ending in January. Previous guidance called for earnings to range between $14 to $14.20 a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of $14.13 a share.

Its sales guidance, however, was unchanged for the full year. It still sees revenue ranging between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Wall Street projections call for $10.8 billion in revenue.

Lululemon stock jumped 11% to $341.35 in after-hours trading Wednesday. The shares are down 40% this year as of Wednesday’s close.

At the heart of the pullback was a growing fear that the company won’t be able to grow sales at a fast enough clip in the long run to justify its premium valuation. After two consecutive years of growing annual sales by over 20%, the company’s latest guidance calls for sales to increase between 11% and 12% year over year.

1d6hfw0_V,V,Why LULU is set to rebound 🚀,"Ever wondered where that one good play is? That one gamble you‘d throw your whole life savings at? Well you sick apes if you listened to me last friday your calls would be already worth +30% . https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/vYojHVvnHl

So here‘s why I YOLOed my whole life savings into long term LULU calls (exp JUN07):

The market overreacted after the last earnings report, causing the stock to crash. Historically, the stock is now significantly undervalued. And looking at the chart, LULU has only dipped deeply below $300 ONCE, back in 2020. For the past four years, it has ALWAYS rebounded quickly from the $300 level, making this a prime buying opportunity for you apes.

LULU also has a solid financial health, a strong market position, and high-profit margins. Their new products hit stores in May, which bodes well for the next earnings report. Regarding the product officer who left a few days ago: yes he left but that won't impact next week's earnings, not even Q2 but it will have effects in 2025. There’s no way this stock won’t go up after pricing in the worst of the worst

TLDR: LULU‘s weakness is overstated. They have great fundamentals, solid financial health, consistently beat estimates, and after the market's overreaction last time, the stock is poised to rebound. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

. . . . .   

Here’s the latest fashion newsflash: younger Americans are swapping out skinny jeans for oversize, baggy pants.  
  
That could hurt companies such as Lululemon Athletica while giving a sales boost to denim-based retailers, Barclays says, as shoppers spend less on form-fitting leggings.    

. . . . . 

Long-term, athleisure still has room to run as people continue to prioritize wellness and casual apparel, Yih added, and Lululemon will likely remain a leader in the space. But the shift in silhouettes means the company may need to pivot some of its core offerings to adjust to the new style demands—and that may take more than a few quarters to execute, she wrote.

. . . . . 

Yih’s analysis echoes recent comments made by longtime Lululemon bear Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies. Earlier in April, Konik noted that interest for wide-leg pants rose 21% year-over-year in 2023, which poses a risk for Lululemon given that this fashion trend is outside of the company’s core

Quotes ON:

============================================================================

Underpants armageddon descended on Wall Street this past Tuesday, as shares of Calvin Klein owner PVH dropped 22%. Hanesbrands sagged some 11% in sympathy.    

. . . . . .

PVH got hit harder than others for three reasons. First, it has outsize exposure to Europe—nearly half of revenues. Second, it’s getting proactive there. Management says it will cut 30% of the online platforms it sells through, and eliminate online third-party sellers altogether, in an effort to support pricing and profit margins. This made for off-putting financial guidance: Overall sales are likely to drop by 6% to 7% this year. Wall Street was predicting a decline of closer to 2%.    

. . . . . .

The PVH stock blowup was as much about giving back easy gains as it was about the news itself. Investors were ready for a long-awaited march toward greater efficiency and respectable margins. Now they’ll have to wait. That raises the question of whether shares at a recent 11 times this year’s projected earnings are a good deal.       
  
There are bright points. Fourth-quarter sales and profits beat estimates. Operating margin was the highest on record for a fourth quarter. Management says that its path from full-year operating margin of 10.1% to its 2015 target of 15% is “fully intact, even if it may take a year or two longer.” Inventory is sharply lower. Both key brands are growing.       

. . . . . .

I have a fashion footnote about feet, or at least, legs. Levi Strauss shares sold off with apparel on Tuesday, but then soared on Thursday after reporting market share gains and issuing raised guidance. Management noted that it’s seeing rapid growth in “loose fits” for men and women, with both up 40% in its latest quarter.        
  
Jefferies analyst Randal Konik calls this a dire sign for tights maker lululemon athletica. “Fashion in bottoms is shifting to wide-leg,” which is not a strength for lulu, he writes. Worse: “The athletic supercycle appears to be over.” Remind me to towel off the Peloton.        
  
A past market collapse for Under Armour could be a preview of what’s in store for lulu, according to Konik. He predicts a decline of more than a third.

We're pricing everything like its Nvidia, so when a company merely does great (comparatively) and isn't 3x'ing every quarter the speculation deflates so quickly ON POSITIVE EARNINGS. When we are at the point where stock prices reflect speculation on exponential future growth, any indication of slow down IN GROWTH collapses a stock, thats how you know we are in a bubble. With an astronomical P/E in the 60's before today, 16% Sales Growth YoY isn't enough in this market. I think LULU is just a demonstration of what could happen to many other tickers that are pricing in decades of double digits growth when a company magically can't maintain that rate of growth.

** accidental graphic is from the link from adidas ceo saying that China was recovering.. 

Regarding Nike, today’s news wasn’t unexpected as the warnings (Sam Poser from Williams Trading) came as early as last week that the company was gonna miss. 

Actually the numbers wasn’t so bad, sales was flat and earning beat, that US and China sales were up was unexpected (Europe and Converse were down),  and it caused an initial bump up of the share price.

But the share price dropped 5-6% AH when the company forecasted that fy2025 was going to be soft in the first half and sales was going to decline by single digit in 1H and only pick up only in 2nd half of fy2025. 

Well it sounds terrible until you realise that Nike’s financial year is from June to May, which means that the calendar year 2024 is a Zzzz year while they try and fix the problem.

I will probably sit tight with my 0.5% portfolio of Nke and buy some more after the swoon.

I see a couple of catalysts here:

- Paris Olympics. 
- Continued business recovery in China. ( adidas ceo [commented](https://www.ft.com/content/d1bf3d32-176f-4110-a04d-4448268d1946) last week he was bullish on China) 

Regarding Lulu, they fell 10% AH due to guidance. The difference between the two is that Nike has been falling all of last year while the inverse is true for Lulu.

I will do some DD on Lulu later today, I want to be convinced that Lulu isn’t a fad and more of a lifestyle choice like Nike. 

TLDR: if you don’t buy high quality companies when they are cheap, then when do you buy them? Our job, as value investors is to check and see if the problem is temporary or a permanent impairment of the business.

1bkiwcp_LULU,LULU,"Lululemon shares plunge 10% on weak guidance, slowing North America growth","Lululemon on Thursday reported holiday earnings that topped expectations, but the athletic apparel retailer’s guidance came in below estimates as its growth in North America stagnates.

Here’s how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $5.29 vs. $5.00 expected

Revenue: $3.21 billion vs. $3.19 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Jan. 28 was $669.5 million, or $5.29 per share, compared with $119.8 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.21 billion, up about 16% from $2.77 billion a year earlier.

Shares fell about 10% in extended trading Thursday.

Like its peers, Lululemon has been grappling with uncertain demand and a slowdown in discretionary spending that’s hit the apparel space particularly hard. Investors have watched how Lululemon performs in North America, its largest region by sales, as it laps tougher prior year comparisons and contends with consumers who are choosing experiences over goods like clothes and shoes. 

During the quarter, sales rose 9% in the Americas, compared to 29% growth in the year-ago period. While Lululemon is still growing in the region, the rate has slowed down significantly as Lululemon focuses on expanding internationally.

Meanwhile, international sales grew 54% on a reported basis, with sales in China growing 78% and 36% in the rest of Lululemon’s markets.

Comparable sales rose 12% during the quarter, just shy of the 12.3% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

For the current quarter, Lululemon expects net revenue to be between $2.18 billion and $2.20 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. Analysts were expecting a forecast of $2.25 billion, or growth of 12.5%, according to LSEG.

It expects diluted earnings per share to be between $2.35 and $2.40, below the $2.55 analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

For the full year, it expects sales to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion, compared with estimates of $10.9 billion, according to LSEG.

It anticipates diluted earnings per share will be between $14 and $14.20 for the year, compared to estimates of $14.13, according to LSEG.

“As you’ve heard from others in our industry, there has been a shift in the U.S. consumer behavior of late and we’re navigating what has been a slower start to the year in this market,” CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts Thursday. “We view this as an opportunity to keep playing offense as we lean into investments that will continue our growth trajectory. Outside the U.S., our business remains strong, and all our international markets in Canada.”

McDonald added that both traffic and conversions are down in the U.S. He attributed that to a lack of products in sizes zero to four, key sizes for the U.S. customer base, and not enough colorful items.

Lululemon has long been one of the market leaders for women’s athletic apparel, but the Vancouver-based company is facing more competition than ever. Newer entrants like Alo Yoga and Vuori have been nipping at Lululemon’s market share, and it’s had to work harder to set itself apart in the more crowded category. 

The retailer has been working to build out its footwear offering and grow its men’s business. During the quarter, it opened its first men’s store in Beijing — a key growth market for the company. In February, it debuted its first men’s sneaker, CityVerse, and plans to launch new running styles for both men and women as performance sneakers continue to be a bright spot in an otherwise stagnant shoewear market. 

Headed into the holidays, McDonald said Black Friday was the “single biggest day” in the company’s history and he was “encouraged” by the trends he was seeing at the start of the season. But the retailer’s holiday-quarter outlook came in a bit short of analysts’ expectations. 

In January, it raised that guidance after it saw sales “balanced across channels, categories, and geographies,” finance chief Meghan Frank said in a news release.

1bk87hj_LULU,LULU,$LULU Earnings Call Play,"Picked up a $LULU call expiring 3/28 ahead of their earnings call today post-market. 🚀

After seeing some WSB regards talking about the slew of weight loss drugs hitting the market last year, being approved by health insurance providers, more women are going to be interested in showing off their bodies. Because of this, and the usual Q4 holiday earnings, I am anticipating a positive earnings report. I'm banking on potential catalysts like revenue growth, margins, and guidance updates. A beat and raise scenario could send the stock up \~$50.

Market sentiment and macroeconomic factors could sway the outcome. It's a calculated gamble, but one with potential for handsome rewards.

So, I'm keeping a close eye on this play, looking for signs of bullish momentum and managing risk accordingly.

Salesforce is higher by about 6.5% this morning, slightly more than the expected move. CrowdStrike is unched, obviously inside the expected move. Dollar General reported this morning and is getting hammered, down 18%. Retailer volatility has been one of the themes of this earnings season. This afternoon we get another retailer in LuluLemon as well as Broadcom and MongDB.

Here's a look at LULU's set-up. Options are pricing about a 6.5% move. That compares to the last 4 moves of +11%, 0%, -13% and +7%. So splitting the difference but more like a mean than a median as 3 of the last 4 moves have been larger than what's expected this event:

166ir9a_LULU,LULU,Everything you need to know about LULU earnings,"Lululemon (LULU) is scheduled to announce Q2 earnings results today, after market close. The consensus EPS Estimate is $2.54 (+15.5% YoY) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $2.17B (+16.0% YoY). Would now be a good time to buy calls? Well, over the last 2 years, LULU has beaten EPS estimates and revenue estimates**88% of the time**.

What do the analysts think? Well just ver the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 16 upward revisions and 6 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 13 upward revisions and 8 downward.

I expect LULU stock to likely trade higher due to revenues and earnings beating market expectations marginally. Retail stocks have continued to come under pressure as economic headwinds coupled with inflation have intensified. Despite the current macro headwinds, Lululemon was able to deliver robust quarterly earnings in Q1 2023. I fully expect a similar momentum in the second quarter results as well. In the 2023 first fiscal quarter, which ended April 30, LULU’s sales increased 24% over last year to $2 billion. Comparable sales increased 13%, and direct-to-consumer revenue, what it calls its digital segment, was up 17% more than last year. However, Digital accounted for 42% of sales, compared with 45% last year. Lululemon’s balanced omnichannel options are an important element of its performance, and that’s even clearer now as the digital presence and physical stores are having a see-saw moment in how shoppers spend their money. The company remains on track to achieve its [Power of Three](https://corporate.lululemon.com/media/press-releases/2019/04-24-2019-090026432) goals it unveiled back in April 2022. The plan aims to roughly double its annual revenue from $6.3 billion in fiscal 2021 to $12.5 billion by fiscal 2026.

Notably, LULU stock had a Sharpe Ratio of 1.0 since early 2017, which is higher than the figure of 0.6 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds. I'd value the stock at $390 (currently at around $380). 

**What do the experts think?**

Analyst [John Kernan](https://www.cowen.com/profile/john-kernan/) from TD Cowen is bullish on the stock. Last week, he reaffirmed a Buy rating on LULU, with a price target of $531. The analyst believes Q2 was quite challenging for the apparel sector but that Lululemon performed well individually. Kernan sees the potential for LULU's management to raise their full-year guidance, with “room to express confidence in near- and long-term targets both in North America and International.”

Additionally, KeyBanc analyst [Noah Zatzkin](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/noah-zatzkin/) maintained a Buy rating on LULU stock and raised the stock's price target to $425 from $400. The analyst expects Lululemon’s 2023 sales to increase by 17%. In a research note to investors on July 25, Zatkin said that LULU is well-poised to benefit from increasing brand awareness, international expansion, and the introduction of new/innovative products.

“While the macro environment has become increasingly challenging, we’ve seen that high momentum brands have continued to perform well,” wrote Wedbush analyst [Tom Nikic](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/TomNikic/) in a Wednesday note. Lululemon is one of those brands, he added.

[Piper Sandler analyst Abbie Zvejnieks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbie-zvejnieks-173b18139) agrees, writing that recent [product launches](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lululemon-athletica-stock-price-belt-bag-8a341b68?mod=md_stockoverview_news&mod=article_inline) and back-to-school shopping have boosted store visits. Indeed, Lululemon’s foot traffic in the U.S. grew by double-digits every month in the third quarter, and far outpaced traffic among the broader sportswear and sporting goods sector, according to [data](https://www.placer.ai/blog/sports-away-lululemon-nikes-momentum-continues) from Placer.ai. Sales in China could also be a bright spot, Zvejnieks added, thanks to the company’s efforts to tailor its products to local markets.

**What to do for Earnings?**

Earnings season has been rough on other companies in the athletic wear space. Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL), for instance, both plummeted in the wake of weak reports. But I think it'll be different for LULU. Options traders are pricing in LULU stock to move by ±7.5% after reporting earnings. The anticipated earnings move is determined by checking the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to the expiration after the earnings announcement. Last quarter, the stock rose by 11.3% after the company delivered better-than-expected results for the first quarter. This quarter I'm gonna go ahead and grab calls. Lululemon's push for new product introductions and enhanced brand awareness may further drive its expansion. Additionally, the company's ambition to expand globally has the potential to elevate its top-line revenue.",2023-08-31,69,55

166b0mg_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves, Lululemon, Broadcom and MongoDB","A couple of earnings of note after the close yesterday. Salesforce is higher by about 6.5% this morning, slightly more than the expected move. CrowdStrike is unched, obviously inside the expected move. Dollar General reported this morning and is getting hammered, down 18%. Retailer volatility has been one of the themes of this earnings season. This afternoon we get another retailer in LuluLemon as well as Broadcom and MongDB.

Here's a look at LULU's set-up. Options are pricing about a 6.5% move. That compares to the last 4 moves of +11%, 0%, -13% and +7%. So splitting the difference but more like a mean than a median as 3 of the last 4 moves have been larger than what's expected this event:

15ypp52_LULU,LULU,Lululemon (LULU): When and how did it get so big?,"I don’t know much about athletic apparel in general other than everyone is trying to catch Nike. Lululemon is a company I never heard of until I entered the market during the pandemic. Next thing I know, it’s a company that can’t stop printing money.

I’m looking at the financials, and they’re impressive: more cash than debt, super strong revenue growth, high projections (take them for what they’re worth). The ratios are a bit high, but their stores always seem to be drawing crowds.

When and how did LULU become the next big brand? Or have I just been living under a rock for too long?",2023-08-23,81,100

13z49cr_LULU,LULU,Nearly $10K+ on Lulu Earnings Gamble,"Thursday few minutes before close I noticed two things -  LULU was beaten down and seemed to be bottoming out, and they had earnings after hours.

Very little TA went into this trade, it was really a last minute impulse. As a side note my wife is a Yoga instructor and I appreciate how Lulus accentuate her wonderful T&A.  So theres that...

Around 350PM EST Thursday I figured what the heck and started putting limit orders for 340 calls expiring June 16 at around $1k a peice.  Typically with big $ (for me) calls, i will add limit buys around $50 bux lower since there is a fair amount of swing in the option price. I had two limit buys and ended up getting a total of 3 340 calls june 16.

I also put a limit buy in for 100 shares. This was just to play earnings with and not long term. Set a limit of 327.50 and lo and behold she executed prior to close.

Then the waiting game after close, initially it bounced down, but then started swinging up rapidly. I didn't really do the math but I wanted to put a safe limit sell  and not miss it so I kind of arbitrarily chose 350. Obviously I could of made more, but I was super stoked I had just made about $2500 in a very short amount of time.

After hours price went up around 370 and i was giddy with anticipation for the next morning. WOke up early AF out here (341 AM hawaii time) and was sad to see she lost some of the oomph she had pre market (hit 383 i believe) but I was happy enough to unload two of my calls for a quick \~5200 bux. I wanted to hold the last one as I was thinking of executing assuming i could scrounge up the money to actually purchase 100 shares, but to my shagrin the price stayed relatively steady until continuing lower towards EOD. When she hit around 370 one last time little past noon EST I unloaded the last call for another \~2200 bux.

And there was a bonus to already good day as I had been buying and selling CROX 110 calls making good money first unloading most Monday then getting more Wednesday/Thursday. Crox got pretty beaten down thursday but i believe LULU helped lift CROX up and I unloaded 23 of my crox calls.  Almost $4k on crox this week:

 For the week, +16,790.24. YTD before this i was probably -3%. now up 14%. Yes i know not as good as the nasdaq ytd :)

LIke a true degen, I splurged some of my winnings on (3) Lulu 400 October calls! down 10% so far lol.  Grabbed some 400 SPY Oct puts and some UVXY calls as well to hedge.  I think if SPX hits 4300 were going down a bit!

12kl14g_LULU,LULU,Lulu might be the riskiest stock in the Apparel industry,"The fashion industry is typically not at the core of most investors' portfolio, but Lulu Lemon delivered strong Q4 earnings and their stock has been skyrocketing these last few years. If you hold LULU, I suggest that you sell, and I will do my best to outline the reasons for this below.

**Full disclosure**, I work in the fashion industry for a big market player which is technically a competitor to LULU, but I do not hold any positions in either company or the apparel industry, nor have I anything to gain by writing this. The below is not based on insider knowledge and simply by my observations from publicly available information.

The stock price of LULU has increased rapidly over the last few years, in part due to strong growth, and in part due to hype.

Here are some examples from the competition:

Nike: The world's biggest performance and sportswear company with a market cap of $190B reached $37,4B in revenue in 2022. They are strong in multiple product categories and excel in footwear, a product that appeals to all genders and will never go out of style. The financials reflect this with steady Y/Y growth.

PVH Corp: A jack of all trades, its strongest product group is Calvin Klein Underwear. Again, a product category that never goes out of style and appeals to everyone. It reached $9bn in revenue in 2022 and has a market cap of $5,5bn. Similarly with a steady Y/Y growth.

Lulu: originally a women's performance and yoga brand now trying to sell multiple product categories to new markets and new consumer groups. Their strength is in D2C, but their growth has been rapid and trend-driven. In 2022 they hit $8bn in revenue and has a market cap of **$46bn**

Their goal is to double their 2021 revenue by 2026, and investors seem confident that they can accomplish this. I believe they will never reach this goal. In fact, I believe their revenue is doomed to decrease. Here are the reasons why I believe this:

* Lululemon's biggest product group is leggings. Leggings are trendy and mostly appeal to women. Contrast this with the aforementioned product categories, leggings are not here to stay, and the Lululemon brand is not ready for a change in consumer behavior.
* LULU is funding their growth largely with debt and has reached a debt to equity ratio of 0.78. This is above average for the industry and contributes to the aforementioned risks.

My experience as a trader is less than my experience as an employee in the fashion industry, so there may be more reasons why LULU is a risky investment, and you may disagree with what I've put forth here. I'm considering a short position in LULU and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",2023-04-13,2,15

125i3zj_LULU,LULU,Lululemon report better-than-expected earnings,"[Lululemon](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LULU/), a Vancouver-based athletic apparel retailer, reported strong holiday-quarter sales with total comparable sales for the fourth quarter increasing by 27%, suggesting that wealthier shoppers are still purchasing yoga pants and tops despite rising prices for essential goods. The company's Q4 revenue rose to $2.77 billion from $2.13 billion a year ago, while earnings per share were $4.40 adjusted compared to $4.26 expected. 

[Lululemon](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LULU/)'s CFO, Meghan Frank, stated that the company remains optimistic about delivering sustained growth and long-term value for its stakeholders. Lululemon has projected a higher EPS and revenue for fiscal year 2023 Q1 than what analysts polled by Capital IQ are expecting. Specifically, Lululemon has projected an EPS of $1.93 to $2 on revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.93 billion, while analysts are expecting an EPS of $1.65 and revenue of $1.85 billion. This suggests that Lululemon is expecting to perform better than what analysts are currently anticipating. However, it is important to note that these are just projections, and actual results may differ.

The athletic apparel retailer based in Vancouver, Lululemon, reported a 27% increase in total comparable sales for the fourth quarter. This metric, also known as same-store sales, takes into account sales from stores that have been open continuously for at least 12 months.

According to Rick Patel, managing director at Raymond James, Lululemon is one of the few companies in this space that has a long pathway for growth and is highly visible. Patel believes that Lululemon's international business and men's business have upside potential, and the company has already overcome its inventory struggles.

[Lululemon](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LULU/) had reported an 85% increase in inventories at the end of the third quarter in December 2022. However, the company announced that inventories were up 50% at the end of 2022, indicating an improvement in inventory management. Raymond James maintains a strong buy rating on the stock, reflecting confidence in the company's growth potential.

The company's stock rose about 11% in after-hours trading following the report.

**Last Week – Another positive week and with it lower IV**

SPY was up 1.4% on the week, less than the 2.6% move options were pricing. However, once again the market had multiple swings and had about. 2.6% range. The week saw an FOMC announcement and some guidance of what’s next, but also saw some mixed signals from Treasury on deposit backstops for the banking industry. The VIX fell from 26 to start the week to 22 to end the week. The banking sector was once again the focus. The regional bank etf KRE had an 8% range for the week but finished the week where it started. XLF saw about a 5.5% range and also finished about unchanged. The 2-year yield closed the week at 3.77%, down slightly on the week and down from 5% on March 7th.

**This Week – GDP and The Fed’s Preferred Inflation Report**

SPY options are pricing about a 2% move for the week. Earnings season is winding down and the next one picks up in Mid-April. In between the market will of course be watching bank stress, but this week also sees the GDP print an important inflation report (PCE) on Friday. The SPY is about 4.5% above its 2023 lows and about 5% off its 2023 highs. With IV a bit lower now, the options market is not currently pricing a move to either level until early May:

The Russell 2000, which saw the largest decline of the market etf’s over the past few weeks saw the largest decline in IV last week. Options are pricing a 2.7% move in IWM this week, compared to nearly 4% last week.

**Last Week – Fed comments still creating market moves**

SPY rose 1.2% last week, less than the 1.5% move options were pricing. The week featured more volatility than the final tally would indicate as it rose about 3.3% from the week’s lows following the positive rate hike comments by Powell on Wednesday. VIX futures are still steeply in contango with Dec around 21 and Feb near 25. SPY option IV is less steep with 30-day IV, 18, 60-day, 19, and 90-day, 20. Powell’s comments moved markets more than the Jobs number and that assumption continues with big volatility assumptions around the Dec FOMC meeting. More on that below.

&#x200B;

**This Week – Low IV for now, with options looking ahead to Dec 14th FOMC**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.3% move for the upcoming week.

Last week, we highlighted how the economic calendar was about to pick up in the first few weeks of December. The Powell speech was the highlight last week, with the Jobs number also seeing a big move lower before a late recovery. This week sees Producer Prices and Consumer Sentiment but the options market is already looking forward to Dec 14th. IV is low for the next week and a half and pricing much larger movement into and out of the FOMC decision. In fact, SPY options are pricing just a 1.5% move out to December 12th, with just 12 IV. Options pick up for the 13th, and the SPY options expiring on December 16th are 21 IV. This is something to keep an eye on for expiry dates and trading over the next 2 weeks as it will also show up in individual stocks (for instance, AAPL Dec 9 options are 22 IV and Dec 16th are 29). Here’s how it looks in SPY, something that looks more like a stock about to report earnings:

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

**Last Week –** After a period of declining volatility and moves in line with expectations volatility roared back and the SPY declined 4.3% on the week, significantly more than the 1.7% move options were pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 2.2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 26, up from 21 last week and 19 the week before. VIX futures are still higher than spot but no longer the steep curve we saw the past few weeks. December futures are near 28 and Jan 2023 and beyond months are all above 28,

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

### In the News

Oil, gas and energy companies are some of the best-performing stocks over the past few months, with some at our near all-time highs. Many top the high RSI (overbought) lists after seeing multi-year lows during the pandemic. For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100.

Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either. There are a lot of moving parts for these stocks right now, the war in Ukraine, a potential recession to name a few., but as volatility has visited both the broader stock market and the oil and gas markets, these stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have ”crashed higher” towards all-time highs without seeing corresponding increases in their own option implied volatility. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge, as put spreads for any reverse in oil prices are cheap (relative to oil itself) on the single name company side of things.

uyumqj_LULU,LULU,Thoughts on $LULU??? Earnings are June 2nd,"LULU's current  IV30 is around 62.7 which means the market expects a significant price movement regarding the volatility, right?? I'm thinking of loading up puts based on earnings and wanna get some outside input depending on what you all think. Furthermore, their current P/E ratio is 34.8 which seems ridiculously high no?

Lululemon fundamentals has been steadily recovered since pandemic hit and overall on or above analysts' estimates. Growth is hurdled by supply chain issues but not the overall sector has been handling it well.

After hitting the high point of $478, LULU stock has been trending down due to the systematic risk, but has shown signs of recovery.  Stock price has been trending up in the past month, whereas IV percentile is also in its high.

ATM straddle exp. Apr. 1 is priced around **$27.5** as of 3:05pm 03.29.22. Implied post-earning price range is **$321 - $376.**  After the last 4 earning events, LULU post-earning price moves landed within implied moves 3 out of 4 times.

Trading Idea:  I think the overall sentiment for Lululemon is bullish, but the price has been trending up going into the earnings so the good news may have been priced in.  So I would take a neutral position and plan to capture the IV crush with an iron condor.

### In the News

Meme/story stocks saw an uptick in activity last week, with unusual options volume and in many cases, increases in implied volatility. Here’s some highlights from last week with special focus on stocks that saw spikes in volume and IV. Many of these stocks had reached low dollar levels, so a quick change in sentiment ramps option volume and prices quickly. Increases of option volume vs 30 day average (on Friday), implied vol vs 360 realized vol (on Friday), and IV Rank that was unusual are indicated. This is by no means an exhaustive list but gives a good sense of what was happening as traders turned their attention to these types of stocks after a long lull:

**BB:** option volume: +600% IV30 vs 1yr: +136%, IV rank: 100% (earnings, expected move this week: 11%)

**BBBY:** IV30 vs 1yr: +148%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11.5%)

**GME:** option volume: +800%, IV30 vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 13.5%)

**NKLA:** option volume: + 400% IV30, vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 9.5%)

**TLRY:** option volume + 2300% IV30, vs 1yr: +207%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 20%)

**CRON:** option volume: 1000% IV:30, vs 1yr +155%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11%)

**ACB:** option volume: +2000% IV30, vs 1yr +194%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 17%)

**RIOT:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 9%)

**FUBO:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 8%)

Whether this is a “dash for trash” towards the end of a big move higher in the broader market or the beginning of a turnaround in fortunes for stocks that had been left for dead remains to be seen. But it’s a reminder of how quickly increasing option volume can lead to large leaps in option prices in stocks with a history of “crashing higher.” Here’s a quick look at how many of these names show up on volume scanners from Friday (via Options AI):

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week down about half a percent (or $2). That was well inside the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. However, SPY traded in a $15 range and was higher by about $10 and lower by about $5 during the week. Implied volatility was higher on the week with the VIX closing on Friday above 30.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 2.4% move (about $11 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY 453.50 that is a range of about 442.50 to 464.50.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 30.50, up from around 28 to start the week. That means expected moves are large (historically) in all the market ETFs, particularly the QQQ and IWM:

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **2.4%** (about $11)
* QQQ **2.9%** (about $11)
* IWM **4.1%** (about $9)
* DIA **2.5%** (about $9)

If the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.

For example: December VIX futures are around 28.50, while Jan and Feb are near 28. May is around 27.50.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

With market implied volatility high, expected moves for earnings need to price the event itself but also the moves of the market in the days up to and after the earnings itself. In other words, when the VIX is 14 an expected move for earnings is almost entirely made up the event move expectations, when the VIX is 30, it needs to also account for a market that is expected to move by itself.

Company Description

Lululemon Athletica designs, distributes, and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth. It operates stores and direct to consumer sections of its business where it originally sold yoga pants and other yoga wear, and has since expanded to sell athletic wear. Lululemon also provides various fitness-related accessories. There are 491 stores internationally as well as its online store that operates globally.  


Quantitative Analysis

At the time of this writing (9/26/2021), LULU is trading at $432.61 with a 52 week range of $269.28 - $437.32 and a market cap of $58.41B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2021, LULU’s revenue grew to $1.5 billion, up 61% year over year. LULU’s diluted earnings per share was $1.59 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.65. Lululemon’s operating margin increased by 110 basis points and adjusted operating margin increased by 160 basis points. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \*100) of LULU is 32.95% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 14.96%.  


Qualitative Analysis

Lululemon has some of the highest quality apparel and is regarded as one of the finest clothing companies in the fitness and athleisure realm. Lululemon also creates high quality and comfortable men’s slacks and with the movement to more remote work and more casual clothing in the office, LULU has a strong hold on comfortable yet professional looking clothing.  


Bullish Thesis

Here are three points to support the bullish thesis:

\- Brand Loyalty in Yoga Wear: Although yoga is one subset of sports and athletic wear, Lululemon has seemed to perform well in this area. Although Lulu has increased competition in the yoga pants realm, they have strong brand loyalty in this sector of their business.

\- Post-pandemic Health Consciousness: We used this argument last week in our article about Peloton, each person is now becoming more health conscious. There is a study that linked extremely high BMIs (45 or greater) with 61% increased risk of death and 33% increased risk of hospitalization compared with healthy weight patients.

\- Mirror Acquisition: Lululemon has made its business around clothing and apparel with the occasional piece of fitness equipment. Now after acquiring a company called Mirror it can begin getting into the interactive fitness equipment space. There is growing competition in the area and Peloton is already a major player in the industry, but Lululemon has a familiar brand name to potential consumers and can poach new customers in a very new industry.  


Bearish Thesis

Here are three points to support the bearish thesis:

\- Competition: The apparel industry is certainly not lacking in competitive companies. In athletic apparel, Lululemon must compete with giants like Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. In non-athletic apparel, they face stiff competition from the likes of Banana Republic, The Gap, and Old Navy, to name a few.

\- Overvalued Stock Prices: Seeking Alpha analysts have expressed concern that Lululemon’s current stock value is overpriced given their likely growth over the next 5-years. According to the analysis, the stock is currently priced as if the company will grow at \~35% per year. In the more likely scenario that the company’s growth will slow post pandemic, the stock value will likely drop to more appropriate levels.

\- High Cost Apparel in an Economic Downturn: A major knock against Lululemon’s apparel is the relatively high cost. Unfortunately for Lululemon, the COVID pandemic and policy decisions made over the last year have left us in a macro environment that may make consumers less likely to spend large sums of money on clothing.

**Broader Market ETFs**

**Last Week** – SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week** – SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.5%**
* DIA **0.8%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move. It's tight, but that's what a 16 VIX looks like vs Condors and other OTM credit spreads.

Covid booster shots are now a topic of conversation and Pfizer (PFE) may be available for a roll-out by the end of September with their FDA review scheduled for the 17th. Moderna (MRNA) will likely lag Pfizer and officials are recommending those that had the Moderna shots to wait for a Moderna booster. There is no timeline yet for review of a Johnson & Johnson booster. Here's how options are pricing expected moves for those three stocks out to October 1st:

**Last Week** – SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week** – SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move.

**Investment Thesis:**

· Lululemon represents a great investment opportunity as they continue their expansion into Asia, Europe, and China.

o If done successfully, this can help Lululemon launch their business to the next level, and drastically improve on their financial reports.

· Furthermore, Lululemon’s desire to grow is also exhibited through their acquisition of MIRROR, which they believe is an extension of their brands principals/image.

o If Lululemon can make changes to this business and scale it, there is another fantastic opportunity for future growth there.

· However, the valuation techniques used in this report argue that Lululemon’s Stock - $LULU, is currently overvalued. My models predict that $LULU price target is $362/share (implying a 9.4% drop).

o There are risks and catalysts that could potentially have large impacts on the share price, and my opinions on them as a company. These risks/catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$LULU – Lululemon Athletica Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/LULU) designs and distributes their athletic apparel, and accessories to their customers worldwide. Lululemon’s goal is to continue to grow their cult-like following around the principals of exercise and health.

Lululemon is actively chasing this goal, which Is evident through their recent purchase of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform with live & pre-recorded classes.

Recently, Lululemon has set their eyes on further expansion into China, Europe, and Asia, which could be very lucrative if done correctly, as these countries/continents have large markets.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

Lululemon has split their business into 2 main segments in their sec filings for reporting purposes. These two segments include their Company-Operated Stores, and their Direct-to-Consumer segment (DTC).

In 2020, their DTC segment represented 52% of their total revenues. This increased drastically from 2019, as in 2019 only 29% of Lululemon’s revenue came from their DTC sales channel. This increase is good to see as an investor as the DTC sales model tends to have better margins, which can help Lululemon’s profitability and help them report better financials.

In 2020, Lululemon’s Company-Operated segment represented 38% of their total revenues. This is a large decrease from their 2019 figure of 63%. Once again this is good to see as DTC tends to be favourable for companies.

This drastic shift away from Company-Operated stores, and to their DTC sales channel can be attributed to COVID-19. Many companies (including Lululemon) were forced to close their stores at the start of the pandemic, these companies were forced to either adapt or be left behind. Luckily for Lululemon, they already had an established DTC model, which helped them to adapt quickly and capture the online market very quickly. As a result of this, Lululemon was able to generate record revenues and increase their margins.

The rest of the revenues not accounted for belong to their “other” segment. This “other” segment includes their revenues from MIRROR, outlet stores, and pop-up stores.

*Company-Operated Stores:*

Despite the pandemic still raging on Lululemon was able to net an increase of 30 stores in 2020. Out of these 30 stores, 10 came from the USA, 17 came from China, 2 came from the UK, 2 came from South Korea, and 1 came from Germany.

If you did the math, you will have noticed that I just listed off 32 new stores, this is because I have not factored in the 2 stores that were closed down over the past year, 1 store in Canada closed, and 1 store in Japan closed.

As we can see from their Company-Operated Stores data, Lululemon is currently expanding into Europe and China. It is likely that we see this expansion continue in China and Europe, as well as a focus on starting to expand into Asia.

*Seasonality:*

Lululemon has acknowledged that their revenues are very seasonal, and that they tend to generate the most revenue in the fourth quarter. This is very common among multiple industries (especially retail) as it is the holiday season. However, Lululemon’s business is much more seasonal than most. This can be observed through their revenues in 2019 and 2020, in which $LULU earnings reported that 47% and 56% of their revenues in these respective years came in the fourth quarter alone.

This is important to know as an investor and is noteworthy especially as we approach $LULU stock earnings for Q4 (likely to be on January 31st, 2022). This jump in revenues is already somewhat priced in, however if we assume that 56% of their revenues comes in Q4 this year than we ca make our own estimate.

Using this 56% figure, we can estimate Lululemon’s Q4 EPS to be $2.74 \[(sum of Q1-Q3)/ (0.44)\] – (Sum of Q1-Q3). This implies that Lululemon will beat their earnings report in Q4 by 10.93% (Q4 EPS estimated to be $2.47 by taking the average of 8 analyst estimates) which may serve to be a catalyst in the future.

*MIRROR Acquisition:*

On July 7th, 2020, Lululemon purchased all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with both live and on-demand classes. It has been reported that this purchase was $500M. Of this $500M, Lululemon has reported that $360M of it is “goodwill”.

For those of you that do not know, “goodwill” is the difference between the purchase price of a business, and that businesses fair value of assets \[= (assets acquired) – (liabilities assumed)\]. In this case, Lululemon paid $350M over the “fair value” of MIRROR, this goodwill is valuable due to the reputation and the brand that the purchased company built.

In their SEC 10-K filing, Lululemon stated that they purchased MIRROR based off of growth, discount, and royalty rates that they believe the can make in the future. This is important as Lululemon believes that they can generate revenues and profits in the future.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Lululemon was able to increase their revenues by 11%, increase their gross profit by 11%, increase their gross margin by 0.1 percentage point, and increase their DTC revenues by 101%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Lululemon increased their cost of revenue by 10% (which is good because the increase in cost of revenue is less than the increase in revenues), their income from operations decreased by 8% (decreased operating margin), their revenues from company-operated stores fell by 34%, and their net income fell by 9%.

· **Overall Financial Performance:** It is rather difficult to give an opinion on whether Lululemon’s financial performance was good or bad in 2020. This is because there were economic factors (ie. COVID-19) that had adverse effects on businesses, which made some companies report “bad” earnings. However, the pandemic also helped many companies transform to digital, or helped companies (ie. Zoom) to have quicker adoption and report very good earnings. This dilemma is very prevalent with Lululemon as many retail and mall stores did horribly through COVID (Lululemon was no exception), however companies that adopted a social media presence and a DTC model were able to perform rather well (ie. Lululemon). Overall, I think that Lululemon had a slightly worse financial performance (as opposed to better). I think this because their DTC model should have helped them to achieve better margins and be more profitable, however the opposite happened and Lululemon’s net income fell.

· **Options Exercised:** In 2020, Lululemon issued 182,000 shares through the exercise of stock options. This issuance had a dilutionary effect of around 0.1%

· **Performance Stock units (PSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon offered 171,000 shares through the vesting of performance-based stock units (PRU’s). These shares are given out to employees based on their performances and goals that they met. The issuance of these shares had a dilutionary effect on Lululemon’s existing common shares of approximately 0.1%

· **Restricted Stock (and shares) Units (RSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon issued a total of 196,000 common shares as a result of the vesting of their Restricted Stock Units. This issuance had a dilutionary effect on existing shares of approximately 0.2%

· **Share Repurchases:** in 2020, Lululemon reported that they repurchased a total of 400,000 shares in 2020 alone. This repurchase offset the majority of Lululemon’s dilution for the year 2020, netting a total of 149,000 shares issued during the year. This brings the total dilution for 2020 down to 0.1%, which is essentially negligible. The fact that Lululemon has little to no share dilution even after acquiring MIRROR is a very good sign for investors and potential investors alike.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses, I needed to find 4 companies that are comparable/similar to Lululemon.

These companies need to exhibit the following characteristics to be considered: be publicly listed, have valid financial ratios/multiples, have similar operations to Lululemon, and be of similar market cap.

By narrowing down the companies based off of the above criteria, I ended up with the following 4 comparable companies:

· [**$GOOS Stock – Canada Goose Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/GOOS) Canada Goose designs, manufactures, and sells their performance and luxury apparel for men and women. Canada Goose sells their products primarily in Canada but also in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Internationally. Canada Goose also sells their apparel in both physical retail stores as well as through their online store (DTC model).

· [**$LEVI Stock – Levi Strauss & Co**](https://utradea.com/stocks/LEVI)**:** Levi Strauss designs, markets, and sells their jeans, shirts, other forms of apparel, and accessories in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Levi’s sells through 3rd party retailers, 3rd party e-Commerce stores, company-operated stores, and their company website (DTC).

· [**$UA Stock – Under Armour Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UA) Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes their apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. Under Armour sells their products through wholesale channels, distributors, and through their DTC channel (e-Commerce store).

· [**$AEO – American Eagle Outfitters Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/AEO) American Eagle is a specialty retailer that provides clothing and accessories to their customers in USA, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, American Eagle is able to ship to 81 countries around the world through their online store (DTC).

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to calculate the WACC through my own models. These models can be found in the DCF model. My WACC model estimated that Lululemon’s WACC is approximately 7.75%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I used a CAGR that was between Lululemon’s gross profit growth rate over the past 5 years, and the average forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 19.26% over the next 5 years.

*CAGR (2029+):*

I estimated lululemon’s CAGR for 2029 and 2030 to be 10 as it seems like a reasonable number given Lululemon’s growth. In the years between 2025 and 2029, I slowly tapered down the growth rate from 19.26% to 10%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2021-2025):*

In order to achieve this figure, I used the same approach as the CAGR. By doing this I arrived t an Operating Expense Increase Rate of 19%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2029+):*

To predict Lululemon’s operating expense growth rate for 2029 and beyond, I decided to use 9%. I did this because the operating expense increase rate has always been relatively close to their CAGR.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past couple of years, Lululemon’s average yearly Depreciation and Amortization growth is 15.47%. I used this historic growth rate to forecast the future growth in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s tax rate to be 28.10% through their SEC 10-K filings.

*Capital Expenditure Growth Rate:*

Over the past couple of years Lululemon’s CAPEX has grown at an average of 2.2% per year. I used this historic rate to forecast their future growth rate.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s risk free rate through a website called Finbox. Finbox estimated that Lululemon’s risk free rate was 2.25%.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

In order to arrive at a $LULU stock price target, I decided to undergo a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In order to compete my DCF model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By doing this, I found Lululemon’s fair value to be $459/share, which implies an upside of 15%. This is quite reasonable; however, it may be a little high and as a result of this I decided to undergo 3 comparable analyses to gather more information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/EBITDA:*

Through comparing Lululemon’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report), I found that $LULU stock price target should be $311/share. If this were the case, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 22%. This is vastly different from the results achieved through the DCF model, so I underwent another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Lululemon’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that Lululemon should have a fair value around $160/share. If this were to come to fruition, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 60%. This is vastly different from the DCF valuation and is even very different from the previous comparable. As a result of this inconsistency, I decided to undergo one final comparable.

*P/E:*

By comparing Lululemon’s P/E ratio to their public competitors, I found them to have a fair value of $324/share, which would imply a downside risk of 19%. This result is somewhat consistent of that achieved through the EV/EBITDA comparable, however as a result of the general inconsistency among comparable analyses, I decided to take the average result from each of them.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses, I arrived at one, all-encompassing comparable valuation of $265/share, which implies a downside risk of 34%

**Plan:**

Due to the inconsistency between the comparable valuation and the DCF valuation, I decided to take the average result in order to draw one price target for Lululemon. By doing this I arrived at an overall $LULU price target of $362/share, which implies a downside risk of 9.4%.

My plan would be to wait for Lululemon to drop 9.4% (or to the $362 price target) before buying in.

I prefer this plan over shorting $LULU because I believe in the long-term prospect of Lululemon, and Lululemon has big reactions to news and is very volatile in the shorter time frames.

**Catalysts:**

· **International Expansion:** We know that Lululemon is looking to expand further in China, Europe, and Asia. These markets are huge and can be very lucrative for Lululemon if they are able to capture this market. If Lululemon does this successfully, their future financial reports should reflect a large increase in revenues due to this expansion, which should excite investors.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon had a subpar financial performance. However, if they are able to fic this and report good earnings for the year 2021, they will get investors excited about the future growth prospect of Lululemon, which should help their price.

· **Q4 Earnings:** Based off of their seasonality I have estimated that Lululemon will beat their expected Q4 earnings. Obviously, I very well could be wrong here, however, if I am right their stock price should be benefitted by beating their earnings estimates.

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon did not have the best financial performance. Although there were some good aspects of it, I felt that the bad outweighed the good and resulted in an overall poor financial performance in 2020. If Lululemon continues on this path of poor financial performances in 2021 then investors may lose faith in Lululemon’s ability to continue their growth, and consequently exit their positions.

· **Seasonality:** As we know, Lululemon has historically experienced seasonality especially in their Q4 financial reports. This kind of seasonality has already been priced in, to a certain extent, however if the seasonality starts to fade and Starbucks misses estimates, their stock could be negatively affected.

otgq6p_LULU,LULU,$LULU is overvalued but will be a good buy if it dips 10%,"**Valuation: Overvalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· Lululemon represents a great investment opportunity as they continue their expansion into Asia, Europe, and China.

o If done successfully, this can help Lululemon launch their business to the next level, and drastically improve on their financial reports.

· Furthermore, Lululemon’s desire to grow is also exhibited through their acquisition of MIRROR, which they believe is an extension of their brands principals/image.

o If Lululemon can make changes to this business and scale it, there is another fantastic opportunity for future growth there.

· However, the valuation techniques used in this report argue that Lululemon’s Stock - $LULU, is currently overvalued. My models predict that $LULU price target is $362/share (implying a 9.4% drop).

o There are risks and catalysts that could potentially have large impacts on the share price, and my opinions on them as a company. These risks/catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$LULU – Lululemon Athletica Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/LULU) designs and distributes their athletic apparel, and accessories to their customers worldwide. Lululemon’s goal is to continue to grow their cult-like following around the principals of exercise and health.

Lululemon is actively chasing this goal, which Is evident through their recent purchase of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform with live & pre-recorded classes.

Recently, Lululemon has set their eyes on further expansion into China, Europe, and Asia, which could be very lucrative if done correctly, as these countries/continents have large markets.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

Lululemon has split their business into 2 main segments in their sec filings for reporting purposes. These two segments include their Company-Operated Stores, and their Direct-to-Consumer segment (DTC).

In 2020, their DTC segment represented 52% of their total revenues. This increased drastically from 2019, as in 2019 only 29% of Lululemon’s revenue came from their DTC sales channel. This increase is good to see as an investor as the DTC sales model tends to have better margins, which can help Lululemon’s profitability and help them report better financials.

In 2020, Lululemon’s Company-Operated segment represented 38% of their total revenues. This is a large decrease from their 2019 figure of 63%. Once again this is good to see as DTC tends to be favourable for companies.

This drastic shift away from Company-Operated stores, and to their DTC sales channel can be attributed to COVID-19. Many companies (including Lululemon) were forced to close their stores at the start of the pandemic, these companies were forced to either adapt or be left behind. Luckily for Lululemon, they already had an established DTC model, which helped them to adapt quickly and capture the online market very quickly. As a result of this, Lululemon was able to generate record revenues and increase their margins.

The rest of the revenues not accounted for belong to their “other” segment. This “other” segment includes their revenues from MIRROR, outlet stores, and pop-up stores.

*Company-Operated Stores:*

Despite the pandemic still raging on Lululemon was able to net an increase of 30 stores in 2020. Out of these 30 stores, 10 came from the USA, 17 came from China, 2 came from the UK, 2 came from South Korea, and 1 came from Germany.

If you did the math, you will have noticed that I just listed off 32 new stores, this is because I have not factored in the 2 stores that were closed down over the past year, 1 store in Canada closed, and 1 store in Japan closed.

As we can see from their Company-Operated Stores data, Lululemon is currently expanding into Europe and China. It is likely that we see this expansion continue in China and Europe, as well as a focus on starting to expand into Asia.

*Seasonality:*

Lululemon has acknowledged that their revenues are very seasonal, and that they tend to generate the most revenue in the fourth quarter. This is very common among multiple industries (especially retail) as it is the holiday season. However, Lululemon’s business is much more seasonal than most. This can be observed through their revenues in 2019 and 2020, in which $LULU earnings reported that 47% and 56% of their revenues in these respective years came in the fourth quarter alone.

This is important to know as an investor and is noteworthy especially as we approach $LULU stock earnings for Q4 (likely to be on January 31st, 2022). This jump in revenues is already somewhat priced in, however if we assume that 56% of their revenues comes in Q4 this year than we ca make our own estimate.

Using this 56% figure, we can estimate Lululemon’s Q4 EPS to be $2.74 \[(sum of Q1-Q3)/ (0.44)\] – (Sum of Q1-Q3). This implies that Lululemon will beat their earnings report in Q4 by 10.93% (Q4 EPS estimated to be $2.47 by taking the average of 8 analyst estimates) which may serve to be a catalyst in the future.

*MIRROR Acquisition:*

On July 7th, 2020, Lululemon purchased all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with both live and on-demand classes. It has been reported that this purchase was $500M. Of this $500M, Lululemon has reported that $360M of it is “goodwill”.

For those of you that do not know, “goodwill” is the difference between the purchase price of a business, and that businesses fair value of assets \[= (assets acquired) – (liabilities assumed)\]. In this case, Lululemon paid $350M over the “fair value” of MIRROR, this goodwill is valuable due to the reputation and the brand that the purchased company built.

In their SEC 10-K filing, Lululemon stated that they purchased MIRROR based off of growth, discount, and royalty rates that they believe the can make in the future. This is important as Lululemon believes that they can generate revenues and profits in the future.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Lululemon was able to increase their revenues by 11%, increase their gross profit by 11%, increase their gross margin by 0.1 percentage point, and increase their DTC revenues by 101%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Lululemon increased their cost of revenue by 10% (which is good because the increase in cost of revenue is less than the increase in revenues), their income from operations decreased by 8% (decreased operating margin), their revenues from company-operated stores fell by 34%, and their net income fell by 9%.

· **Overall Financial Performance:** It is rather difficult to give an opinion on whether Lululemon’s financial performance was good or bad in 2020. This is because there were economic factors (ie. COVID-19) that had adverse effects on businesses, which made some companies report “bad” earnings. However, the pandemic also helped many companies transform to digital, or helped companies (ie. Zoom) to have quicker adoption and report very good earnings. This dilemma is very prevalent with Lululemon as many retail and mall stores did horribly through COVID (Lululemon was no exception), however companies that adopted a social media presence and a DTC model were able to perform rather well (ie. Lululemon). Overall, I think that Lululemon had a slightly worse financial performance (as opposed to better). I think this because their DTC model should have helped them to achieve better margins and be more profitable, however the opposite happened and Lululemon’s net income fell.

· **Options Exercised:** In 2020, Lululemon issued 182,000 shares through the exercise of stock options. This issuance had a dilutionary effect of around 0.1%

· **Performance Stock units (PSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon offered 171,000 shares through the vesting of performance-based stock units (PRU’s). These shares are given out to employees based on their performances and goals that they met. The issuance of these shares had a dilutionary effect on Lululemon’s existing common shares of approximately 0.1%

· **Restricted Stock (and shares) Units (RSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon issued a total of 196,000 common shares as a result of the vesting of their Restricted Stock Units. This issuance had a dilutionary effect on existing shares of approximately 0.2%

· **Share Repurchases:** in 2020, Lululemon reported that they repurchased a total of 400,000 shares in 2020 alone. This repurchase offset the majority of Lululemon’s dilution for the year 2020, netting a total of 149,000 shares issued during the year. This brings the total dilution for 2020 down to 0.1%, which is essentially negligible. The fact that Lululemon has little to no share dilution even after acquiring MIRROR is a very good sign for investors and potential investors alike.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses, I needed to find 4 companies that are comparable/similar to Lululemon.

These companies need to exhibit the following characteristics to be considered: be publicly listed, have valid financial ratios/multiples, have similar operations to Lululemon, and be of similar market cap.

By narrowing down the companies based off of the above criteria, I ended up with the following 4 comparable companies:

· [**$GOOS Stock – Canada Goose Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/GOOS) Canada Goose designs, manufactures, and sells their performance and luxury apparel for men and women. Canada Goose sells their products primarily in Canada but also in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Internationally. Canada Goose also sells their apparel in both physical retail stores as well as through their online store (DTC model).

· [**$LEVI Stock – Levi Strauss & Co**](https://utradea.com/stocks/LEVI)**:** Levi Strauss designs, markets, and sells their jeans, shirts, other forms of apparel, and accessories in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Levi’s sells through 3rd party retailers, 3rd party e-Commerce stores, company-operated stores, and their company website (DTC).

· [**$UA Stock – Under Armour Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UA) Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes their apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. Under Armour sells their products through wholesale channels, distributors, and through their DTC channel (e-Commerce store).

· [**$AEO – American Eagle Outfitters Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/AEO) American Eagle is a specialty retailer that provides clothing and accessories to their customers in USA, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, American Eagle is able to ship to 81 countries around the world through their online store (DTC).

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to calculate the WACC through my own models. These models can be found in the DCF model. My WACC model estimated that Lululemon’s WACC is approximately 7.75%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I used a CAGR that was between Lululemon’s gross profit growth rate over the past 5 years, and the average forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 19.26% over the next 5 years.

*CAGR (2029+):*

I estimated lululemon’s CAGR for 2029 and 2030 to be 10 as it seems like a reasonable number given Lululemon’s growth. In the years between 2025 and 2029, I slowly tapered down the growth rate from 19.26% to 10%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2021-2025):*

In order to achieve this figure, I used the same approach as the CAGR. By doing this I arrived t an Operating Expense Increase Rate of 19%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2029+):*

To predict Lululemon’s operating expense growth rate for 2029 and beyond, I decided to use 9%. I did this because the operating expense increase rate has always been relatively close to their CAGR.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past couple of years, Lululemon’s average yearly Depreciation and Amortization growth is 15.47%. I used this historic growth rate to forecast the future growth in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s tax rate to be 28.10% through their SEC 10-K filings.

*Capital Expenditure Growth Rate:*

Over the past couple of years Lululemon’s CAPEX has grown at an average of 2.2% per year. I used this historic rate to forecast their future growth rate.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s risk free rate through a website called Finbox. Finbox estimated that Lululemon’s risk free rate was 2.25%.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

In order to arrive at a $LULU stock price target, I decided to undergo a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In order to compete my DCF model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By doing this, I found Lululemon’s fair value to be $459/share, which implies an upside of 15%. This is quite reasonable; however, it may be a little high and as a result of this I decided to undergo 3 comparable analyses to gather more information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/EBITDA:*

Through comparing Lululemon’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report), I found that $LULU stock price target should be $311/share. If this were the case, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 22%. This is vastly different from the results achieved through the DCF model, so I underwent another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Lululemon’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that Lululemon should have a fair value around $160/share. If this were to come to fruition, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 60%. This is vastly different from the DCF valuation and is even very different from the previous comparable. As a result of this inconsistency, I decided to undergo one final comparable.

*P/E:*

By comparing Lululemon’s P/E ratio to their public competitors, I found them to have a fair value of $324/share, which would imply a downside risk of 19%. This result is somewhat consistent of that achieved through the EV/EBITDA comparable, however as a result of the general inconsistency among comparable analyses, I decided to take the average result from each of them.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses, I arrived at one, all-encompassing comparable valuation of $265/share, which implies a downside risk of 34%

**Plan:**

Due to the inconsistency between the comparable valuation and the DCF valuation, I decided to take the average result in order to draw one price target for Lululemon. By doing this I arrived at an overall $LULU price target of $362/share, which implies a downside risk of 9.4%.

My plan would be to wait for Lululemon to drop 9.4% (or to the $362 price target) before buying in.

I prefer this plan over shorting $LULU because I believe in the long-term prospect of Lululemon, and Lululemon has big reactions to news and is very volatile in the shorter time frames.

**Catalysts:**

· **International Expansion:** We know that Lululemon is looking to expand further in China, Europe, and Asia. These markets are huge and can be very lucrative for Lululemon if they are able to capture this market. If Lululemon does this successfully, their future financial reports should reflect a large increase in revenues due to this expansion, which should excite investors.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon had a subpar financial performance. However, if they are able to fic this and report good earnings for the year 2021, they will get investors excited about the future growth prospect of Lululemon, which should help their price.

· **Q4 Earnings:** Based off of their seasonality I have estimated that Lululemon will beat their expected Q4 earnings. Obviously, I very well could be wrong here, however, if I am right their stock price should be benefitted by beating their earnings estimates.

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon did not have the best financial performance. Although there were some good aspects of it, I felt that the bad outweighed the good and resulted in an overall poor financial performance in 2020. If Lululemon continues on this path of poor financial performances in 2021 then investors may lose faith in Lululemon’s ability to continue their growth, and consequently exit their positions.

· **Seasonality:** As we know, Lululemon has historically experienced seasonality especially in their Q4 financial reports. This kind of seasonality has already been priced in, to a certain extent, however if the seasonality starts to fade and Lululemon misses estimates, their stock could be negatively affected.

o3nl1a_LULU,LULU,LULU to $400?,"https://i.imgur.com/D8WURWh.png

LULU just broke out its 200-day moving average and resistance level. DeMark indicators show bullish signs and the stock might be on its way up to its ATH of $400.

nrwb5v_LULU,LULU,Lululemon earnings: Revenue jumps 88%,"Lululemon sales surged 88 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.2 billion as bricks and mortar stores reopened, prompting the athletic apparel company to raise its financial outlook for the year. 

The Vancouver-based company, which reported earnings after markets closed on Thursday, said net sales hit $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up from $651 million during the same time last year. Lululemon also reported a net income of $145 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $29 million last year, or 22 cents per diluted share. 

""Our first quarter results reflected strength across all drivers of growth, fuelled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business and a rebound in brick and mortar stores,"" chief executive Calvin McDonald said in a statement released after markets closed on Thursday. 

""Our strong performance across categories, channels and geographies demonstrates the momentum and strength of Lululemon as we shift into the new normal.""

Lululemon said traffic to its bricks and mortar stores increased significantly in the first quarter of the year, with 93 per cent of the company's retail stores open by the end of the three month period. 

The company also saw growth in both its women's and men's categories. Sales of women's products increased 23 per cent when compared to 2019 sales, and men's sales jumped 27 per cent compared to 2019.

McDonald expects that momentum to continue, even as economies reopen and customers begin to resume normal routines. He said sales growth has continued, even as consumers shift their daily habits. 

""We have not seen a meaningful shift in our activewear categories through the first quarter,"" McDonald said. 

""The big piece of our business and sales are in athletic activewear. I think with that, it has embedded strength to not be purely trend driven or fashion driven... Overall growth is across almost every category and is very balanced across geographies."" 

The stronger-than-expected results pushed Lululemon to raise its sales targets for the full fiscal year. The company now expects net revenue to be between $5.83 billion and $5.91 billion in 2021, up from its prior range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Lululemon also expects adjusted earnings to be between $6.73 and $6.86 per share, compared to a prior range of $6.30 to $6.45. 

The projections surpass what analysts had anticipated. According to IBES data from Refinitiv, analysts had expected net revenue of $5.68 billion and earnings of $6.48 per share.

lpc8fv_LULU,LULU,Lululemon (LULU): The clothes don't go on sale and neither will the stock,"&#x200B;

*Disclaimer: This post is not investment advice. It is for educational purposes only and reflects my opinion. I am long $LULU at the time I wrote this. I make no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of this information. Please consult a professional before making any investment decisions.*

&#x200B;

**SUMMARY**

Lululemon is a highly profitable company with above-average margins, a strong balance sheet, and a clear growth plan. The loyalty of their customer base is driving their growth, and it provides a moat (albeit a weak one) against competitors. LULU remains the clear market leader, with brands like Nike, Under Armour, and Victoria’s Secret Sport struggling to take market share.

However, nothing in today’s market is cheap. Execution and growth come at a price, and in LULU’s case, that price is 38.6x LTM EBITDA, 11.6x LTM Sales, or 83.4x LTM Earnings. LULU’s clothes are not cheap, and neither is their stock.

However, I believe in paying for quality, and LULU is a Company that is executing its growth plan quite effectively. Continued success has the potential to lead to further upside in the stock price.

&#x200B;

**UPDATES TO POWER OF THREE PLAN**

Management outlined a 5-year growth plan in 2018 called ‘Power of Three’. This plan outlined three primary goals for the next 5 years: Double revenue from men’s offerings, double revenue from digital channels, and quadruple international revenue.

Let’s take a look at each goal:

***Double Men’s***

The goal was to double revenue from men’s products from \~$700m when the goal was set (FY 2018) to \~$1.4bn by 2023. As of Q3 2020, LULU earned $900m in revenue from men’s products on an LTM basis. This means they are \~65% of the way towards that goal.

&#x200B;

***Double Digital***

The goal was to double revenue from digital channels from \~$860m in FY 2018 to \~$1.7bn by 2023. Unsurprisingly, COVID helped this goal quite a bit. By Q3 2020, LULU earned >$1.8bn from digital channels, well ahead of the goal.

***Quadruple International***

The goal was to quadruple revenue from international sources from \~$360m in FY 2018 to \~$1.4bn by 2023. LULU earned \~$560m in LTM (Q3 2020). This is on-pace with the current goal, but not as far ahead as the other two. It is worth noting that there were 34 stores open in Asia when this goal was set, and there are now 70 open (with plans to open more). So, the focus and energy are there, it is just taking time.

&#x200B;

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

**DEBT**

$0 in debt\*.

*\*Due to an accounting change (ASC 842 issued by FASB), leases are now held on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes leases as a liability while recognizing an offsetting ‘Right of Use’ asset. As such, the Company technically has long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.*

&#x200B;

**MARGINS**

LULU has impressive margins, especially for a retailer. Gross margins in the mid-50s, and a mid-teens net income margin.

&#x200B;

||2017|2018|2019|LTM (Q3 '20)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Gross Margin|53.1%|55.2%|55.9%|55.6%|
|EBITDA Margin|22.7%|25.1%|26.5%|24.0%|
|Net Income Margin|9.8%|14.7%|16.2%|13.7%|

&#x200B;

**RETURNS**

LULU has generated an attractive return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) for investors historically. While past performance is not indicative of future results (it never is), these figures have stayed consistently attractive over the years. Management has clearly been able to find good investment opportunities to deploy capital towards.

||2017|2018|2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROA|14.2%|23.7%|24.1%|
|ROE|17.5%|31.8%|38.0%|

&#x200B;

**CAPEX**

Even as the number of stores has gone from \~137 in 2010 (this only includes LULU-branded stores) to 515 in Q3 2020, the CapEx to fund these stores has come out of existing cash flow. CapEx as a percent of revenue has consistently stayed in the range of 7% and using Bruce Greenwald’s formula we can estimate that \~1/3rd of the total CapEx is maintenance CapEx, with the rest funding growth.

&#x200B;

**BUYBACKS**

LULU generates enough cash flow to fund growth CapEx while also funding a share buyback program. Since the program was first announced in 2013, LULU has purchased \~$1.5bn of shares, reducing the diluted share count by \~10% from 146m to 130m.

As of Q3 2020, the Board has authorized an additional $500m in share buybacks. Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders while allowing more flexibility than a traditional dividend.

&#x200B;

**MIRROR**

LULU purchased MIRROR, an at-home interactive fitness product, in mid-2020. Management guided analysts to expect a 2020 revenue contribution of $100m. This figure was raised towards the end of last year to $150m. MIRROR, like Peloton, will benefit from the increasing interest in at-home fitness products. MIRROR diversifies LULU’s revenue stream while giving the Company the chance to market directly to LULU customers in their living rooms.

&#x200B;

**COMPS**

Compared to comps, LULU is quite expensive. My comps group includes the companies listed at the bottom of the post.

&#x200B;

||EV / Revenue|EV / EBITDA|EV / EBIT|P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**LULU**|**10.9x**|**45.5x**|**55.8x**|**79.5x**|
|Median|2.7x|15.3x|56.2x|79.5x|
|Mean|3.6x|19.4x|81.7x|78.9x|

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

As I mentioned in the beginning, LULU is not cheap. This isn’t an undervalued opportunity. Instead, this is an excellent company that is hitting (and exceeding) its growth targets. It’s impossible to know what will happen to multiples or the stock price, but LULU appears to be a strong company that I would like to own (and, full disclosure, I do!).

Someone recently did [a great DD on LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klxhx6/lulu_to_the_moon_and_here_is_why/). I want to add a few things:

\- The stock price has been struggling in the past 3 months (down 5%) but has started an upward trend last week.

\- Q4 earnings coming out on 3/25, and given how busy the stores were during the holidays can bet it's going to be awesome.

\- Currently, the most popular (highest open interest) option for this stock (across all expiration dates and strikes) is 380C 3/19/2021, so it seems smart money is betting on a big move prior to the earnings (although it's possible these positions were opened mid last year when the stock price was higher.)

 These are NOT naked calls, your leap covers it, you can sell calls at any strike above the one you bought at (which is why its good to buy ITM as you won't get shit selling weekly calls on a strike 10-20% above the underlings price)

ilf5xf_LULU,LULU,Trade Diary: LULU Earnings play,"I have traded LULU fairly consistently for awhile; generally in a bullish manner by selling put credit spreads.

With earnings being released next week, I decided to make a different trade.

SETUP:  
Yesterday morning LULU was trading for \~$380 when I entered this trade.  

I wanted to enter a bullish trade for earnings with more upside.  I like to get in a week early so I can exit on a pre-earnings run up if one occurs.  I looked at the 9/25 calls because the IV was a bit lower there than the weeks before and after.  I wanted something in the 390-400 range to account for a 5% run.  I didn't want to go over 400 because of potential psychological resistance.  

395c were 14.84 and fit my goals.

I also sold 9/4 395 at 1.54 to lower the cost basis.  This would hopefully cover me if the stock was flat all next week and I just burned theta.  

So my max risk was 13.30; the amount I paid to enter the trade.

MODIFICATION:  
LULU decided to run the past two days; closing at 398 today.  So I was sitting with both positions ITM.  I was left with three choices:

1) hold and hope the stock moves back under 395 by Fr so I can continue the original plan;

2) close the trade for a profit at some point between now and Fr, which would be functionally similar to 1 as I would wait to get the full extrinsic value of the sold call back and close late Fr;

3) modify; I could roll it out one week and to a 400c for a credit of 13.64.

I picked 3.

CURRENT STATUS

I have the diagonal spread in a bullish position; long 395c 9/25; short 400c 9/11.

While this is not a position I would currently open, it is a good place to be.  I am still in a bullish position, but more importantly, I have zero risk.  My current cost basis is a .04 credit.

My delta is weak (+3), but my theta is good (+54).  

FUTURE HANDLING:

If LULU continues to run, I will have the option of rolling out the short call more.  If it gets to \~410 I should profit \~13.00 that way.  

If I hold through a bad earnings and it crashes, I will profit whatever value remains in the 395c post earnings.

The immediate 5% increase has actually taken away a lot of my upside, but I have eliminated any downside.  And I can work with that.",2020-09-02,4,6

Note that these companies and especially their physical stores will take massive hits as the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading across the world and forcing countries to shut down or shut down again, with another dip in their share price likely coming (then again, nobody knows that in the current market).

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
First off, the biggest of the four with a 120 billion dollar market cap, Nike (NKE). A giant of the sport's industry and partnered with some of the biggest stars and teams in sport, Nike has double the market cap of their closest competitor Adidas. They have made their name is an innovative, high quality and flexible company, able to meet changing market sentiment and make sure they hold on to their title as king of the hill.

Their share price was close to reaching new all time highs before pulling back a bit in the last few weeks. They have a lot of cash to work with but also the most debt of any company on the list, but because they also bring in the most net income and have a great revenue stream, this debt is not much of a problem for them. They are a combination of a relatively stable major cap company with enough growth potential to see rise even more in the coming years.

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Second, German giant Adidas (ADDYY), coming in with a market cap of just around 50 billion dollars. After initially lagging behind their biggest rival Nike at the start of this year, they have made up ground in part because of their deal with star artist Kanye West, who's Yeezy line of shoes turned out to be a massive success. With the ever growing popularity of sneaker collecting and flipping, having these shoes in your arsenal helps a lot. Adidas is also expanding well into emerging markets like Africa and Asia, while simultaneously taking pieces of market share in North America, where Nike still rules supreme.

While their share price has recovered a decent amount since the lows seen in march, they are still trading well below all time highs and could be a good investment if you believe they will reach those highs again, which seems likely for this sportswear giant.

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Third, the smallest of the 4 with a market cap of around 4 billion dollars, 'new kid on the block' Under Armour (UA). Praised for the innovative clothing line and modern outlook, they have fallen down quite a bit from the heights of their 2015 highs of over 50 dollars per share. A combination of questionable management, bad investments and lack of innovative products to disrupt the market has left them struggling. The recent success of their sports face masks do show that they still got a bit of the touch that once had them talked about as a threat to Nike and Adidas, but much more is needed if they are to challenge for that title again.

As of right now, they are still trading well below their 52 week high and are struggling with negative net income and a balance sheet that is less than great. Although analysts think they will return to positive growth in the next few years, a significant tail wind is needed for this.

Lastly, seemingly the most popular sports brand of the last 5 years, Lululemon (LULU) with a market cap of just under 40 billion dollars. Lululemon has created something of a loyaling following in the US. Where their sharp design and high quality clothing has been popular both as sports clothing as well as regular wear. They are also working on expanding into stay at home fitness, apparent from their 500 million dollar purchase of fitness start-up Mirror. The combination of brand loyalty and diversification is set to serve them well as they expand their brand outside of North America as well.

With growing net income, a good balance sheet and an amazing share growth over the past 5 years they are well positioned to come out of this crisis and thrive like they did beforehand. The only concern one could have is that their huge jump from march lows was a bit overdone and that they are due for a correction.

Final verdict:
Under Armour is the clear loser of these four stocks, with the worst balance sheet and net income. Yes they are trading well below their 52 week high, but that means nothing if they can't turn the ship around and become profitable again.

As for what I would pick, I have to go with Adidas as of this moment. While Nike is the biggest company in the sector and Lululemon is growing their business at an incredible rate, both of these companies have recovered greatly and given the crisis is showing no signs of stopping just yet, it could be argued they are overvalued at the moment. 

Adidas on the other is still trading well below 52 week highs, are expanding well in some of the biggest markets in the world, are less prone to US volatility since they are based in Germany and have plenty of room to run into before reaching the 120 billion dollar market cap Nike is sitting at. Will they reach this? Only time can tell, but they are doing all the right things and they are (in my opinion) the best investment of these four sportswear giants.

My thoughts: On paper this seems not to be a bad deal - it appears Mirror is inching near profitability, has significant revenue and MAU. Other players in the at-home fitness space like Peloton have fared well in these recent corona times. Lululemon and other fitness-wear companies have had their sales affected recently, but diversifying into the fitness tech space may be somewhat of a wise hedge.

I came across 2 interesting plays today on my UOA scanner that I thought you all might find interesting!

**W - Wayfair Inc**

Player opened up a synthetic long position, where they buy the call and sell the put at the same strike. This kind of strategy ultimately has the same risk as going long on shares. What they did: They bought 2,600 July 17 calls at the $205 strike and sold 2,600 July puts at the $205 strike. Total dollars involved in the transaction was approximately $6.8 million in premium, which is quite a large position! I will be interested to follow the stock as those are relatively short-term expirations and they are expecting a big move up.

&#x200B;

**LULU - Lululemon Inc**

Minutes before the closing bell a player purchased 1,000 call contracts at the $305 strike for July 2nd expiration and a total premium of about 100k. Shortly after the close LULU announced they are acquiring fitness startup MIRROR. LULU is up 3% after-hours. Very cool and very legal \*inserts sunglasses emoji\*

gt5151_LULU,LULU,Lululemon - why the lack of share price growth from 2011-2017?,"Hi everyone.

I'm curious as to why Lululemon's share price failed to grow from 2011 to 2017, but suddenly rocketed in 2018. 

2011.....                                           .....2019

179 287 376 391 376 369 421 456 706

This is their history of net income. In 2012 they reached a share price of approx $75. This remained stagnant over the next 4 or so years, which is understandable because net income growth was essentially non existent after 2013. After 2016, their net income started to grow again. In 2019, it reached 706. 

The growth from 179 to 287 (2011 to 2012) is about 60%. The growth from 421 to 706 is roughly 70%.

Yet the share price growth from 2011 to 2012 was about 120%, compared to the share price growth  from 2017 to just before covid of 358% ish.

Would someone be able to give me some insight into why the share price growth is so different, even though earnings growth was relatively strong in both? Or is this a case of the market being inefficient?

I found a LULU call that is perfectly priced for an earnings play. The retail sector has been killing it and this BECKY train isn't stopping anytime soon.

Recommended: [9/20 $200 Calls](https://ibb.co/3s6bwQz)

I can only afford 1 currently because I also have TEUM, KL, and SPY calls.

9vkkyz_LULU,LULU,Briefing Report: LULU,"The Target is LULU. Scheduled to enter LULU positions on Mon 11.12.2018

There are 3 PDFs below - please read and study in the sequence provided:

1. LULU Fundamental Analysis briefing.
2. LULU Technical Analysis briefing.
3. LULU Options Analysis briefing.

Strategy: Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread and is designed with very specific Objectives:

4. To exploit true Dominant Trend bullish continuation moves after Pull-Back phases and allow Price Action to hit Weekly & Monthly Target Levels that truly provide High R options call gains.

5. But Pull-Backs can lead to deeper Pull-Backs. But using this Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread strategy - when we enter into the Pull-Back zone - and do so with a Net Credit Entry Basis, then even if the LULU Pull-Back goes deeper yet - the position will suffer NO LOSS - but instead gain a marginal (+$100 to $120) per (+3)/(-1) spread arrangement. Each (+3)(-1) spread requires about $3400 Margin.

Here are the Summary Specific Expected Results for LULU - just remember this will be for each $3400 Margin for placing a (+3)(-1) Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread position:

LULU is at $142.27 ----> Earnings Date is 12.05.2018 which is about 25 calendar days out. The LULU Options IV is HIGH at the 83%ile IV Ranking.

LULU had two Price Gaps upside over the past few months - and recently at the current Pull-Back - LULU has closed Gap 1. There is a 2nd Gap at the $108.37 price level.

After you read the detailed Briefings of the 3 PDFs - you should be able to SEE these 1st BINARY EVENT OUTCOMES expected:

6. Outcome 1 ----> LULU goes higher from $142.27 to hit Target 1 at $180.79 (profit +$2124 per $3400 Margin) ----> if hit Target 2 at $199.49 (profit +$5140 per $3400 Margin). So if you use a Betting Level of $10k (actually $10.2k) for a (+9)(-3), and if LULU moves upside from here ----> at Target 1 of $180.79 the estimated profit is (+$6300) and at Target 2 of $199.49 the estimated profit is (+$15.3k).

-- OR --

7. Outcome 2 ----> LULU moves lower to CLOSE Gap #2 down to the $108.37 to $110 Confluence Support Level ----> then the (+3)(-1) Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread will NOT SUFFER LOSSES ---> instead is estimated to have a very small profit of (+$100 to $120) per $3400 Margin or per (+3)(-1) or if you use (+9)(-3) ----> then even with DIRECTIONAL BET 100% WRONG ----> can still have a small profit estimate of (+$300 to +$360).

If Outcome 2 happens and LULU moves down to $108.37 to $110 price zone ----> then we can re-establish a new (+3)(-1) per $3400 Margin spread again at the lower level AND DO SO WITH $0 out-of-pocket to your account! In addition the original long (+3) calls of the (+3)(-1) per $3400 Margin will still be open and ""free"".

Then at the $108.37 to $110 Confluent Support Zone ----> LULU can really be expected to move back higher toward the $180 and $199 Target 1 & 2 levels. At this point - with the new (+3)(-1) spreads opened when LULU is at $110 ----> your $$$ returns will be very high.

Remember - if LULU explodes higher after Earnings on 12.04 or 12.05.2018 ----> and LULU hits $199.47 Target 2 ----> on a $10k betting using a (+9)(-3) strategy - you stand to profit estimate at ($15K+).

I hope you can appreciate the detailed PDF briefing reports - and see the powerful (+3x)(-1x) Bullish Call Diag Back-Spread Plan for LULU.

Please do not hesitate to ask me your questions, potential LULU scenarios, Options-related issues, etc

7g6isi_LULU,LULU,Going long $LULU,"I've had my eye on this one for a while. I took a sizable position in the stock a couple of months ago during a sell-off at $58 and ever since it's been rallying and today is around $67. They report earnings next week which I think could serve as a major catalyst to another leg up. Was hoping for a slight pullback going into earnings to present a more attractive buying opportunity, and that may happen, but I think it's just as likely that it trades up ahead of earnings so I decided to pull the trigger today.

So with that in mind I went for the March 18 $72.50 calls which I got at $3.00. I plan to hold these for 3-4 weeks regardless of what happens post earnings. If they do beat and the stock moves up significantly, I'll probably get out of these and move them up and out.

Quick summary of why I'm bullish:

* Absolute category leader in athleisure, which pretty much every other apparel company is falling over themselves to get into

> **Lululemon** — The yoga wear maker's stock is getting slammed after an earnings miss and a weak forecast. Lululemon fell a penny a share short of forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share, and its current-quarter guidance of 25 to 27 cents per share falls well short of the 39 cents consensus estimate. The company said its spring clothing isn't bold enough and promises to make more attractive gear and clothing to correct the problem.

> **Lululemon** — The yoga wear maker's stock is getting slammed after an earnings miss and a weak forecast. Lululemon fell a penny a share short of forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share, and its current-quarter guidance of 25 to 27 cents per share falls well short of the 39 cents consensus estimate. The company said its spring clothing isn't bold enough and promises to make more attractive gear and clothing to correct the problem.

3 Hours Ago | 03:07

>Shares of Luluemon have cratered as quickly as its sales momentum.

>The Canadian retailer's stock tumbled more than 20 percent Thursday, hours after the athletic wear maker warned its fiscal first quarter has gotten off to a slow start amid a sea of drab clothes.

>Specifically, weak store traffic and fewer online purchases are setting the chain up for its first quarterly comparable sales decline since the recession.

>The news was an abrupt pivot from its fourth-quarter performance, when both sales and earnings posted double-digit gains. At least four analysts Thursday downgraded the company's shares, citing concerns about its about-face.

>Lululemon's warning added to concerns about a slowdown in the athletic apparel market, which has also been seen in recent results at Under Armour and Nike.

""lululemon athletica inc. should show some of the best growth in our coverage in 2017, but with a balanced risk/reward profile, 26.1x 2017 P/E, and a more competitive and maturing market, we move to Sector Weight. We project 13% revenue growth in 2017 as the Company continues to benefit from improvements to product (fabric and design innovation) as well as modest store growth. EBIT margin expansion (+287 bps in 3Q16) should continue, albeit at a more measured pace. The market cap of Under Armour and LULU has largely converged for the first time since December 2014 and we think that the LT addressable market and margin expansion opportunity of Under Armour is more significant.""

4pg54b_LULU,LULU,Lululemon apparently has a Ghost Board Member: Rhoda Pitcher. The story behind it is insane.,"Chip Wilson has been vocally complaining about the board of Lululemon. So Anders Keitz at The Street thought she'd ask the board members about their side of the story. What has happened since is pretty epic: she found out that one board member at the very least is really really difficult to find and Lululemon really doesn't wanna talk about this. 

It all started with her story [Lululemon's Ghost Board Member: Who Is Rhoda Pitcher?](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/06/18/2016/lululemons-ghost-board-member-who-rhoda-pitcher) She followed up with [Lululemon Has a Rhoda Pitcher Problem](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/06/21/2016/lululemon-has-rhoda-pitcher-problem) where we learned the company really doesn't believe in transparency all that much. Now we got [Lululemon Director Rhoda Pitcher Is 'Valued' -- but Still a Mystery](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/06/22/2016/lululemon-director-rhoda-pitcher-valued-still-mystery) ... a week and still bupkus from the company. 

I don't know about you guys but I'm getting my popcorn. However this turns out, be it a terrible, slow response that clears it all up or outright fraud, this will be one for the books. And if you are still in that company ... brass balls, ladies and gents. Brass balls. ",2016-06-23,276,69
