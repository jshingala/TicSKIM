# Intuitive Machines’ Moon Lander Flops Again

**Houston, we have a tipping problem.**

Intuitive Machines’ latest lunar mission ended in disappointment after its Athena lander touched down on its side instead of standing upright. The company confirmed that the lander came to rest about 250 meters from its target site near the moon’s south pole, cutting the mission short due to poor solar panel alignment and freezing temperatures. The market reaction was swift—shares of Intuitive Machines plunged 22% on Friday and are down more than 50% this year.

**Another rough landing**  
  
This isn’t Intuitive’s first moon mishap. Its Odysseus lander famously tipped over during its 2024 mission due to a malfunctioning laser used for navigation. The company claimed to have fixed the issue, but Athena’s navigation system delivered ""noisy"" data just before landing. CEO Steve Altemus suggested vibrations or temperature changes could have interfered with the system. “There was some event in space that caused that connection to get a little squirrelly on us,” he said.

**NASA’s private space bet isn’t paying off (yet)**  
  
Both Athena and Odysseus were part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, designed to boost private sector involvement in moon missions. Firefly Aerospace, another NASA-backed company, recently pulled off a clean lunar landing, raising the pressure on Intuitive Machines to deliver. NASA officials downplayed the failure, with one saying, “Landing on the moon is extremely hard.” Still, back-to-back issues aren’t exactly building confidence.

  
Athena’s mission included two rovers—one designed to hop across the surface—and Nokia’s first lunar cellular network. Neither rover has been able to communicate with the lander, leaving Nokia’s moon network in limbo. Meanwhile, Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander, which touched down March 2, is operating as planned.

**Investors losing patience:** Wall Street is running out of goodwill. Intuitive Machines' stock soared after Odysseus’s initial “successful” landing last year, but it’s been sliding since. Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan called the latest selloff an overreaction, noting Intuitive’s strong backlog and NASA contracts. Still, investors seem less interested in promises and more interested in actual results.

# White House Hosts First Cryptocurrency Summit

**Crypto just got a major White House upgrade.**

President Trump is going all in on crypto. On Friday, he endorsed legislation to regulate stablecoins and signed an executive order creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be stocked with Bitcoin seized from criminal cases, giving the government a tidy stash worth about $17.5 billion. Trump told crypto execs at a White House meeting that the US plans to use stablecoins to “keep the dollar dominant” and support the broader digital asset market.

**Bitcoin joins the big leagues**  
  
The reserve makes Bitcoin an official national asset—similar to gold—but with more volatility. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government will hold Bitcoin long-term, while a separate stockpile of other tokens will be managed for more strategic flexibility. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor were at the meeting, where Armstrong called the move a “game-changer for US leadership in crypto.”

**Stablecoins get a boost:** Trump also threw his support behind a bill from Senator Bill Hagerty aimed at regulating stablecoins—cryptos pegged to the dollar that power most crypto trades. The bill could fast-track adoption by giving institutional investors the regulatory green light they’ve been waiting for. Armstrong, whose company helped raise $250 million for pro-crypto candidates in 2024, said the legislation could “unlock massive growth” in the market.

**Markets take note:** Bitcoin dipped about 3% after the news, but Coinbase stock rose 1.5% and MicroStrategy climbed 5.6%. Saylor called the reserve “a major milestone” for Bitcoin, and some analysts expect it could open the door for Bitcoin-backed Treasury bonds. Whether it works or not, the White House just put crypto near the heart of America’s financial future.

# Fed’s Powell Says No Need to Hurry to Consider Rate Moves

**The Fed’s not ready to hit the big red cut button—yet.**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear on Friday that the central bank isn’t rushing to cut rates, even as Trump’s trade policies throw the economic outlook into question. Speaking at the University of Chicago’s Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said the economy is in a “good place” and that the Fed is “well positioned to wait for greater clarity” before making any moves. That’s despite rising inflation pressures and a labor market showing signs of strain.

**Uncertainty? What Uncertainty?**  
  
Powell acknowledged that Trump’s aggressive trade policies—especially the new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada—are creating economic uncertainty. But he downplayed the need for immediate action. February’s jobs report showed a modest 151,000 gain in payrolls and a small uptick in unemployment to 4.1%, but Powell described the labor market as “solid” and not a source of inflationary pressure. In other words, the Fed isn’t feeling the heat—yet.  
  
While Powell admitted that the path to 2% inflation remains “bumpy,” he said there’s still progress in housing and services costs. He also noted that consumer inflation expectations have crept up recently, but long-term measures remain stable. That’s key for the Fed—if expectations stay anchored, Powell is unlikely to adjust policy unless inflation heats up further.

**Trade Tariffs Cloud the Outlook**  
  
Trump’s tariffs are putting upward pressure on prices, but Powell suggested the Fed could “look through” temporary trade-related inflation spikes. However, if tariffs lead to rolling price increases or start fueling inflation expectations, the Fed may need to step in. Powell’s message: It’s complicated—but not yet dire.

**Wait and See Mode:** Markets are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June, but Powell isn’t giving in to the pressure. He’s signaling that the Fed is willing to hold steady until the full impact of Trump’s trade policies becomes clearer. For now, Powell’s taking the long view—and hoping the market has the patience to do the same.

# Next Week

After a whirlwind week, Wall Street could use a breather — but next week isn’t exactly shaping up to be a quiet one. While Monday looks light on action, things ramp up fast with the JOLTS report and the NFIB small business optimism index on Tuesday. Wednesday’s CPI report will set the tone for inflation chatter, followed by PPI and jobless claims on Thursday. Consumer sentiment wraps up the week on Friday, offering a glimpse into how confident Americans are feeling about the economy.

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect fireworks from the corporate side.

# White House Hosts First Cryptocurrency Summit

**Crypto just got a major White House upgrade.**

President Trump is going all in on crypto. On Friday, he endorsed legislation to regulate stablecoins and signed an executive order creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be stocked with Bitcoin seized from criminal cases, giving the government a tidy stash worth about $17.5 billion. Trump told crypto execs at a White House meeting that the US plans to use stablecoins to “keep the dollar dominant” and support the broader digital asset market.

**Bitcoin joins the big leagues**  
  
The reserve makes Bitcoin an official national asset—similar to gold—but with more volatility. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government will hold Bitcoin long-term, while a separate stockpile of other tokens will be managed for more strategic flexibility. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor were at the meeting, where Armstrong called the move a “game-changer for US leadership in crypto.”

**Stablecoins get a boost:** Trump also threw his support behind a bill from Senator Bill Hagerty aimed at regulating stablecoins—cryptos pegged to the dollar that power most crypto trades. The bill could fast-track adoption by giving institutional investors the regulatory green light they’ve been waiting for. Armstrong, whose company helped raise $250 million for pro-crypto candidates in 2024, said the legislation could “unlock massive growth” in the market.

**Markets take note:** Bitcoin dipped about 3% after the news, but Coinbase stock rose 1.5% and MicroStrategy climbed 5.6%. Saylor called the reserve “a major milestone” for Bitcoin, and some analysts expect it could open the door for Bitcoin-backed Treasury bonds. Whether it works or not, the White House just put crypto near the heart of America’s financial future.

# Fed’s Powell Says No Need to Hurry to Consider Rate Moves

**The Fed’s not ready to hit the big red cut button—yet.**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear on Friday that the central bank isn’t rushing to cut rates, even as Trump’s trade policies throw the economic outlook into question. Speaking at the University of Chicago’s Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said the economy is in a “good place” and that the Fed is “well positioned to wait for greater clarity” before making any moves. That’s despite rising inflation pressures and a labor market showing signs of strain.

**Uncertainty? What Uncertainty?**  
  
Powell acknowledged that Trump’s aggressive trade policies—especially the new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada—are creating economic uncertainty. But he downplayed the need for immediate action. February’s jobs report showed a modest 151,000 gain in payrolls and a small uptick in unemployment to 4.1%, but Powell described the labor market as “solid” and not a source of inflationary pressure. In other words, the Fed isn’t feeling the heat—yet.  
  
While Powell admitted that the path to 2% inflation remains “bumpy,” he said there’s still progress in housing and services costs. He also noted that consumer inflation expectations have crept up recently, but long-term measures remain stable. That’s key for the Fed—if expectations stay anchored, Powell is unlikely to adjust policy unless inflation heats up further.

**Trade Tariffs Cloud the Outlook**  
  
Trump’s tariffs are putting upward pressure on prices, but Powell suggested the Fed could “look through” temporary trade-related inflation spikes. However, if tariffs lead to rolling price increases or start fueling inflation expectations, the Fed may need to step in. Powell’s message: It’s complicated—but not yet dire.

**Wait and See Mode:** Markets are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June, but Powell isn’t giving in to the pressure. He’s signaling that the Fed is willing to hold steady until the full impact of Trump’s trade policies becomes clearer. For now, Powell’s taking the long view—and hoping the market has the patience to do the same.

# Intuitive Machines’ Moon Lander Flops Again

**Houston, we have a tipping problem.**

Intuitive Machines’ latest lunar mission ended in disappointment after its Athena lander touched down on its side instead of standing upright. The company confirmed that the lander came to rest about 250 meters from its target site near the moon’s south pole, cutting the mission short due to poor solar panel alignment and freezing temperatures. The market reaction was swift—shares of Intuitive Machines plunged 22% on Friday and are down more than 50% this year.

**Another rough landing**  
  
This isn’t Intuitive’s first moon mishap. Its Odysseus lander famously tipped over during its 2024 mission due to a malfunctioning laser used for navigation. The company claimed to have fixed the issue, but Athena’s navigation system delivered ""noisy"" data just before landing. CEO Steve Altemus suggested vibrations or temperature changes could have interfered with the system. “There was some event in space that caused that connection to get a little squirrelly on us,” he said.

**NASA’s private space bet isn’t paying off (yet)**  
  
Both Athena and Odysseus were part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, designed to boost private sector involvement in moon missions. Firefly Aerospace, another NASA-backed company, recently pulled off a clean lunar landing, raising the pressure on Intuitive Machines to deliver. NASA officials downplayed the failure, with one saying, “Landing on the moon is extremely hard.” Still, back-to-back issues aren’t exactly building confidence.

  
Athena’s mission included two rovers—one designed to hop across the surface—and Nokia’s first lunar cellular network. Neither rover has been able to communicate with the lander, leaving Nokia’s moon network in limbo. Meanwhile, Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander, which touched down March 2, is operating as planned.

# Intuitive Machines’ Moon Lander Flops Again

**Houston, we have a tipping problem.**

Intuitive Machines’ latest lunar mission ended in disappointment after its Athena lander touched down on its side instead of standing upright. The company confirmed that the lander came to rest about 250 meters from its target site near the moon’s south pole, cutting the mission short due to poor solar panel alignment and freezing temperatures. The market reaction was swift—shares of Intuitive Machines plunged 22% on Friday and are down more than 50% this year.

**Another rough landing**  
  
This isn’t Intuitive’s first moon mishap. Its Odysseus lander famously tipped over during its 2024 mission due to a malfunctioning laser used for navigation. The company claimed to have fixed the issue, but Athena’s navigation system delivered ""noisy"" data just before landing. CEO Steve Altemus suggested vibrations or temperature changes could have interfered with the system. “There was some event in space that caused that connection to get a little squirrelly on us,” he said.

**NASA’s private space bet isn’t paying off (yet)**  
  
Both Athena and Odysseus were part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, designed to boost private sector involvement in moon missions. Firefly Aerospace, another NASA-backed company, recently pulled off a clean lunar landing, raising the pressure on Intuitive Machines to deliver. NASA officials downplayed the failure, with one saying, “Landing on the moon is extremely hard.” Still, back-to-back issues aren’t exactly building confidence.

  
Athena’s mission included two rovers—one designed to hop across the surface—and Nokia’s first lunar cellular network. Neither rover has been able to communicate with the lander, leaving Nokia’s moon network in limbo. Meanwhile, Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander, which touched down March 2, is operating as planned.

**Investors losing patience:** Wall Street is running out of goodwill. Intuitive Machines' stock soared after Odysseus’s initial “successful” landing last year, but it’s been sliding since. Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan called the latest selloff an overreaction, noting Intuitive’s strong backlog and NASA contracts. Still, investors seem less interested in promises and more interested in actual results.

# White House Hosts First Cryptocurrency Summit

**Crypto just got a major White House upgrade.**

President Trump is going all in on crypto. On Friday, he endorsed legislation to regulate stablecoins and signed an executive order creating a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be stocked with Bitcoin seized from criminal cases, giving the government a tidy stash worth about $17.5 billion. Trump told crypto execs at a White House meeting that the US plans to use stablecoins to “keep the dollar dominant” and support the broader digital asset market.

**Bitcoin joins the big leagues**  
  
The reserve makes Bitcoin an official national asset—similar to gold—but with more volatility. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government will hold Bitcoin long-term, while a separate stockpile of other tokens will be managed for more strategic flexibility. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor were at the meeting, where Armstrong called the move a “game-changer for US leadership in crypto.”

**Stablecoins get a boost:** Trump also threw his support behind a bill from Senator Bill Hagerty aimed at regulating stablecoins—cryptos pegged to the dollar that power most crypto trades. The bill could fast-track adoption by giving institutional investors the regulatory green light they’ve been waiting for. Armstrong, whose company helped raise $250 million for pro-crypto candidates in 2024, said the legislation could “unlock massive growth” in the market.

**Markets take note:** Bitcoin dipped about 3% after the news, but Coinbase stock rose 1.5% and MicroStrategy climbed 5.6%. Saylor called the reserve “a major milestone” for Bitcoin, and some analysts expect it could open the door for Bitcoin-backed Treasury bonds. Whether it works or not, the White House just put crypto near the heart of America’s financial future.

# Fed’s Powell Says No Need to Hurry to Consider Rate Moves

**The Fed’s not ready to hit the big red cut button—yet.**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear on Friday that the central bank isn’t rushing to cut rates, even as Trump’s trade policies throw the economic outlook into question. Speaking at the University of Chicago’s Monetary Policy Forum, Powell said the economy is in a “good place” and that the Fed is “well positioned to wait for greater clarity” before making any moves. That’s despite rising inflation pressures and a labor market showing signs of strain.

**Uncertainty? What Uncertainty?**  
  
Powell acknowledged that Trump’s aggressive trade policies—especially the new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada—are creating economic uncertainty. But he downplayed the need for immediate action. February’s jobs report showed a modest 151,000 gain in payrolls and a small uptick in unemployment to 4.1%, but Powell described the labor market as “solid” and not a source of inflationary pressure. In other words, the Fed isn’t feeling the heat—yet.  
  
While Powell admitted that the path to 2% inflation remains “bumpy,” he said there’s still progress in housing and services costs. He also noted that consumer inflation expectations have crept up recently, but long-term measures remain stable. That’s key for the Fed—if expectations stay anchored, Powell is unlikely to adjust policy unless inflation heats up further.

**Trade Tariffs Cloud the Outlook**  
  
Trump’s tariffs are putting upward pressure on prices, but Powell suggested the Fed could “look through” temporary trade-related inflation spikes. However, if tariffs lead to rolling price increases or start fueling inflation expectations, the Fed may need to step in. Powell’s message: It’s complicated—but not yet dire.

**Wait and See Mode:** Markets are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June, but Powell isn’t giving in to the pressure. He’s signaling that the Fed is willing to hold steady until the full impact of Trump’s trade policies becomes clearer. For now, Powell’s taking the long view—and hoping the market has the patience to do the same.

Now I realize it’s in their best interest to paint it as such, but on its face, it seems to be more of a success than failure. The reason it didn’t land where it was supposed to is because surface conditions were unfavorable (craters, large boulders, etc) and autonomously shifted trajectory, which in itself is a huge technological leap from last years mission capabilities. Bottom line, the nature of this sector is trial and error. How many space x rockets exploded before they got it right. For these reasons I believe the market reaction is blown out of proportion.

I posted DD a few weeks back about buying the dip on this stock. Back then it was 22 ish and I predicted it would have some potential dips before going higher. Well those dips happened and I hope you scooped up some longs or shares when it was in the 17s and 18s. If you didn’t, then guess what, you’re not too late yet because it closed last Friday in the 19s and ready to rip over the next two month back into the 20s and through the 30s.

Why?

Because it’s launch season again. Last year they landed on the moon and in the two week run up to the landing, it ripped as news coverage started on the launch, getting your every day Joe Schmo talking about it. Well you’re on WSB, so you might as well jump on it before the rest of the country finds out that we’re about to land on the moon again.

Launch window opens the 26th. That means the run up is about to start. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it open up tomorrow already in the 20s, but don’t fear: any entrance in the 20s is a good entrance.

Last year the stock crashed a few days after launch. Why? It wasn’t a pump and dump. It’s cause the lander tipped over after landing. Is it going to tip over again? Highly unlikely. They spent the last year tripling and quadrupling up on their engineering to make sure that this time it’ll nail its position as the de facto lunar landing system of any US moon missions for the next few decades.

I wouldn’t sell before launch. I wouldn’t sell after landing either. There might be some profit taking dips, but the stock is just going to keep going up as their successes materialize.

Even AFTER it lands and literally moons, you’ve got earnings happening in late march a few weeks later, where they’ll break down their successes to the press and announce their plans moving forward as space missions expand. Expect that earnings report to be massive as well and at the very least, hold your plays for the run up to that earnings before making your decision to exit right before earnings or hold for another hit.

You want a short term play? This is it.

You want a long term play? This is it.

Scared about tariffs and economic conditions like inflation and rate cuts? LUNR is its own thing. NASAs doing this no matter what happens to the economy because the new space race is here. Go google articles about China’s recent moon efforts.

I’m not saying that this is your last chance to get on. But this is your last chance at getting on before it becomes way more expensive. Get your ticket stamped and hold on for the ride for the next 8 weeks.

2. recent news & catalysts 

NASA contract award: in late 2024, Intuitive Machines secured a NASA contract valued at up to $4.82 billion to provide communication and navigation services for missions extending from earth to beyond the moon. this positions the company as a key player in lunar data transmission.

upcoming IM-2 mission: scheduled for february 26th @7pm est, the IM-2 mission aims to deploy a drill, probe, and rover on the lunar surface. think “drill, baby, drill”! except for water. this follows the successful landing of the Odysseus lander, which was the company's first commercial moon landing.

partnerships: IM is collaborating with Nokia to deploy the first cellular network on the moon during the IM-2 mission. thisll cement LUNRs technological capabilities and market position.

3. financials & valuation

revenue growth: in Q3 2024, the company reported revenues of $73.07 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $45 million.

free cash flow: they have just issued their warrants at the beginning of this month which basically means they’re flush with cash. this will be reported in their next earnings on march 20th.

* Intuitive Machines of Houston will receive two task order awards on its contract for Subcategory 1.2 GEO to Cislunar Direct to Earth (DTE) Services and Subcategory 1.3 xCislunar DTE Services to support NASA’s Lunar Exploration Ground Segment, providing additional capacity to alleviate demand on the Deep Space Network and to meet the mission requirements for unique, highly elliptical orbits. The company also previously [received](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-lunar-relay-contractor-for-near-space-network-services/) a task order award for Subcategory 2.2 GEO to Cislunar Relay Services.
* Kongsberg Satellite Services of Tromsø, Norway, will receive two task order awards on its contract for Subcategory 1.1 Earth Proximity DTE and Subcategory 1.2 to support science missions in low Earth orbit and NASA’s Lunar Exploration Ground Segment, providing additional capacity to alleviate demand on the Deep Space Network.
* SSC Space U.S. Inc. of Horsham, Pennsylvania, will receive two task order awards on its contract for Subcategories 1.1 and 1.3 to support science missions in low Earth orbit and to meet the mission requirements for unique, highly elliptical orbits.
* Viasat, Inc. of Duluth, Georgia, will be awarded a task order on its contract for Subcategory 1.1 to support science missions in low Earth orbit.

The Near Space Network’s direct-to-Earth capability supports many of NASA’s missions ranging from climate studies on Earth to research on celestial objects. It also will play a role in NASA’s [Artemis campaign](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/), which calls for long-term exploration of the Moon.

NASA’s goal is to provide users with communication and navigation services that are secure, reliable, and affordable, so that all NASA users receive the services required by their mission within their latency, accuracy, and availability requirements.

These awards demonstrate NASA’s ongoing commitment to fostering strong partnerships with the commercial space sector, which plays an essential role in delivering the communications infrastructure critical to the agency’s science and exploration missions.

As part of the agency’s SCaN (Space Communications and Navigation) Program, teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, will carry out the work of the Near Space Network. The Near Space Network provides missions out to 1.2 million miles (2 million kilometers) with communications and navigation services, enabling spacecraft to exchange critical data with mission operators on Earth. Using space relays in geosynchronous orbit and a global system of government and commercial direct-to-Earth antennas on Earth, the network brings down terabytes of data each day.

I'm typically a very risk averse investor. I made one risky play in 2021, lost 50% of my principal, and swore off short swing investing entirely. Since then, I have parked most of my money in ETFs and a few long-play individual stocks.

With the recent election, a few of my long plays paid off to the tune of 10k and I got greedy and moved back to the HOOD. I made an additional 15% at first, but then the FOMO hit and I tried to chase TSLA and LUNR back to back, losing 25% of my gains in the process. This made me go full paperhands and liquidate.

I come to you degenerates to ask a simple question: how do you cope with this sort of loss? Luckily, I'm not forced to move to the local BK dumpster due to this move, but it just feels so bad. I went from pay for my holidays to losing two months of rent in a few swipes.

1fzvgfc_LUNR,LUNR,All in on LUNR,"I've been trading Intuitive Machines since mid 2023 and after the IM1 pullback consolidated my whole portfolio into Jan LUNR call options. The price is down today after spiking to $9 post NSN contract announcement. I look for a culmination of factors - not the least of which is a solid, cohesive, and inspired core team - when making such a bet, and I am supremely confident this stock will hit at least $12 by end of year with the potential, of course, to run much higher. This is how I anticipate it playing out.

The recent 4.8B NSN contract win is mind blowing. The market, in my view, has not yet come to terms with the implications of this contract as we see the price today pulling back to the low 7s. As we make our way to Nov earnings we should expect a gradual increase and a solid earnings beat, which will propel the stock higher leading up to the second moon landing mission (IM2) currently on track for early 2025. Exact date has yet to be announced. IM1 ralled the stock to $13 before it came back to earth. IM2 may not have the same hype, but the company is in a radically different position than it was a year prior.

Buying this stock today is a steal and if I had more to invest I'd pull the trigger without hesitation. NFA, DYOR, etc.

PS. I have RKLB as a close second in terms of value. I'd be in RKLB too if I didn't put everything in LUNR. I may diversify into RKLB at some point in Q1. Once these calls are realized I'll likely just buy and hold the stock long term.

My initial assumption was that some insiders got the news that LUNR was given the NSNS contract from NASA and artificially lowered the price of the stock so they could buy at a low and then sell when the news was released. However, my assumptions were false and the spike today was due to a collaboration with Imagine Dragons and Bethesda.

""Imagine Dragons will also team up with Bethesda Games Studio, for a live debut of their track, “Children of the Sky (A Starfield Song).” Additionally, the track “will be transmitted back to Earth from the surface of the Moon as part of Lonestar’s Freedom Mission flying with Intuitive Machines to the South Lunar Pole in early 2025,” per a release""

This with NSNS contract news that can drop any day now will most likely increase LUNR stock to unseen heights. In addition, I think space stocks are going to be the new A.I. stock in the coming years because both political candidates support space travel and expansion. Furthermore, when the Artemis II goes off it will generate public awareness (Manned flyby missions) which could mean more investments into space.  Artemis II is expected to launch in September 2025 so a lot of time to start investing. Lastly, Artemis III will launch in September 2026 and it will be the first crewed landing since Apollo 17. Apollo 11 had 650 million viewers so imagine how much viewership Artemis III will bring especially when more people will have access to watch it and the fact we have not stepped on the moon like 50 years.

Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results

August of 2023 LUNR became a ""penny stock"" closing under the cost of $5.00/share and stuck around there until the hype of the first launch/landing in Feb 6 months ago. The Hype died down, it dipped back into penny stock territory a couple times but usually maintained a share price over $5.00 until March earnings. Earning were lower than expected, and LUNR was back to penny stock status.

Earnings this month had a very positive outlook on future revenue as we're all aware. The rumor of the NSNS Contract last Tuesday brought the stock back and out of penny stock territory, and back to the price range we were seeing in early May, prior to May earnings.

LUNR does appear to be favored to win the NSNS contract, based on the effect the rumor had on the stock price, confirmation of this contract would likely push us over the $6-$7 range. With the second contract LUNR is in contention for likely being awarded next week, its looking more than probable that LUNR will be firmly planted outside ""penny stock"" pricing.",2024-08-28,42,48

Bunch of big nasa heads formed the company seeing how space is going to be privatized.

Their stock tanked after their first lander tipped over due to them forgetting to remove a landing laser safety. That is an error, but you can bet it will never happen again. They were also first to land on the moon in decades. China pressure will increase lunar budget within gov.

Here is the ceo:
Mr. Altemus is co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Intuitive Machines. Before founding Intuitive Machines in December 2012, Mr. Altemus was appointed to serve as the Deputy Director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, a position he held until June 2013. Formerly Director of Engineering from July 2006 to December 2012, Mr. Altemus served as the leader and steward of Johnson Space Center’s engineering capabilities in support of NASA’s human spaceflight programs, projects, and technology activities. Mr. Altemus is also a director of Intuitive Aviation, a subsidiary of Intuitive Machines. Mr. Altemus received a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, where he now serves as a member of the Engineering Advisory Board, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from the University of Central Florida. He joined NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and the Space Shuttle Program in 1989, where he held progressively more responsible positions working in Space Shuttle operations, launch, and landing activities. He served as the Columbia Reconstruction Director after the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003. In January 2005, he joined Johnson Space Center, serving as the Deputy Director of Engineering, and was subsequently selected as Director in July 2006. Mr. Altemus is an award-winning engineer and leader. He has been presented with the Federal Engineer of the Year award from the National Society of Professional Engineers, Distinguished Alumni Award from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and Johnson Space Center’s Engineering Legacy Award.


Q: (from u/LittleWhite0nRice)
You seem really knowledgeable on this industry. I've done a lot of DD on them and they seem great. But my question is: what's their future outlook for expansion? It seems like most space exploration companies are private and won't use LUNR so their consumer is NASA which can be defunded easily. Why keep spending money going to the moon? 

A:
Lander missions and rover are the short term. Lunar satellites are the long term. Providing *the* communications network for lunar truckstop to Mars is a pretty sci fi concept but thats how they'd go from 1-off missions and a market cap of $500M to something in the double digit $B. This plan is already in action- ""The [IM3] mission is also scheduled to carry a data relay satellite, Khon2, which it will deploy to travel to the L2 Earth-Moon libration point. The mission can also carry approximately 1000 kg of secondary payloads to lunar transfer orbit."" This is currently scheduled for Oct 25.

Positions- Shares, 2, 5, and 10 dollar calls spread between Jan '24 into 2025.

TLDR: LUNR is legit. WSB effect could create a squeeze, but I am in long term. I don't think there is a need to FOMO and get it right now, if there is a spike from WSB, you can wait for goldfish brains here to lose focus and for it to come down a bit and get in October or November.",2024-08-20,714,286

1bd9wsh_LUNR,LUNR,Intuitive Machines (LUNR) - Space exploration company undergoing a major financial recovery,"**Intuitive Machines (LUNR)** designs, manufactures, and operates space products and services in the US. Its space systems and space infrastructure enable scientific and human exploration and utilization of lunar resources to support sustainable human presence on the moon. The company offers µNova, a lunar rocket-fueled drone, lunar surface rover services, fixed lunar surface services, rideshare delivery services, lunar access services, lunar orbit delivery services, and lunar data network services, as well as content sales and marketing. It also offers aerospace engineering services to **NASA** and the aerospace industry.  


LUNR is currently holding over the $5 a share level ($11 last month), having spiked above $40 a share upon its listing in February 2023.  


What I quickly noticed during my initial research is that they blew past Q2 and Q3 earnings estimates, as shown below (EPS in dollars). This equated to net income of $30mn and $34mn, respectively.

https://preview.redd.it/21y60o8b4znc1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=c65e5aa83663a9e809e65c33595ebb9d9358dfb0

What was the biggest red flag to me (but please read to the end) is that its total liabilities in Q3 2023 stand at $422mn, compared to total assets of $103mn. They are very debt heavy. BUT in the space of 6 months from May - September 2023, they reduced total liabilities from $957mn to $422mn.   


If the firm can keep positive cashflow, then at this rate they could have a healthy balance sheet within the year. Total cash levels currently sit at $41mn.

https://preview.redd.it/z1al6wrn4znc1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=d966669341bffa58215c9ac35e24716c4506e1e3

LUNR report their Q4 2023 results on **21 March 2024**. Another big earnings beat and a continued reduction in total liabilities will provide a huge green light to investors. The federal reserve interest rate cuts will also spur further debt reductions.  
Short selling activity is currently low according to S&P Global.

Intuitive Machines symbol LUNR has launched Nova-C to deliver payloads to the moon. This will be the first moon landing completed by america in over 50 years and as far as I know, the first moon landing completed by a private company. The Nova-C is only a day away from being in the moon's orbit and about two days away from landing. The success in the landing will be a monumental moment for this company, but also incredibly pivotal. This will be revolutionary for the commercialization of space and the Nova-C is just the beginning. With goals of delivering payloads and eventually retrieving precious materials from space, this company clearly has a strong future. For more general information and more technical DD reference this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the\_value\_of\_lunr\_and\_why\_it\_could\_spike\_up\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1atnihy/the_value_of_lunr_and_why_it_could_spike_up_500/)

**Will it Fail?:** I was nervous to bet on the launch because we’ve seen countless failed launches, but how many failed landings have you seen? We haven't landed on the moon in awhile, but we have never failed an actual landing. Now, to be fair, we’ve had failed moon missions because of technical difficulties in the spacecraft that occurred BEFORE the actual landing. Such as [Apollo 13](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html#:~:text=The%20Apollo%2013%20malfunction%20was,it%20to%20lose%20oxygen%20rapidly.) or Intuitive Machines leading competitor, [Astrobotics, recent failure because of a fuel leak/Native American Curse](https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-launch-private-nasa-0987b31b201b78c3935f1bfbf9a7cade) (more on that later). When have we ever failed a landing on the ISS? Never. Now again, I am not talking about missions being aborted before attempting touch down, I am talking about the literal moment of landing, which at this point is really all that’s left for the Nova-C. We have never failed this. (If we have someone please send me a source, most of this information was gathered in about 30 minutes.)

Is there still a chance we fail the landing? Of course. Are the chances of failing lower than ever? Yes. Our technology for trajectory and directional control in space has been stable for a long time, breaking out of the atmosphere is the hard part, the landing is straightforward. Especially for this company! They SPECIALIZE in accurate landings. Bard said this, “Intuitive Machines: Uses Nova-C, a single-stage lander designed for precise lunar landings and delivering payloads. They leverage existing technologies and partner with other companies for specific needs.” They're landing tech is perfected beyond belief, just look at this [inspiring animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc).[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK5n6fcnyc)

On this current mission they are set to deliver [5 NASA payloads](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=IM-1-NOVA). That means, fucking NASA, trusts this company to handle their billion dollar instruments, instead of just delivering it themselves. Apparently it's cheaper for NASA to deliver this way, but either way that is a lot of trust. THIS company will be responsible for aLL commercial payloads going forward. They will have a monopoly on delivering custom contracted research equipment and other payloads to space. Here are all the payloads the Nova-C is carrying:

&#x200B;

[Current Update: Nova-C is expected to be in the moon’s orbit by the 21st. They plan on announcing the time of the landing tomorrow, the 20th. They are currently looking to land sometime in the afternoon on February 22nd and will be live streaming the event on their website.](https://preview.redd.it/xjwy342mmmjc1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efed552c58b4831c4756efec759ae2eda004954)

**“Astrobotic drummed up its own freight business, packing the 6-foot-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Peregrine lander. On board the lander: a chip of rock from Mount Everest, toy-size cars from Mexico and ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.**

**The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because of the human remains. saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a celestial body revered by Native Americans. Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future missions.”**

Nova-C clearly has god on their side, but do they also have anime? We’ll see…

18ljb67_LUNR,LUNR,LUNR - Literally Going to the Moon,"LUNR stock is Intuitive Machines. They have developed and built lunar landers for future supply missions to the lunar surface, a commercial lunar economy. Their first attempt at landing on the moon will be the IM-1 mission which blasts off on a Space X Falcon 9 rocket during a launch window that opens on January 12. If successful, it will be the FIRST private enterprise to land on the lunar surface and will also mark the FIRST time the USA has returned to the moon since the Apollo missions. The lander has arrived at Cape Canaveral and is awaiting it's launch window at Space X.



NASA just recently posted a video discussing the importance of private commercial supply missions to the moon found in the following video: [https://youtu.be/q3gePeT3yxg?si=oh4YRt93erO6hJAP](https://youtu.be/q3gePeT3yxg?si=oh4YRt93erO6hJAP)


They currently have over $1B in contracts with NASA, one as large as $719M, as part of the artemis program returning astronauts to the moon. NASA eyes Intutitive Machines as being a major catalyst in creating habitation on the moon as they will be primarily providing supply services (ie. ""trucking"" heavy equipment to the moon for future missions). The current market cap of the company at the time of writing this is about $260M (share price of $2.83). The current float of shares avaialble to the public is about 20M (\~$57M of the market cap), with a different class of shares held internally and with institutions making up the rest.


So how much is this company actually worth? I don't know, nobody knows. What's the lunar economy worth? How much do you think it could be worth? For myself, given the complexity and small players in the market, I have a few guesses and those being alot higher than what the stock is valued at now. The stock is beat up right now, but has been consolidating around it current level for a few months now. The last major slide was when they delayed their first mission, back in August


But what is my play when it comes to LUNR? I don't have a price target, it is purely a psychological play on the market. What I do have is a catalyst (the upcomming mission), the low float of shares avaialble to the public and the certain mania and FOMO that are to follow as the launch window approaches. This is an industry which is just beginning, an industry that excites people and industry that could have growth beyond anyones dreams. The mania will happen, the FOMO will happen and the launch is finally happening. The pump is real. The dump...well that could be very real as well if the mission is failure...but enter now and sell on the way up...hope for the best...but if you manage your trade you will make your profit.


TLDR; LUNR is blasting off on a Space X rocket in mid January and is literally going to the moon! Mania and FOMO on a low float stock to pick up steam as the launch window approaches.",2023-12-18,11,22
