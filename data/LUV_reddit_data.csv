1ja1j0d_UAL,UAL,No $LUV here,"Wanted to get some thoughts on Southwest’s new “no free bags” policy. On paper, I get that it could boost revenue, but I don’t see how $LUV can compete now that they’re essentially just another airline. Their stock is already trading at a 40 P/E ratio—the highest in the airline industry—and I’m struggling to justify that valuation.

For context, I fly about 35 times a year for work and took 20+ Southwest flights last year. In many cases, their fares are as expensive—if not more expensive—than Delta or American, yet both of those airlines offer a significantly better experience. Southwest also has inconvenient flight times for business travelers, with many departures in the mid-morning, early afternoon, or late at night (8 PM or later).

Beyond that, they don’t offer lounge access—small detail, but another premium feature their competitors have that they don’t. And of course, we all remember the massive tech failures that caused travel disruptions last year. I just don’t see how they make the jump to a premium airline identity like United, American, or Delta - which is who they will be competing with. More likely, they evolve into something of a hybrid between Spirit and their former self—a budget airline with easy to understand rules (no assigned seats), a fun brand (wanna get away), a few perks and clear and transparent fares but nothing truly differentiating anymore.

Given all this, I’m seriously considering shorting $LUV, and targeting a future $12-18 per share price within the next 12 months. Curious to hear what others think.

# Bags Will No Longer Fly Free on Southwest Airlines

Southwest just kissed its most iconic perk goodbye. After more than 50 years of letting customers check two bags for free, the airline announced Tuesday that it will start charging baggage fees on tickets purchased after May 28. Investors loved it—Southwest stock soared 8.34%—but customers are already threatening to pack their bags and head elsewhere.

**No More Free Ride**  
  
“Bags fly free” wasn’t just a policy—it was Southwest’s identity. CEO Bob Jordan even said last summer that free checked bags were the “number one reason” customers chose the airline. But after Elliott Management muscled its way onto Southwest’s board last fall, the focus has shifted from customer loyalty to boosting revenue. Passengers without top-tier loyalty status or business fares will soon have to cough up a fee for checked bags, putting Southwest in line with its rivals.

**Wall Street’s Loving It**  
  
The financial logic is simple: US airlines raked in over $5 billion in baggage fees last year, with most carriers charging around $35 a pop. That’s easy money, especially as Southwest looks to cut $1 billion in costs after recent layoffs, route reductions, and hiring freezes. Investors rewarded the move, sending shares soaring even as Delta tanked 7.25% after slashing its earnings outlook due to weakening demand.

**Customers? Not So Much**  
  
Flyers were quick to vent. One viral post on X called the change “the stupidest thing they could do to ruin the company.” Aviation analyst Bill McGee piled on, saying, “Southwest has the strongest customer loyalty in an industry with almost no loyalty. This could destroy that.” Even Delta’s president admitted the move is “a big opportunity” to poach Southwest’s once-loyal customer base.

**Strategic or Self-Destructive?** Jordan insists the math checks out, claiming that fresh customer behavior data justified the change. But Southwest now faces the risk of alienating the very customers who stuck with it through turbulence. Without free bags, Southwest looks a lot more like its competitors—and for many travelers, that might be reason enough to look elsewhere.

# Nissan Replaces CEO After Failed Honda Merger

Nissan is switching drivers after its failed merger with Honda left the company skidding. Ivan Espinosa, Nissan’s chief planning officer, will take over as CEO on April 1, replacing Makoto Uchida, the automaker announced Tuesday. Espinosa has his work cut out for him: Nissan’s stock is down over 40% since Uchida took over in 2019, and the company’s latest earnings report showed a 94% drop in net income.

**A Merger Gone Wrong**  
  
The Honda-Nissan tie-up was supposed to create a $60 billion automotive powerhouse to compete with Toyota and fend off rising Chinese rivals like BYD. But the deal fell apart in February when Honda pushed to make Nissan a subsidiary and shut down some factories. Uchida balked at losing Nissan’s autonomy, and the deal unraveled—leaving Nissan without a clear path forward. Uchida admitted that voices of doubt had been growing louder internally, and the company’s deteriorating financials ultimately made his position untenable.

**Espinosa Takes the Wheel**  
  
Espinosa, 46, has been with Nissan since 2003 and knows the company inside and out. As chief planning officer, he’s overseen future product strategy, but now he’ll need to focus on damage control. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs and slash production capacity by 20%, but analysts say it will take more than cost-cutting to fix the company’s competitive and financial problems. Espinosa hasn’t laid out specific plans yet, but securing a strategic partner—possibly Foxconn—is likely high on his list.

**Renault to the Rescue?** Renault, which holds a 36% stake in Nissan, welcomed Espinosa’s appointment. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said Nissan needs to “find the strength to get back on its feet,” signaling that Renault could deepen ties if Nissan can stabilize. Renault’s recent restructuring gives Nissan more independence, but also leaves it more vulnerable without a solid backup plan.

**No Margin for Error:** Nissan has fallen behind rivals in EVs and hybrids, and it’s losing market share in both the US and China. The company is expected to post an annual net loss of around ¥80 billion ($550 million). Espinosa’s product expertise gives Nissan a shot at a turnaround—but without a financial lifeline or a breakthrough product, Nissan could be headed for more trouble.

This is Nissan’s fourth CEO change in eight years. If Espinosa can’t steer the ship, Nissan could be looking at more than just a leadership shakeup—it could be looking at a takeover.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s spotlight is on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the last big inflation check before the Fed huddles up next week to talk rates. Economists are expecting February’s headline CPI to rise 0.3% from January, cooling the annual rate to 2.9% from 3.0%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is also projected to climb 0.3% monthly and 3.2% annually.

But those forecasts come with an asterisk. The looming threat of tariffs has pushed companies to front-load imports and bump up prices, which could throw a wrench in the inflation data. All eyes are on whether the Fed will stay the course or shift its game plan.

The financial logic is simple: US airlines raked in over $5 billion in baggage fees last year, with most carriers charging around $35 a pop. That’s easy money, especially as Southwest looks to cut $1 billion in costs after recent layoffs, route reductions, and hiring freezes. Investors rewarded the move, sending shares soaring even as Delta tanked 7.25% after slashing its earnings outlook due to weakening demand.

**Customers? Not So Much**  
  
Flyers were quick to vent. One viral post on X called the change “the stupidest thing they could do to ruin the company.” Aviation analyst Bill McGee piled on, saying, “Southwest has the strongest customer loyalty in an industry with almost no loyalty. This could destroy that.” Even Delta’s president admitted the move is “a big opportunity” to poach Southwest’s once-loyal customer base.

**Strategic or Self-Destructive?** Jordan insists the math checks out, claiming that fresh customer behavior data justified the change. But Southwest now faces the risk of alienating the very customers who stuck with it through turbulence. Without free bags, Southwest looks a lot more like its competitors—and for many travelers, that might be reason enough to look elsewhere.

# Nissan Replaces CEO After Failed Honda Merger

Nissan is switching drivers after its failed merger with Honda left the company skidding. Ivan Espinosa, Nissan’s chief planning officer, will take over as CEO on April 1, replacing Makoto Uchida, the automaker announced Tuesday. Espinosa has his work cut out for him: Nissan’s stock is down over 40% since Uchida took over in 2019, and the company’s latest earnings report showed a 94% drop in net income.

**A Merger Gone Wrong**  
  
The Honda-Nissan tie-up was supposed to create a $60 billion automotive powerhouse to compete with Toyota and fend off rising Chinese rivals like BYD. But the deal fell apart in February when Honda pushed to make Nissan a subsidiary and shut down some factories. Uchida balked at losing Nissan’s autonomy, and the deal unraveled—leaving Nissan without a clear path forward. Uchida admitted that voices of doubt had been growing louder internally, and the company’s deteriorating financials ultimately made his position untenable.

**Espinosa Takes the Wheel**  
  
Espinosa, 46, has been with Nissan since 2003 and knows the company inside and out. As chief planning officer, he’s overseen future product strategy, but now he’ll need to focus on damage control. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs and slash production capacity by 20%, but analysts say it will take more than cost-cutting to fix the company’s competitive and financial problems. Espinosa hasn’t laid out specific plans yet, but securing a strategic partner—possibly Foxconn—is likely high on his list.

**Renault to the Rescue?** Renault, which holds a 36% stake in Nissan, welcomed Espinosa’s appointment. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said Nissan needs to “find the strength to get back on its feet,” signaling that Renault could deepen ties if Nissan can stabilize. Renault’s recent restructuring gives Nissan more independence, but also leaves it more vulnerable without a solid backup plan.

**No Margin for Error:** Nissan has fallen behind rivals in EVs and hybrids, and it’s losing market share in both the US and China. The company is expected to post an annual net loss of around ¥80 billion ($550 million). Espinosa’s product expertise gives Nissan a shot at a turnaround—but without a financial lifeline or a breakthrough product, Nissan could be headed for more trouble.

This is Nissan’s fourth CEO change in eight years. If Espinosa can’t steer the ship, Nissan could be looking at more than just a leadership shakeup—it could be looking at a takeover.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s spotlight is on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the last big inflation check before the Fed huddles up next week to talk rates. Economists are expecting February’s headline CPI to rise 0.3% from January, cooling the annual rate to 2.9% from 3.0%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is also projected to climb 0.3% monthly and 3.2% annually.

But those forecasts come with an asterisk. The looming threat of tariffs has pushed companies to front-load imports and bump up prices, which could throw a wrench in the inflation data. All eyes are on whether the Fed will stay the course or shift its game plan.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Adobe** is trying to thread the needle in the AI race, giving away tools like Firefly for free to lure users now and (hopefully) cash in later. But while it’s building goodwill, free AI alternatives are already eating into Adobe’s bread-and-butter subscription businesses. That leaves Adobe stuck in the middle, and shareholders are feeling the squeeze. Without a clear path to monetize its AI strategy, investors are left wondering how long the company can keep walking this tightrope. ($ADBE)",2025-03-11,6,0

1ccpg0m_LUV,LUV,Southwest Airlines warns Boeing airplane delays will hit growth into 2025,"Southwest Airlines on Thursday posted a wider loss for the first quarter than the same period last year and warned that Boeing’s airplane delays will hamper its growth into 2025.

The airline expects to grow capacity 4% this year, down from a plan to expand 6%. For the second quarter, it forecast growth of 8% to 9% and said revenue would be down as much as 3.5%.

Shares of Southwest fell roughly 10% in premarket trading.

The airline said in an quarterly filing that it now expects to receive only 20 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, down from its previous forecast for 46 of them. The carrier will now delay retiring some of its older Boeing planes and is cutting costs, including by offering staff voluntary time-off. Southwest said it expects to end the year with 2,000 fewer employees than it had at the end of 2023.

and shut down operations at some airports, including in Syracuse, New York, Bellingham International Airport in Washington, Cozumel International Airport and Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental.

“Achieving our financial goals is an immediate imperative,” CEO Bob Jordan said in an earnings release. “The recent news from Boeing regarding further aircraft delivery delays presents significant challenges for both 2024 and 2025. We are reacting and replanning quickly to mitigate the operational and financial impacts while maintaining dependable and reliable flight schedules for our Customers.”

The Dallas-based carrier operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet and is acutely impacted by Boeing’s aircraft delays stemming from its safety and quality crises.

The carrier had previously warned that slower Boeing deliveries were hampering its growth.

Here’s how Southwest performed in the first quarter compared with Wall Street expectations, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:

Loss per share: 36 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 34 cents

Revenue: $6.33 billion vs. an expected $6.42 billion

Southwest lost $231 million, or 39 cents a share, in the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $159 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier when it was dealing with the aftermath of its holiday meltdown.

Adjusting for one-time items, including costs related to labor contracts and fuel, Southwest lost $218 million, or 36 cents a share.

Revenue rose almost 11% to $6.33 billion, slightly below analysts’ estimates as compiled by LSEG.

I don’t think it will be long before he turns to US producers and drives down fuel prices at least in the near term which would be well received for southwest. This would be even further supported by a mild winter which is the outlook. Second I think this holiday season will be big for domestic air travel.

nmiznm_LUV,LUV,"LUV, ETH, and FB Shifting Timeframes Analysis","I'm posting here for the first time (I think), and at least the first time in this manner. This is also my first time uploading images, so let's see if it works!

I am doing this to meditate on my philosophy since I have gotten away from it recently. I don't have a Youtube channel, and there's nothing to sell. This is for me more than anyone else, but if any of this resonates with anyone else, then great.

Since I started getting into technical analysis, it was clear to me that you have to trade what you see, and that if you only see a head and shoulders (or anything else) after the fact, then it's of no use to you. It also appeared like the MACD worked the most often of any indicator that I saw. It did not always work, but I was amazed at the extent to which it did work when it did so. This was enough for my newly impressionable mind to latch onto this. Why did it work sometimes and not others? What I noticed was that it seemed to work more often when the price action was very tight and smooth. A corollary of tight and smooth price action appeared to be that any price flag or leg would not run too long--if it did so, it would almost certainly show itself and become jagged or have some clear false starts on the chosen timeframe. This was important because if it ran too long, then it would outrun the MACD parameters.

An example of this is found by comparing the images for the 15-min and 5-min charts for LUV from today, 5.27.21. Looking at the 5-, you can see a MACD histo turn up from below 0 at around 11:30, but you would want no part of this--the price pattern just looks ugly. Then you can shift to the 15-, which compresses the price action and effectively gets rid of a lot of the noise. It's not a perfect picture, but it at least looks like there's a story there. That's another way to think of tightness--order within chaos, a narrative, a story. And as a result, price rises with MACD histo for good around 2:15, rising from 61.2 to end the day at 61.73. It still had to reset after a false rise at 1:00, but the drop after was not so detrimental that you would need to bail.

The next image is of ETH today. This wound up rising from 28.8 at 2:00 (after a reset bar at 1:15) to end the day at 29.39. I thought that this looked a little too steep with its initial descent, which can make me shy away from a formation.

Last is FB on the 10-min, which is quite a pretty picture. If you looked at this on the 15-, you would have had no warning and it would have popped without you. If followed on the 5-, the flag would have gone on much too long and left you wondering if this would ever happen. The 10- is the perfect middle ground.

This looks a lot like just looking at when resistance trendlines are broken through, and it can be very similar. But in that case a good question is why MACD is even necessary or useful. FB shows how MACD can be helpful here. It can serve as a reminder for when a flag or leg is or isn't tight enough. The 5-min chart offers a few opportunities to buy based on MACD histo turn and price response, highlighted. But the first opportunity presents a hardly-formed leg that would not offer much excitement. By the time you see the second and third, you see that the price action itself, at least as far as the leg down goes, has no story. Moreover, if the MACD needs one or two down bars to reset quickly, I'm okay with that, but after 1:15, this was not just resetting--it was declining. Once that happens, at the very least you have to shift to a higher timeframe to see if there is any greater semblance of a story. If you do shift to the 10-, then you see that the story is still setting up, with declining price and MACD histo, and because the MACD is leading in nature, you need to wait for a flatline if not an outright turn.

A few points:

\--Why MACD histo (22,33,11) instead of MACD (12,26,9)? I think the former imitates but simplifies the latter. There is less to examine. However, it can trick you by giving you a turn up when you're in the middle of a terrible decline. For that, I have a rule not to go against the MA(50) on the particular timeframe that I am using. This can imitate the location of the MACD line itself, where it's not a great idea to buy if the line has been below 0 for an extended period.

\--I got away from this because of FOMO and the need for quick and small gains so that I feel like I'm going to work, milking the cows, whatever metaphor you like. Getting 5%, 7%, -2%, 9%, -3% on SPY options in a day felt pretty good with the right money invested and the right stops used. But that led to me forcing things and no longer looking for tightness and instead just jumping on when specific EMAs of very low timeframes were going in one direction. In and out. But this can turn against you quickly. When that happens, you have to be ready to cut. But also, it's just not fun for me when I do that. 'The 1- and 3- EMA(11) are both trending up, so let's buy' isn't something that I ultimately believe in and isn't what got me excited in the first place.

\--On the FOMO aspect, I got away from this because so many times I would see AMZN break away on the lower timeframes for no clear reason, extending and keeping going, causing me to hop onto an EMA trend and see how long it lasts. First, maybe if I had looked at it on higher timeframes I would have seen a clear story and why it was breaking away; maybe not. But second, the goal is not to get every single move. The goal is to make those that you get good ones. You want ""if I buy it, then it will probably rise,"" not ""if it rises, then I probably bought it.""

\--Of course these can still fail, and you must still use sensible stops.

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO made $9.04 Billion in revenue.
* They spend more than $-14 Billion with a loss of $-3.0 Billion.
* Investors lost $-5.4 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $14.8 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 18.1% a year for the next 5 years. That means SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO will be worth $50.4, which represents a **-17.5%** downside from the current price.

Forgive the degenerate writing, I just like this stock and want others to know about it. 

**What is Southwest Airlines?** 

**Southwest Airlines Co.** is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier.  The airline was established on March 15, 1967, by Herb Kelleher as **Air Southwest** Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

Southwest operates a leisure-focused low-cost carrier, **which is well-positioned for a leisure-led post-pandemic recovery in aviation**.  Southwest has generally been able to achieve low-cost carrier unit expenses and passenger yields close to legacy carrier levels.  **Southwest’s focus on providing low fares could allow it to make inroads with business travel in the current recessionary environment.**

**Why get in now?**

1.  **CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion on Shares of Southwest Airlines Co.**

* ""We lift our target to $53 (from $48), 20x our 2022 EPS estimate (raised to $2.79 from $2.66; 2021 unchanged)."" 
* Q4 adjusted EPS of -$1.29 vs. $0.98 beat consensus by $0.39. 
* Revenue fell 65% Y/Y in Q4 as the pandemic continued to depress air travel demand. **Yet, despite the quarter’s major resurgence of Covid-19, which led to new travel restrictions and business closures, LUV’s revenue grew 12% vs. Q3.** Such strong sequential revenue growth in this harsh environment suggests that there is significant pent up air travel demand. We think this demand will start to be unleashed this Spring as vaccines become widely distributed, allowing LUV to soundly beat revenue and EPS estimates for 2021. 
* Additionally, despite the unprecedented demand weakness, **LUV has maintained a strong balance sheet with negative net debt throughout the pandemic.** 
* Manageable debt, strong customer loyalty, and efficient operations will lead LUV to be the first major airline to recover profitability, in our view, which we expect midway thru Q2. 

[ For the first quarter 2021, analysts estimate LUV will earn -$1.90 non-GAAP per share, a decrease of 1,168.00&#37; over the prior year first quarter non-GAAP results. ](https://preview.redd.it/nfs70jt76xf61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de9a23e3ff7d48c85c818d94c6272ec13ff2ab)

2.  Southwest has used the pandemic as an expansion opportunity, adding 14 new destinations since March 2020.   Overall, the 14 new destinations added or announced by Southwest since March 2020: 

* Chicago O’Hare (ORD)
* Houston Bush Intercontinental (IAH)
* Jackson, Mississippi (JAN)
* Savannah, Georgia (SAV)
* Miami and Sarasota in Florida
* Fresno (FAT), Palm Springs (PSP) and Santa Barbara (SBA) in California
* Colorado Springs (COS), Montrose/Telluride (MTJ), and Steamboat Springs (HDN) in Colorado
* Cozumel (CZM) in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

[$LUV recovery is going well as the pandemic persists.   Massive demands for travel coming in March... Summer of 2021 will be a record for air travel... Thanksgiving and Christmas will be off the charts... ](https://preview.redd.it/4k8twynv4xf61.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=574a353ca0e66a0ff9a841319fa0b29641e3e481)

3.  Passenger traffic is likely to be severely depressed until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed.

* Southwest no longer operates only Boeing 737 aircraft.  Unit expenses are likely to decrease, as the 737 MAX is recertified (as of November 18th, 2020).
   * LUV is the king of US domestic air travel and has the strongest balance. 115 million Americans will be fully vaccinated by Summer, another 100 million by end of Summer. These 215 million will be living life like 2019. The other 115 million by New Years. LUV will be back to 2019 peaks in 2022. **Buy now for the bargain pricing. It will be a bumpy flight for a while, but calm and smooth in 2022.** 
* Ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, show that the leisure market can serve consumers that are particularly cost-conscious.

krt2sd_LUV,LUV,Better buy? [BETZ vs. DKNG] [JETS vs. LUV] [MGM vs. CZR],"When it comes to ETF's vs Stocks which would be the better buy between these pairs. I own positions in all but would like to just choose one and increase my position in them. Right now I'm about 50/50 in each.

\[BETZ vs. DKNG\]

BETZ has DKNG and PENN but in small percentages (\~5%) so a big rise in DKNG would not show very well in the ETF but it is less volatile in the end. I so see DKNG being a leader in the field but the ETF has more diversity in the whole online gambling sector.

\[JETS vs. LUV\]

JETS has a large stake in LUV with around 10% which is nice and the second biggest being DAL at around 9%. Both really good companies so I can see JETS increasing nicely once things get back to normal. However there are many other airlines in there that aren't as good and may not be around if the pandemic continues. LUV is awesome with domestic travel and I believe that is what everyone will be doing once the pandemic ends but who knows. They also have a great balance sheet same with DAL.

\[MGM vs. CZR\]

MGM has its online sports booking (Betmgm) but also owns a ton of the Las Vegas strip. Growth potential is huge when things get back to normal and people flood to Las Vegas. I feel the same way about CZR but after they merged with El Dorado they've had a pretty good run but could definitely go higher. I'd rather remove one and put it in the other.

This is a Southwest Airlines Company that operates in the United States. As you can see Moderna's vaccine will come out, however, other Airline companies like BA with debt ratios of -14.62 will not do well. $LUV, however, has a debt ratio of 2.65, and the price of COVID-19 has already been placed in as the revenue as expected is not doing as well. However, their total assets have positioned themselves into a great place into the Airlines market. They have also raised 18.9$ billion in excess before COVID-19. This is much more than their fuel contract of 20$million

Their Earnings Per Share is currently negative. To solve this they must either reduce the amount of shares or increase earnings. This will them to drive their revenue up. They are in a great position to run the airline industry once a vaccine is out. Although their outlook for November is a negative outlook of -35% of passengers, they recently went offensive finding new planes and passengers by adding cities to their routes. They have no plans to increase their assets by the time COVID is taking place.

Key takes:

Best company for Moderna Vaccine News as they will lead the industry because it will take a very long time for BA to get out of debt.

>Southwest is likely to be the outperformer in the future. So if you want to bet on a rebound in the sector, then you’ve come to the right place.  
As long as the stock is trading above $ 38, a possible rise again to $ 40 and 42 could happen at any time. Above that, the way would be clear towards $44 and $46.

>Summary  
Among the stocks discussed, Southwest is particularly interesting for long-term investors. From my point of view, this is clearly the strongest US airline for various reasons.  
Delta and United are more interesting for traders. Both of them are much more heavily indebted and every positive and negative news has a big impact.

ilmd2k_DAL,DAL,"Moving from cash to DAL, LUV?","I originally sold a number of positions, converting to largely cash when the DJIA bounced back to \~26k after the initial COVID-19 drop. That included selling about 2000 shares of AMD at \~55...shares I originally purchased at \~3 (yea...ouch, but hey, I did fairly well long-term). The markets just felt too irrational. 

Anyways, I'm looking for another long term bet since I'm feeling too antsy holding cash. Most things look terribly overvalued right now. I get it, rates are basically 0, retail investors, etc etc. I still feel like a near/mid-term downturn is more likely than this continued meteoric rise. 

So considering the above, DAL and LUV feel like stocks that are still severely depressed compared to the rest of the market. They're the ""big boys"" of US airlines. They're still impacted by COVID-19 for obvious reasons. But with increasing talk of a vaccine before EOY, they're starting to look like long-term value plays. And if the market did take a downturn, I feel like they're actually a safer bet because their value is already so depressed. I also think that if there were a downturn, there would be no decline in current levels of travel because people are starting to feel cabin fever, and that's only going to worsen as winter arrives (I live in Minnesota).

gkefmo_DAL,DAL,$LUV in the Time of Corona,"After catching up on Buffett dropping all airline stocks last week, I decided to do a deeper dive into the airline industry.

After all, whether with or without a crystal ball, one thing is for certain: In a normal world, we need airlines in order to function properly, not only as an economy, but as a civilization.

Which means sooner or later, airlines will be running again (or flying I suppose).

Given that airline stocks have had such a huge beat down, I decided to analyze the ones that Buffett dumped. 

For one reason or another, they were once investable in his eyes, but now not anymore.

* American Airlines (AAL)
* Delta Airlines (DAL)
* Southwest Airlines (LUV)
* United Airlines (UAL)


Let me begin by saying that I’ve always had a bias towards Southwest Airlines. I was even invested in them ever since $18 and stuck them in my dividend growth portfolio. Their company has a great, economy-class flights, that’s very reasonable and affordable. Every flight I’ve been on is almost always full (note: anecdotal bias). 

Below are some numbers I pulled and calculated from Yahoo! Finance:

https://imgur.com/gallery/001C5rb

With that said, as you can see from the numbers above, Southwest Airlines is positioned better in terms of *liquidity* and *solvency* in relation to its other three peers.

They have the highest liquidity ratios indicating that they have sufficient cash set aside to cover their outstanding debt and interest payments in the near term.

Additionally, their interest coverage ratio is 28.22, which far exceeds the other 3 airlines, indicating that they could cover the next 28 interest loan payments at their current state. As such, they’re the only company that does not need a bail out.

Their debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios are also lower indicating a lower use of leverage and borrowings.

**Dividends**

Of the four airline companies, only three has historically paid dividends: American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines.

However, amidst this pandemic, Delta has decided to suspend dividend payments.

AAL has a history of paying a dividend of $0.10 per share, with the last payment back in February.

LUV has been paying $0.18 per share recently, with the last payment back in March.

Dividend payments can be a good signal of cash flow strength (or weakness). Given that AAL and LUV are still paying dividends, they’re probably in a better liquidity situation. 

**Southwest Still Has Huge Risks**

Given these numbers, it’s clear that Southwest is in a better position than the other airlines on paper. We’re still unsure whether there’ll be a full bailout of these airlines.

However, I would be very cautious with Southwest for the time being.

They have a huge risk right now, and that Southwest operates using ONLY the Boeing 737 planes.

As you may have heard in the news, there’s been a lot of problems with the aircraft in regards to its computer problems.

Southwest’s success depends on either Boeing fixing this issue or switching to a new airliner altogether.

Switching airplanes would hit them with a hard number in capital expenditures. Given that the majority of their airplanes are owned and only a few are leased.

**Burning Through Cash**

Additionally, Southwest is burning through $30 million in cash per day. According to their CEO, they may have to drastically restructure if they’re not in a better position by September 30.

In my eyes, this may involve its 737 planes I mentioned earlier.

**Oil Prices**

As we saw earlier this month, WTI hit a phenomenon and went negative for the first time in history. Lower oil prices due to a supply shock is good for the airline industry as approximately 40% of their operating expenses come from oil prices.

Unfortunately all that means nothing when states are locked down and travel restrictions are imposed.

**Conclusion**

While Southwest looks better on paper than any of the other airlines, we don’t know whether or not now is the right time to invest. Could the stock go down another 5 points? 10 points? It’s very possible. Or maybe we’ve seen a bottom for airlines. Who knows.

What we do know is that Southwest is cheaper now than before and perhaps worth picking up some shares for the long term (2-3 years).",2020-05-15,40,65

gj3lcr_LUV,LUV,LUV is a safer buy than AAPL at this point,"Airline companies that are highly unlikely to go bankrupt such as Southwest currently offer safer stocks than tech companies such as Apple, and here is why: 

AAPL has recovered incredibly quickly and was briefly back at all time high yesterday ($320). Going forward, if more bad than good news come, it has a long way to fall (it hit $224 on March 23). If more good than bad news come, realistically it only has a minor potential climb in the near future. 

LUV is probably somewhere close to bottom. It’s been falling steadily for the past month but similar, slightly riskier stocks like DAL have been relatively flat for a while now and LUV will be too as it finds its way to the bottom. It’s taken a little longer for LUV to fall because Southwest is a healthier company than Delta, financially. Going forward, if more bad than good news come, LUV won’t fall much further. If more good than bad news come, it can climb very high.

With this said, we do not believe AAL will go bankrupt since travel will likely ramp back up in the next couple of months.

2. Which airlines will likely be most successful?
LUV, DAL, and UAL will likely have the highest chance of success as their EBITDA to annual debt/finance obligations ratio is >1, meaning they can cover their obligations with earnings.

fvpz7x_DAL,DAL,Why Warren Buffet sold DAL and LUV,"We've all listened to the wisdom of Warren Buffet. He buys what he likes. He likes to hold forever. He likes to buy low. 

Why would he buy into an airline in the first place? They have extremely low growth potential. Look at the last 5 years of DAL. It's completely flat. 

A flat stock is perfect for selling options. Buffet is buying the airline not for their growth but to make money off a stable stock. 

DAL plummets and he can't resist. He buys stock that put him over the 10% mark. But he's a savvy investor. He bought PUTs to hedge his position. He wanted those cheap shares but when they fell even more he had to unwind his purchase by exercising his PUTs. 

Why did he want the cheap shares? To sell more call options. 

He's not going to dump the rest of his airline stock. He's going to continue to sell call options and make money off his investment. The stock will eventually go back up. 

He knew his exercising PUTs would cause the stock to sell lower when word got out. He likely sold even more calls near the money to take advantage of that fact. He may even buy more shares when it dips even further. 

Tldr;

1. Buy airline stocks to sell calls
2. Buy the dip with PUTs as a hedge
3. Stock falls hard so exercise PUTs and sell your stock at a higher price
4. Sell more calls before exercising your PUTs
5. Stock falls even more
6. Buy more

Number 6 isn't market manipulation. He's just exercising his PUTs. Who wouldn't sell stock at a higher price? And then go in and buy more at a lower price?

On the surface it looks like buffet bought high and sold low and is making bad investment decisions. But he's likely making money on every play. This is just one possible scenario.",2020-04-06,0,14

Revenue 5.6B

That they estimate the Boeing MAX grounding cost them $435m for the nine months ended september 30 2019.

In it they say they expect Boeing  to get approval to return flying the MAX in fourth quarter 2019 and that they expect it will take ~2 months after that to get approval from the FAA.  As such it was removed from their flight schedule until February 8 2020.

Currently they have 34 grounded MAX, and were expecting 41 this year that look like they will be pushed into 2020.

Due to the above, they have delayed retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft they had planned for Q4 2019, and they expect to retire 10 more during fourth quarter 2019.


------------------------------------------------
Others sources/info

SW's oldest 737-700 are from 1997 with a purchase of 63 in total.



SW today says they have doubled their canceled flights -removing roughly 300 weekday flights of their peak day schedule  daily flights of 4000 through April 13th


One major consideration of airlines is fuel cost.  The 737-700  has a fuel efficiency per seat of 87 mpg.  While the grounded MAX have a fuel efficiency per seat  of  ~121 mpg.  That is a 39% difference.

3fgxom_LUV,LUV,2 options:YHOO LUV,"I'm looking into adding another stock into my portfolio. 
Right now I own some shell, Microsoft, and a few other companies I put a small amount into.
I'm mostly trying to build a long term, dividend growth portfolio, but I also want to have some fun fun with short term opportunities. 
Now, though, I see 2 options.
LUV
I've followed southwest a while and wanted to buy in but I didn't have the capital. With their solid growth and beginning to raise that dividend this looks like, to me, a very good long term position.

YHOO
Yahoo is at a very low price and just hit a resistance point,, I think? I'm new to this. So, with their recent purchase of the online fashion company  they could boost their profits, and in turn the stock price.
Plus, they have so much cash, and could instantly pay off all of their debts. This would be a short term purchase, but I see easy money.
