The Trump administration has reversed course on plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, NPR reported on Wednesday.

The reversal comes despite months of work on new export controls and mounting national security concerns from both sides of the aisle. Nvidia’s H20 chip is currently the most advanced AI hardware legally allowed for export to China, and Chinese firms like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have reportedly placed around $16 billion in orders just in Q1.

Sources suggest the about-face was tied to Nvidia’s promise of new AI investments in U.S. data centers - effectively trading access to Chinese markets for domestic tech growth. The White House and Nvidia have both declined to comment.",2025-04-09,273,42

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

1jrlg11_IBM,IBM,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

1jrlg11_AMZN,AMZN,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,
🔴 S&P500: 5,078.40 (-9.00%)

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

My summary ends here, but many people have asked about tools that I use. I wanted to share them. If you're not interested, feel free to skip this part. :)

1jrlg11_TXN,TXN,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,
🔴 S&P500: 5,078.40 (-9.00%)

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

1jrlg11_ANET,ANET,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,
🔴 S&P500: 5,078.40 (-9.00%)

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,
🔴 S&P500: 5,078.40 (-9.00%)

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

1jrlg11_UNH,UNH,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

Apr. 4, 2025 Closes,
🔴 S&P500: 5,078.40 (-9.00%)

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

1jrlg11_NOC,NOC,"Week Recap: The S&P 500 has dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Mar. 31, 2025 - Apr. 4, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Mar. 28 to Apr. 4. 

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

Wow, what a week. Here’s a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 🟢 (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 🟢 (0.37%)

Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 - Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 🟢 (0.67%)

Apr. 2 close at 5,670.97 - Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 🔴 (-4.84%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 🔴 (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 🔴 (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

Mar. 28, 2025 Closes,
🔷 S&P500: 5,580.94

🔷 Nasdaq: 17,322.99

🔷 DJI: 41,583.90

🔴 Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

🔴 DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

The most important topic in this month is tariffs which will continue to discuss in the next month. Additionally, concerns about AI, recession fears, and mixed economic datas on the negative side. Occasionally, we had made jumps like government shutdown. In summary, the market faced multiple negative factors and dropped more than 5% in a single month.

The most important topic in this month is tariffs which will continue to discuss in the next month. Additionally, concerns about AI, recession fears, and mixed economic datas on the negative side. Occasionally, we had made jumps like government shutdown. In summary, the market faced multiple negative factors and dropped more than 5% in a single month. Today started with selling pressure and hit the 5,488.73. If the index does not recover, we may be looking at more negative month. 

As I mentioned in the title, The S&P 500 extended its losing streak to 2-months. Let's look at the numbers:

Sep. 30 close at 5,762.48 - Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 🔴 (-0.99%)

Oct. 31 close at 5,705.45 - Nov. 29 close at 6,032.38 🟢 (+4.68%)

Feb. 28 close at 5,954.50 - Mar. 21 close at 5,611.90 🔴 (-5.75%)

The stock market story is fully negative for now. However, gold and silver have jumped over 9% this month. The stock market had been shining in 2024. It had made a strong rally.

Dec. 29. 2023 close at 4,769.83 - Dec. 31. 2024 close at 5,881.63 🟢 (+23.3%)

January started strong, but that momentum has turned. The market needs a new factor for an uptrend, such as decreasing inflation, rate cut, or something. How was your month? Did you catch any winners like Berkshire or stocks in the Health Care sector? What are your thoughts on the next month?

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. 🔴

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. 🔴

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022. As a result, the indexes lost more than 2%. It was rough day. 🔴

Meanwhile, gold gained over 2% and silver surged more than 3%. Do you invest in them? I bought gold around 2300 and still hold it.

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The rising continued from the previous week. The indexes broke a 4-week losing streak. The S&P 500 gained over 1.5% and it reached highest rising level for the week. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited key data releases on Wednesday and Friday. Consumer Confidence released at 92.9 and its lowest level since February 2021, but it had not impact. The indexes closed slightly positive and extended winning streak to 3-days. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Trump announced new tariff plans for automotive imports. It triggered heavy selling pressure. The indexes lost around 1.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: The day started with GDP report which decreased from 3.1% to 2.4% (better than the expected 2.3%). There was nothing extra thing and the indexes closed slightly lowered. 🔴

🔸 Friday: The most important data of the week was PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure). Core PCE was expected at 2.7% YoY, but it exceeded expectations at 2.8%. The PCE is came matched with the expectations. It's 3% MoM and 2.5% YoY. I think, the more important data was 1-year Inflation Expectations. It came 5% and highest value since November 2022.

If you're using Android, you can try to search ""Heat map"" or ""Stock map"" on the Google Play. I don't know that this app available on the Google Play, but you can find alternatives.

🔸 TradingView: I think, it's the best technical analysis tool. I'm using the web version. I'm still learning technical analysis. Yahoo Finance can be another alternative.

🔸 CME FedWatch: You can search via that keyword on Google. This website is under the CME Group. They're collecting analysts expectation about upcoming Fed rate decisions. You can check projections to 2026 December.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Required info to start understanding options:

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

This week, two key data release are important. Q4 GDP (Gross Domestic Product) tomorrow and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) on Friday will release. The Fed closely watches PCE.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Wednesday: The Fed kept rates steady as expected and signaled continued monitoring of key economic data. The stock market reacted positively. 🟢

Tuesday: A quiet day with slight losses 🔴

Friday: After a calm Thursday, President Trump's remarks on tariffs and the Fed's rate cut. Additionally, the third Friday of each month is Triple Witching Day which typically carries negative expectations. Despite early losses, the stock market recovered and closed slightly positive. 🟢

Wednesday: The Fed kept rates steady as expected and signaled continued monitoring of key economic data. The stock market reacted positively. 🟢

Tuesday: A quiet day with slight losses 🔴

Friday: After a calm Thursday, President Trump's remarks on tariffs and the Fed's rate cut. Additionally, the third Friday of each month is Triple Witching Day which typically carries negative expectations. Despite early losses, the stock market recovered and closed slightly positive. 🟢

As a result, the futures market opened negative, but the day closed in positive territory. 🟢

Tuesday: After 2-day winning streak, the stock market opened lower. Concerns over Powell’s upcoming remarks on Wednesday led to larger than expected losses. 🔴

Wednesday: The Fed kept rates steady as expected and signaled continued monitoring of key economic data. The stock market reacted positively. 🟢

Tuesday: A quiet day with slight losses 🔴

Friday: After a calm Thursday, President Trump's remarks on tariffs and the Fed's rate cut. Additionally, the third Friday of each month is Triple Witching Day which typically carries negative expectations. Despite early losses, the stock market recovered and closed slightly positive. 🟢

The S&P 500 hit 6,147 on February 19, 2025, and then hit the lowest level at 5,504.65 on March, 13. This week, it closed 5,638.94. On Monday, Wednesday, and Tuesday the index tested the 200-day EMA, but it remains below. A breakout above this level could signal an uptrend. Meanwhile, 10-year bonds continue their downtrend.

Mar. 14 close at 5,638.94 - Mar. 21 close at 5,667.56 🟢

Day-by-Day Standouts;
Monday: The previous Friday, the government shutdown reduced fears. And then, the stock market was jumped 2%. In the weekend, Scott Bessent said ""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They’re normal."". As a result, the futures market opened negative, but the day closed in positive territory. 🟢

Tuesday: After 2-day winning streak, the stock market opened lower. Concerns over Powell’s upcoming remarks on Wednesday led to larger than expected losses. 🔴

Wednesday: The Fed kept rates steady as expected and signaled continued monitoring of key economic data. The stock market reacted positively. 🟢

Tuesday: A quiet day with slight losses 🔴

Friday: After a calm Thursday, President Trump's remarks on tariffs and the Fed's rate cut. Additionally, the third Friday of each month is Triple Witching Day which typically carries negative expectations. Despite early losses, the stock market recovered and closed slightly positive. 🟢

The S&P 500 hit 6,147 on February 19, 2025, and then hit the lowest level at 5,504.65 on March, 13. This week, it closed 5,638.94. On Monday, Wednesday, and Tuesday the index tested the 200-day EMA, but it remains below. A breakout above this level could signal an uptrend. Meanwhile, 10-year bonds continue their downtrend. I’ve completed my purchases and focused on the long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

Tuesday: After CPI, PPI also came in below estimates. Core PPI turned negative (-0.1%) and the yearly dropped from 3.6% to 3.4%. However, tariff concerns created pressure and then the stock market dropped 2%. 🔴

Friday: The government shutdown reduced fears. The stock market jumped 2% to close the week on a strong. 🟢

S&P500 hit 6147 on February 19, 2025, but has now dropped to 5,638.94. The lowest level at this week was 5,504.65. That means, the index dropped slight more than 10%. S&P500 is below the 200-day EMA. 

If we can get 2 day consecutive positive close, some of money from other assets like gold may join the game into the stock market. For now, economic data supports the stock market, but we shouldn't forget that President Trump’s is more important than all the data and technical indicators.

1jbv5dh_MAR,MAR,The Mar-A-Lago Accord - they are crashing the market AND the dollar,"So I've posted around this paper by Stephen Miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199\_A\_Users\_Guide\_to\_Restructuring\_the\_Global\_Trading\_System.pdf](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord. It's not a name of some conspiracy theory. This policy paper mentions ""Mar-A-Lago Accord"" as a thing: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html)

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Required info to start understanding options:

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

1dc0y5p_MAR,MAR,[MAR] Marriott International Stock Analysis (Beginner),"Hi guys the full analysis can be found on my new Blog that I started. It's my first ever write-up it may have a lot of mis-spellings as my native language isn't English. The Analysis is more Comprehensive on my Blog.

[https://stojanovicwealth.com/marriott-international-stock-analysis/](https://stojanovicwealth.com/marriott-international-stock-analysis/)

# Business Overview & History

Marriott is a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points. Their brand portfolio is huge.

At year-end 2023, they had 2,096 company-operated properties (589,078 rooms) and they had 6,563 franchised and licensed properties (994,354 rooms). This makes them the largest hotel chain in the world. I have computed the last 10 years of properties in a chart derived from the 10K’s from 2016-2024.

From what I can tell in terms of trends Franchise is growing faster than Company-Operated with 6.5% vs 2% growth rate in Rooms in the past 9 years. We are excluding the change from 2015 to 2016 as then Marriott had made a huge acquisition.

This Merger diluted Shareholders greatly with shares outstanding going from 255 Mil to 385 Mil. which is roughly a 33% Dilution to Shareholders. However, before the Merger and since then the management has been focused on aggressively buying back it’s shares. By now the outstanding Shares have again been reduced and are as of right now 285 Mil. The violet line represents the outstanding Shares. The black line is the Stock price in USD. The yellow squares are Dividends per Share in USD for LTM.

Now returning back to the geographical Distribution we can see that Marriott has 37,2% of it’s Rooms in the International Regions and 62,8% in US, as you can see bellow.

# Industry and Competitors:

The 4 largest competitors are Hilton, Hyatt, Accor and IHG. The following graphic shows the expected Total Industry Size is around $2TN in 2030. They are in an expanding and growing industry as world wealth rises travel industry should enter a secular trend.

Regarding loyalty programs, Marriott ranks number 1 worldwide, but Hilton is growing faster. We will look at competitors’ fundamentals in the Valuation and Quality Sections just to get an overview.

# Financial Analysis:

**Key Financials:** Revenue doubled from 2016 to 2023 which implies a CAGR of roughly 9%. Net Income tripled since then which is a rough 15% CAGR. We can see the company’s efficiency by looking at a very high gross margin of >80% and an operating margin of \~65%. That means the company is producing something for 19 cents, selling it for $1 and making a gross profit of 81 cents on it.

**Capital Structure:** Marriott doesn’t hold much of a Cash Position as it spends it Cash in buying back it’s shares and paying dividends to shareholders. The Debt has been rising lately but is covered very good with an Interest Coverage Rate of 7,5. Marriott’s Credit rating is also Investment Grade.

**Cash Flow:** CFO grew roughly 9% p.a. since 2016. The Company only has minimal Capital Expenditures due to its asset-light business model.

# Valuation:

**DCF:**  
Let’s get to the most important part, the price you pay.

We have a current share price of $231.10 and my DCF gives me a fair value of $112.47 if being extremely conservative vs a price of $197.36 if being very optimistic. Here are the assumptions:

I have although used the WACC of 10% for all 3 cases to be consistent. In my realistic case I model a 2030 Revenue Growth of 6% (in line with Wall St.) – an EBIT Margin of 64% which is similar to its current of 61%. – a WACC of 10% and a TGR of 3.15% which gives me a Price of 154.92 which in turn means that the current price of $231.10 with these expectations can be derived if we model the WACC to 8.25% – that in turn means we can assume a long term (>5 Year) Return on this investment of around 8.25% if my expectations are met.

**Historical Valuations / Exit Multiples:**  
Marriott is currently Trading at around its historical 10-year P/E Multiple and FCF Yield:

If we assume it will trade around the same in the future, we can take the modeled Earnings and Cashflows from the DCF and roughly calculate the expected return as the earnings and FCF Growth rate + Dividends + Buybacks.

This was used with the same expectations that the DCF Price of 154.92 was calculated to remain consistent. This equates to a rough estimate of a total return of 8.58% until 2030 if all else (Valuation, etc.) remains Equal.

In conclusion, I would say that the current price for Marriott International depends on the returns you expect to earn. While I think the company is not an exceptionally high-quality business as it misses the growth factor I think it has lots of other Moats that are hard to rebuild like their APP, like their Loyalty Programm, like their Prestigeus Brand Name, Credit Cards, etc. As the current market is very highly Rated I doubt you will get a much better CAGR in the Market (due to very high current Valuations) than Marriot expected which is around 8.5% (conservatively measured, if optimistic, possibly 10%+ if multiple Expansion or higher than expected growth occurs)",2024-06-09,6,16

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I own 7 holdings ($NET-UN, $AD-UN, $MAIN, $O, $ADC, $PDI, $MAR-UN) all of which I have varying reasons for (mostly dividend growth, tax free income (TFSA), etc.)

**My portfolio is currently:**

Since I'm 25, and loving the REIT sector as of late (I just see more deals in this sector specifically thanks to raising interest rates). I have been going a little 'insane' with it. I plan to add a few more REITs (MHC-UN, MPW (a FAT maybe), AP-UN (a FAT maybe), BTB-UN) then ignore it for the foreseeable future.

I'm valuing stocks off their dividend history, payout ratio history, sustainability/growth (UNII, AFFO, NII, DNII, FCF, etc.), and stock performance. But also going off their P/AFFO, P/FCF, P/UNII, P/DNII, etc. Which I think shows if a stock is trading 'at par', above, or below its normal valuation.

Note: I really enjoy researching stocks so if this seems like 'overkill' just know its extremely relaxing and I love doing this.

P/NII (Consolidated with absorbed fund):

Because PDI shares its annual results around Aug. we don't have any updated numbers to go off of so we will go off their NII (Net Investment Income + Realized gains) / shares outstanding to get a NII per share.  
Their results are an absolute mess due to the share price falling since Jun 2021, and varying NII before the merger in 2022 jumped the NII up a large amount.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

123koae_MAR,MAR,"Stock Market Today (as of Mar 27, 2023)","On Friday, the US stock market saw a mixed performance with the three major indexes opening lower but eventually ending higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.41%, the Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.31%, and the S&P 500 went up by 0.56%. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond decreased to 1.515%, marking a difference of -40 basis points from the yield of the two-year Treasury bond. The VIX dropped by 3.85%, Brent crude oil declined by 0.81%, and the spot gold price has been on an uptrend since November 2022, closing down by 0.75% yesterday at $1,978.25 per ounce. The US dollar index remained in a downtrend, ending at 103.13.

In March, the Markit manufacturing PMI in the US recorded a preliminary value of 49.3, the highest since October 2022. The preliminary value of the services PMI was 53.8, the highest since April 2022. So far, there has been an encouraging recovery in economic growth in March, with business surveys showing output accelerating to the fastest pace since May of last year. The PMI data is broadly consistent with an annualized GDP growth rate of nearly 2%, depicting a more positive economic resilience picture compared to the second half of last year and early 2023 downturn. However, the economic recovery is uneven, mainly driven by the service sector. Although there has been a slight increase in manufacturing output, this mainly reflects the improvement in the supply chain, enabling companies to clear the backlog of orders accumulated during the demand surge after the epidemic. It is obvious that new orders for manufacturing have fallen for six consecutive months. Unless there is an improvement in demand, the space to maintain the current level of production growth seems small. Traders have further lowered their expectations of a Fed rate hike, with the possibility of a 25 basis point hike in May now completely ruled out.

German Chancellor Söder reassured that Deutsche Bank is profitable and there is no need to worry, as concerns rose in the market about its recent drop in stock prices and rise in CDS. Deutsche Bank plans to redeem its $1.5 billion Tier 2 capital notes due in 2028 on May 24, 2023, and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The bank's five-year credit default swap (CDS) fell by 7 basis points from earlier on Friday to 208 basis points, the highest level since the end of 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose 1.395% to close at 3.488%, -50 bps worse than the 2-year yield. The panic index VIX fell 5.33%, Brent crude oil closed up 1.76%, and spot gold closing down 0.39% yesterday at $1978.8 per ounce. The dollar index continued to fall from its high level, closing at 103.29.

Goldman Sachs said that due to pressure on the banking system, the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise interest rates this week. JP Morgan’s chief economist Bruce Kasman expects the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. It is reported that the Group of Seven countries are unlikely to revise the price cap on Russian oil this week, although there is preliminary evidence that crude oil sales are well below the current $60 threshold. Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for Brent crude oil to $94/barrel for the next 12 months and to $97/barrel for the second half of 2024 (compared to previous forecasts of $100/barrel).

11ss55y_MAR,MAR,"Stock Market Today (as of Mar 16, 2023)","Last night, the three major US stock indexes fluctuated and dropped. The surge in Credit Default Swap (CDS) of Credit Suisse reignited risk aversion, and the energy, materials, and financial sectors dragged down the overall market. The Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index was down more than 4% at one point during the trading day, hitting its lowest level since the end of December last year. At the close, the Dow Jones was down 0.87%, the Nasdaq was up 0.05%, and the S&P was down 0.7%.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was down 5.93% to 3.458%, with a spread of -44 basis points compared to the two-year Treasury yield. The VIX was up 10.16%, Brent crude oil was down 4.88%, and spot gold has continued to rise since November 2022, with a 0.78% increase to $1,918.67 per ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high, closing at 104.75.

The US PPI, a measure of wholesale inflation, decreased by 0.1% in February, which was lower than the expected increase of 0.3% and previous month's increase of 0.7%. The year-on-year PPI in February was 4.6%, which is lower than the expected 5.4% and the previous value of 6%. The pricing of the Fed funds rate for the Fed rate swap suggests that the Fed is expected to raise interest rates by only 10 basis points in March. The US retail sales data for January was revised upward, but the data for February shrank. Experts suggest that the strong retail sales in January were partly due to the adjustment of spending patterns at the end of last year and early this year, as well as high inflation.

Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank, has announced that it cannot provide more assistance to the bank due to regulatory restrictions. This news caused Credit Suisse's USD bonds, which are due in 2026, to drop sharply to junk bond levels. However, the Swiss National Bank and FINMA have stated that they are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to provide liquidity if necessary. They also emphasized that Credit Suisse meets the high capital and liquidity requirements for systemically important banks, and that the problems in the US banking sector do not pose a direct risk to the Swiss financial market.

The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose 3.754% to close at 3.676%, with a spread of -56 basis points compared to the yield on 2-year Treasury bonds. The VIX fell 10.52%, Brent crude oil fell 3.78%, and spot gold has been on an upward trend since November 2022, but it fell 0.51% yesterday to $1903.8/ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high, closing at 103.67.

The US CPI has risen steadily in February due to the high cost of rent, with a month-on-month increase of 0.4% and a year-on-year increase of 6.0%, which is in line with expectations. There is uncertainty among economists as to whether the increase in inflation will be enough to push the Fed to raise interest rates again next week, especially after the bankruptcy of two regional banks. Some economists, including Goldman Sachs, predict that the Fed will pause the current fast monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s to avoid the spread of the banking crisis, while financial markets still expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. CME's ""Fed Watch"" reflects the mixed opinions among economists regarding the Fed's next move.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Silicon Valley Bank's information disclosure and executive trading. Signature Bank is being sued for providing false statements to customers, and a proposed class-action lawsuit aims to obtain compensation from the bank. Moody's has stated that the operating environment for the US banking system is quickly deteriorating, with a negative outlook.

The US military has accused a Russian fighter jet of intercepting and destroying a US drone in the Black Sea. The US government has notified its allies and is in direct communication with Russian officials to express its opposition to the incident. The Russian ambassador to the US has been called in for discussions. The Russian side denies the allegations and claims that the drone was not deliberately targeted and lost control due to a sudden maneuver.

11q3qql_MAR,MAR,"Stock Market Today (as of Mar 13, 2023)","On last Friday, by the end of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.07%, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.76%, and the S&P 500 was down 1.45%.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down by 5.196% to close at 3.704%, with a spread of -89 basis points compared to the 2-year Treasury note yield. The VIX index was up by 9.69%, Brent crude oil was up by 1.5%, and spot gold continued to rise, reaching its highest point since November 2022 and closing up 1.97% at $1867.04 per ounce. The U.S. dollar index remained at a high level but continued to fall, closing at 104.65.

In summary, while the US has experienced a prolonged period of better-than-expected job growth, the unemployment rate has increased and wage growth has slowed down. The labor force participation rate, however, has reached its highest level since March 2020. As the Federal Reserve considers whether to accelerate its rate hike pace, the report may provide mixed signals. The futures market has already priced in a 25 basis point rate cut by the end of this year, and the probability of a 50 basis point hike in March has dropped below 50%.

RLX Technology, up 15.07%, despite its recent increase in stock price, has experienced a significant decline in revenue and net profit in 2022, especially in Q4.

* ***Trading desk BUY orders are on hold until payrolls... No one is willing to ""step"" into ""another hawkish datapoint"". There may be some short gamma behavior into the event w/""forced"" institutional hedging. There are some MAJOR moves priced into the forward vol term structure (NFP / CPI / FOMC). In the last 10 days S&P 500 is down -4.5%, yet 10 day rVol is only 13%!***
* ***I still think that equities are heading lower - I am targeting \~$3800 SPX, but a large part of the positioning dynamic problem is starting to heal.***
* ***Are we there yet? - No. It's still time to T-Bill n' Chill... For the first time in more than two decades (since 2001), T-Bills yield higher than a 60/40 portfolio of stocks & bonds.***

***4) GS PRIME - LARGEST NOTIONAL SELLING IN 8 MONTHS, DRIVEN BY SHORTS 4 TO 1***

*This is a great stat from prime services. In the month of February, overall Prime book saw the largest notional net selling in 8 months (-1.2 SDs one-year), driven by elevated short sales outpacing long buys \~4 to 1. Most of the net selling was drive by Macro Products (ETFs + Index combined), but Single Stock flows were risk-on, with long buys outpacing short sales \~6.5 to 1.*

*Over the past week, on the US Prime book, Single Stock risk-on flows continued, with long buys > short sales \~2 to 1. All 11 sectors have seen increased gross trading activity, led by Info Tech, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary. In notional terms, Info Tech and Health Care have seen the largest short selling, but both sectors are still net bought on the week as long buys > short sales.*

We killed it with the CRM 3/3 175c calls, the stock is up 16% touching 195. Congrats guys on those who bought. 

This morning, the S&P 500 futures experienced a decline due to concerns over rising interest rates, which led to a sell-off in the market. According to a note from JPMorgan's trading desk, this puts the S&P 500 at risk of breaking below a crucial chart level, potentially accelerating bearish price pressures. Nasdaq-100 futures also dropped 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures saw a small gain, driven by strong performance from Salesforce shares. Other notable movements included Okta shares jumping on solid earnings and guidance, and Tesla shares losing 5% after the company failed to provide details on its next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day on Wednesday. Additionally, the rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. Investors are awaiting jobless claims and other economic data, while a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. A disappointing investor day for Tesla could also have broader market implications.

My posts don't get seen a lot, so those who chose not to follow my profile missed out on getting CRM calls yesterday. I'll also be doing weekly posts every Sunday on my profile only, so be sure not to miss those. Trade safe!

**Overall Market Outlook**

SPY - Bearish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200WMA and currently sitting above the 200MA and 200WMA on the daily. We also have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still squeezing on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.34

QQQ - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200MA and currently sitting above it. And we have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still in a squeeze on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.24

**Watchlist**

TSLA- Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We sold off and closed below the 8Ema on the daily. We also started to squeeze on the daily. And we filled some of the gap below but still have more to fill below 198.52 down to 197.67 area. That head&shoulders worked out in are favor! Take 205c or 210c Calls above 196.67. Take 180p or 175p Puts below 186.67. Expected Move +/- $13.30

NVDA - Three Black Crows candle pattern close on the daily TF. We filled some of the gap below and still have more to fill below 225.08 down to 211.04 area. And we closed right below big supply zone. Take 235c Calls above 230.50. Take 220p Puts below 224.15. Expected Move +/- $7.18

SKX - Skechers just moved higher off support around $43.20. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher as the stock swung above its 50 daily MA yesterday as well implying bullish momentum.

FOLD - This stick moved above resistance around $13.62 after reporting earnings yesterday which is where shares topped out on January 13th. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher.

LSCC - The semiconductor stock reported better than expected earnings last week. I believe we should see a move higher above this $85.54 resistance level which is where shares topped out back in November of 2021.

Btw, the mods seem to think the acronym for ""daily MA"" or ""daily moving average"" is some lowcap ticker, and the post gets pulled.",2023-03-02,29,4

11g41lj_OKTA,OKTA,Morning Briefing 🌞 Mar 1st 2023 - Let's make some money!,"[Previous Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/11e83ib/morning_briefing_feb_28th_2023/) This morning, the S&P 500 futures experienced a decline due to concerns over rising interest rates, which led to a sell-off in the market. According to a note from JPMorgan's trading desk, this puts the S&P 500 at risk of breaking below a crucial chart level, potentially accelerating bearish price pressures. Nasdaq-100 futures also dropped 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures saw a small gain, driven by strong performance from Salesforce shares. Other notable movements included Okta shares jumping on solid earnings and guidance, and Tesla shares losing 5% after the company failed to provide details on its next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day on Wednesday. Additionally, the rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. Investors are awaiting jobless claims and other economic data, while a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. A disappointing investor day for Tesla could also have broader market implications.

xcc5gh_MAR,MAR,"Nancy Pelosi & her husband added up to $50,000 in REOF XX LLC, bringing the total value of their stake to $350,000 per recent filings. REOF LLC recently purchased 5 Marriott (MAR) hotels across the US. Do you think this is a sign to buy hotel stocks?"," Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recently added money to the REOF XX LLC.

Congresstrading notes this LLC received $1.4 million in paycheck protection program (PPP) loans.

One of the sectors hit hardest during the COVID-19 pandemic was hospitality, which included restaurants and hotels. A member of the U.S. Congress could be betting on the comeback of hotels with a recent investment in an LLC that owns hotels.

What Happened: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recently added money to the REOF XX LLC that she has previously put money into.

As reported by Congresstrading on Twitter, Pelosi put $15,000 to $50,000 in the LLC on Aug. 24. The investment was reported today with a new filing.

The filing said this is an additional investment in the LLC that acquired five Courtyard by Marriott hotels: Fairfax, Virginia (1 hotel); Baltimore, Maryland (2 hotels) and San Antonio, Texas (2 hotels). The Courtyard by Marriott hotels are franchised by Marriott International Inc

Congresstrading noted that this LLC received $1.4 million in paycheck protection program (PPP) loans as part of the federal government’s program to help struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP loan was forgiven and used for payroll according to another source.

**Don't exercise your (long) options for stock!**   
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling harvests.**  
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your breakeven is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

tpvyxj_BNTX,BNTX,"Market Outlook - A Look Ahead for the Week of Mar 28, 2022","**LAST WEEK IN REVIEW**

In last weeks newsletter we discussed how the 200MA on the daily in the SPY could be an area of resistance. Well that selling/resistance did not last long. We had some selling pressure on Wednesday, and buyers stepped up yet again. Early Friday we saw some weakness in a few names, but the OVERALL market decided to push EOD and put in a bullish hammer on the daily and a very bullish hammer on the weekly!

Here is a look at some of the sectors for the last week and how they performed:

https://preview.redd.it/9edkmwgxf0q81.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c106d47d592ecaab105a0c28aa9048eb4b21129

**MARKET OUTLOOK**

The market has had an exceptional run last 2 weeks. Friday we started seeing some weakness but buyers stepped up again! The level to keep an eye on going into this week will be that 452.80-452 level. If we can maintain above this level, we could look to retest the next big resistance areas sitting at around 458.20 which was the double top dating back to Feb 2/Feb 9. The longer we stay above the 200MA, the more people that feel like they “missed the bottom” will start chasing these levels and drive the market slightly higher. If this does happen, pushes to 465/470 is not far off. However, if we reject the 453/458 we could look to pull back some and possible retest that 447/445 level!

QQQ however did under perform slightly on Friday, and on the broad spectrum of things, the Q’s are under the 200MA. The key level to watch is that 361/362 level on Q’s. If we can maintain a good push with increased volume here, then we could look to retest the 200MA sitting at around 368 and possibly get to 370. If we reject that 362 level, then we could look to roll back over and retest the 350s before attempting another move!

If we can maintain above this level, we could look to retest the next big resistance areas sitting at around 458.20 which was the double top dating back to Feb 2/Feb 9. The longer we stay above the 200MA, the more people that feel like they “missed the bottom” will start chasing these levels and drive the market slightly higher. If this does happen, pushes to 465/470 is not far off. However, if we reject the 453/458 we could look to pull back some and possible retest that 447/445 level!

QQQ however did under perform slightly on Friday, and on the broad spectrum of things, the Q’s are under the 200MA. The key level to watch is that 361/362 level on Q’s. If we can maintain a good push with increased volume here, then we could look to retest the 200MA sitting at around 368 and possibly get to 370. If we reject that 362 level, then we could look to roll back over and retest the 350s before attempting another move!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The entire COVID Crash only lasted 23 trading days while this correction is already at 34 trading days

While the S&P 500 is down 10% so far from its ATH, the FANGAM names which are often attributed to be the biggest contributors to the market for the past decade are down 22% from their highs. For most of the early stages of the bear market, people attributed these stocks to be the ones that were fundamentally holding up the broad indices while growth stocks plummeted.

SUPER LATE with this post, but I'm here with this week's watchlist notes! I wasn't available to do a livestream this past Sunday like I always do, but I told the Discord members to send me their tickers so that I could chart them when I did get some time. Below is what they sent me. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

Last week was rough for everyone (although I'm sure everyone will agree that the Powell pump on Wed was AMAZING) so I hope this week is a lot better for you!

\-Davin

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 6 // Targets Hit = 2 // Success Rate: 33%**

**$RIDE**\----No targets hit. Held the support we identified, but couldn’t fill the gap up to $18. Slowly bled off the rest of the week down to a low of $12.60

**$DNN**\----all targets hit on Monday.

**$AQB**\----first target hit on Monday. It was $0.01 away from reaching our second target. Been choppy all week, but still holding above support line that it was resting on the prior Friday during AH

**$UBER**\----no targets hit. Highest it reached was $61.02 on Tuesday, but that was still $0.28 away from our first target. Fell all throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, stayed above 200 EMA on 4hr chart from Wednesday to Friday. Now back above 23.6% fib level so could be a potential play heading into this new week

**$AM**\----no targets hit. Uptrend support didn’t hold and slowly trended down throughout the week.

**$PLTR**\----no targets hit. First target was missed by $0.28 which was during premarket on Monday. PLTR took a doodoo throughout the rest of the week and hit a low of $23.39

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*** \- denotes the plays from the viewers that I really like and will be watching as well

**$FUBO:** seems to be holding support along the 61.8% fib level which is plotted as $29.55. If that holds and volume comes through we could see a gap fill up to $35.77. It’s holding support really well AND showing low volume the past two weeks, which is great to see if you’re wanting to go long because it shows strength even with decreased trading.

PT if $29.55 holds: $33 (conservative) > high $35’s

&#x200B;

**$AMAZ:** looks to be holding the $0.0093 support well, however, it looks like it’s making a head and shoulders pattern (bearish) on the daily chart. IF that support holds, you can load up for the next spike up with a tight stop loss below support or based on your risk-tolerance/strategy.

PT: $0.011 > $0.012 > $0.013 > $0.015

&#x200B;

**\*\*$SPCE:** Looking at the daily chart, I’m thinking it’ll fall down instead of head up, but we’ll have to see what happens during PM and Monday. If it can reclaim the downtrend resistance as support, then we can focus on the resistances as our targets. But, I’ll focus on the downside for now with how the chart is looking unless something shows me otherwise.

PT: $30 (low of prior trading day candles) > $28 (200 ema) > $24 (0% fib level from drawing on downtrend)

&#x200B;

**$TME:** Has earnings coming up later this morning, which is likely why it had a small run the past three trading days. Looks to have made new highs, so it’s a bit risky getting in now. I personally hate trading things when it’s at new highs until it starts consolidating and making new levels, but that’s not to say there’s no money to be made. I drew a fib extension to see what we’re dealing with and it looks like it already made it to the 100% extension level and is holding it as support on the 4hr. Hard to make a prediction where this could go ahead of earnings as I haven’t done any DD on the company, but I’ll give targets shown with the support/resistance levels below.

PT (upside): low $31’s > high $32’s

PT (downside): $30 > $29 > mid $28’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*NFLX:** Pretty much trading sideways the past two weeks. Hopefully that changes this week since the earnings report is coming up in about a month. Need to watch and wait to see if it breaks out of the consolidation it’s doing right now. More importantly, it needs to get above that $511 level and hold it as support to push up. If it fails that, we could see it drop towards the 200 EMA and uptrend support line, but I’m leaning more towards the upside due to earnings.

PT (upside): $516 > $530 > $542

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AMD:** Great looking chart as far as a buying opportunity goes. It’s near the key support level ($73.71) of the consolidation channel it’s been in since July of last year. Price is sitting on top of the 200 EMA on the daily chart as support, but if that gives we could see it falling to the uptrend support/key support in consolidation channel at what point I’d definitely want to take a position either shares or options a few weeks to a few months away.

PT (upside): high $81’s > high $84’s > $87 > $89

PT (downside): high $77’s > high $75’s > $74

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RBLX:** Bounced off the support at $67.17 and now trading real tight along the 200 EMA on the 4hr. Will need more trading time to see which way we’re heading because we’re also trading within a symmetrical triangle. Could break up towards resistance (which I’m leaning toward the most) or down towards support at which point I’d pay attention for a bounce.

PT (upside): $72 > $76

&#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Will be paying attention to this as we have a current call option in play, but looks to be heading up from support (both the uptrend and downtrend) which is great!

PT: mid $121’s > mid $122’s > $124 > $125

&#x200B;

**$SBBP:** Currently charting this as PM opened up and it took the hell off (LOL). If it holds this level at $4.63 we could see a gap fill to the high of PM of $5.46.

PT (upside): $5.46 > $6.33 > $6.82 > $7.00

&#x200B;

First week of trading after some individuals started receiving their stimulus checks, as well as another Powell showdown this Wednesday. NASDAQ took a huge hit last Friday and futures are currently a bit green so hopefully those of you with tech-heavy portfolios get a breath of fresh air tomorrow.

I hope you have a great rest of your weekend and have a profitable trading week ahead!

\-Davin

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 9 // Targets Hit = 6 // Success Rate: 60%**

&#x200B;

**$MBIO**\----Fell on Monday, but recovered between Tues-Wed and hit second price target on Thurs

**$DKNG**\----All targets hit as the week progressed

**$NOK**\----Steady uptrend all week, hit first target on Tues, currently about to hit second target

**$PLTR**\----First target hit Wednesday, on steady uptrend since then and hit second target Friday AH, about to hit third target if momentum continues.

**$MARA**\----Fell on Monday, but reclaimed $31 support Tues, hit $38 target Tues AH/Wed PM, if we can reclaim $41 level, we could see our third target of $44

**$TQQQ**\----Started week out red, and failed to get over support levels to work towards our targets. Closest we reached was $0.74 away from our first target and that was on Thurs

**$HITIF**\----First two targets hit within the week. $0.06 cents shy of reaching the third target, but our second target is now acting as support. If that holds our third target is still doable.

**$BAC**\----Monday’s candlestick failed resistance break instead of breaking through, so it didn’t reach any targets. Closed Friday close to our first target and now sitting on the previous failed resistance as support so last week’s targets can still be used.

**$ATVI**\----Same as BAC above. Didn’t get above the 50 ema on daily and uptrend resistance like we were waiting for it to do and fell hard on Monday. It’s now consolidating between our support and our first target. Should see a break to the upside soon as indicators are showing movement to the upside building up on decreasing volume

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Livestream Watchlist (From Viewers)**

\*\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching as well

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RIDE:** Sitting on support on 4hr chart. Indicators look good although I’m still iffy on the MACD, but it is curling up. If it holds the $14 support, then $18 is the next target (61.8% fib level acting as resistance for current price). Could also be a good play since earnings is Wednesday.

&#x200B;

**$DNN:**  Daily chart setup looked great, but 4hr had a bearish reversal candlestick before it stopped trading this past Friday. I would like to see it hold $1.12 to $1.13 if it does reverse before getting in, but if it holds, I see it filling to $1.24 > 1.33 > 1.45.

&#x200B;

**$AQB:** Looks good as far as daily chart indicators go, but stochastics is nearing the 80 line so even if it runs a bit, it could pull back onto support at $7.46. That would be the best time to get in if that support level holds and indicators show that it’s still a good play. If that holds, targets are $7.90 > 8.25 > 8.60 > 8.84

&#x200B;

**\*\*$UBER:** Stochastics over 80 line, MACD already curled up and heading upward, and RSI is now in uptrend on the daily chart. However, the 4hr chart is holding above a prior resistance level as support ($60.13). If that holds, we should see $61.30 > 63.00 > 64

**$UBER Options Idea:** $60-70 strikes, 16 April 2021 exp date look like a decent play. Lots of volume and OI

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AM:** Daily indicators look iffy, but 4hr chart looks a lot better. Either way, price action is above an uptrend support level. If that holds, we should fill up towards $9.70 because it’s trading within a rising wedge pattern (bullish). Then we can look for continuation if it breaks up and out.

**$AM Options Idea:** $10 strike, 16 Apr 2021 exp, current ask is $0.30, lots of volume and OI as well. This is a safe play imo because it’s not far from strike price, the underlying moves pretty decently as long as we give ourselves time, and we have a month from exp.

&#x200B;

**$PLTR:** Returning from our watchlist last week...Still looks great for a swing play going off volume and indicators (excluding stochastics) on the daily chart. Try to get in as close to $26 as possible as that’s support IF the $27 price level doesn’t hold. If that $27 holds, that’s our support, and then I’d shoot for $28-29 as our targets.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tickers We’re Still Watching From Last Week**

&#x200B;

**$BA:** Put alert out last Thurs to ride the continuation of the resistance breakout on the Daily chart. Sold to secure profit Friday morning, but BA kept going up throughout the afternoon and into AH. Could still play continuation to our first target before we sold out.

**$NFLX:** Put alert out after seeing unusual options volume, analyzing chart, and seeing great setup. Ran over 100% the same day I alerted it, but held because of no day trades. Still up 30% on calls. Will look to add if it gains more movement or secure profit if it starts to show weakness and look for reentry.

**$TSLA:** Ate a hard loss after NASDAQ took a beating last Friday. Still holding calls and will look to avg down and scalp it at the open or swing it longer. Will see how price action goes.

**$AMD:** Put alert out after seeing same setup as NFLX, currently up 14% on these so, again, will add on strength or sell on weakness and look for reentry.

m5cgob_BAC,BAC,Plays For The Upcoming Week (Mar 15-19),"Happy Sunday [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/)!

Back again with this week's livestream watchlist notes! If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

First week of trading after some individuals started receiving their stimulus checks, as well as another Powell showdown this Wednesday. NASDAQ took a huge hit last Friday and futures are currently a bit green so hopefully those of you with tech-heavy portfolios get a breath of fresh air tomorrow.

I hope you have a great rest of your weekend and have a profitable trading week ahead!

**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 9 // Targets Hit = 6 // Success Rate: 60%**

&#x200B;

**$MBIO**\----Fell on Monday, but recovered between Tues-Wed and hit second price target on Thurs

**$DKNG**\----All targets hit as the week progressed

**$NOK**\----Steady uptrend all week, hit first target on Tues, currently about to hit second target

**$PLTR**\----First target hit Wednesday, on steady uptrend since then and hit second target Friday AH, about to hit third target if momentum continues.

**$MARA**\----Fell on Monday, but reclaimed $31 support Tues, hit $38 target Tues AH/Wed PM, if we can reclaim $41 level, we could see our third target of $44

**$TQQQ**\----Started week out red, and failed to get over support levels to work towards our targets. Closest we reached was $0.74 away from our first target and that was on Thurs

**$HITIF**\----First two targets hit within the week. $0.06 cents shy of reaching the third target, but our second target is now acting as support. If that holds our third target is still doable.

**$BAC**\----Monday’s candlestick failed resistance break instead of breaking through, so it didn’t reach any targets. Closed Friday close to our first target and now sitting on the previous failed resistance as support so last week’s targets can still be used.

**$ATVI**\----Same as BAC above. Didn’t get above the 50 ema on daily and uptrend resistance like we were waiting for it to do and fell hard on Monday. It’s now consolidating between our support and our first target. Should see a break to the upside soon as indicators are showing movement to the upside building up on decreasing volume

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Livestream Watchlist (From Viewers)**

\*\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching as well

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RIDE:** Sitting on support on 4hr chart. Indicators look good although I’m still iffy on the MACD, but it is curling up. If it holds the $14 support, then $18 is the next target (61.8% fib level acting as resistance for current price). Could also be a good play since earnings is Wednesday.

&#x200B;

**$DNN:**  Daily chart setup looked great, but 4hr had a bearish reversal candlestick before it stopped trading this past Friday. I would like to see it hold $1.12 to $1.13 if it does reverse before getting in, but if it holds, I see it filling to $1.24 > 1.33 > 1.45.

&#x200B;

**$AQB:** Looks good as far as daily chart indicators go, but stochastics is nearing the 80 line so even if it runs a bit, it could pull back onto support at $7.46. That would be the best time to get in if that support level holds and indicators show that it’s still a good play. If that holds, targets are $7.90 > 8.25 > 8.60 > 8.84

&#x200B;

**\*\*$UBER:** Stochastics over 80 line, MACD already curled up and heading upward, and RSI is now in uptrend on the daily chart. However, the 4hr chart is holding above a prior resistance level as support ($60.13). If that holds, we should see $61.30 > 63.00 > 64

**$UBER Options Idea:** $60-70 strikes, 16 April 2021 exp date look like a decent play. Lots of volume and OI

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AM:** Daily indicators look iffy, but 4hr chart looks a lot better. Either way, price action is above an uptrend support level. If that holds, we should fill up towards $9.70 because it’s trading within a rising wedge pattern (bullish). Then we can look for continuation if it breaks up and out.

**$AM Options Idea:** $10 strike, 16 Apr 2021 exp, current ask is $0.30, lots of volume and OI as well. This is a safe play imo because it’s not far from strike price, the underlying moves pretty decently as long as we give ourselves time, and we have a month from exp.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, for a gain or loss.**

**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

m06r0m_MAR,MAR,Plays For The Upcoming Week (Mar 8-12),"Happy Sunday r/Options!

Just finished typing up the notes for potential plays we covered earlier. Below you'll find said notes. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing) I usually post the video link as well, but it's much easier for you to look at the chart photos rather than scrolling through the 1-2hr video.

Lots of catalysts and news over the weekend as well as the Senate passing the stimulus bill so be ready for some great trading opportunities! However, I'm personally not going to be jumping in any long-term plays. I'm still a little skeptical about the recovery we had last Friday and whatever happens this coming week (even if we start out green).

I hope you have a great rest of your weekend and have a profitable trading week ahead!

**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 8 // Targets Hit = 8 // Success Rate: 100%**

&#x200B;

**$AAPL**\----Took a few days, but $119 target was hit Thursday after Powell’s interview

**$GRPN**\----HUGE WIN on this one! Hit all targets and blew past our “best case scenario” target

**$STMP**\----First three price targets hit ($165-188), almost reached fourth one at $207

**$RKT**\----$24 target hit and BLOWN out of the water! Doubled our target and reached above $40

**$STPK**\----Hit first and almost hit second target, but sold off right at the open on Monday and continued downtrend all week

**$BBY**\----Only hit first and second price target before selling off after earnings report, back at second price target as of this past Friday in AH trading

**$CZR**\----Hit first two long targets on the move up, then hit all our short targets on the way down

**$SNOW**\----Only hit first two targets before selling off

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

\*\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching

&#x200B;

**$MBIO:** was in a constant downtrend since January, but has been running along support since March 4. Currently holding above support at $3.09. The next resistances, which are also our price targets, are $3.31 > $3.49 > $3.90.

&#x200B;

**$DKNG:**  finally cooling off from that monster run it had the past week from earnings. It’s now showing strength on support and starting to recover from that support. However, it might meet resistance around $61.50 - $62. If it breaks and holds….

Price Targets: $64 > $66 > $68 > $70 > $74 (ATH / best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$NOK:** Was also in a steady downtrend ever since the huge meme stock fiasco. Starting to bounce up from support and show strength around $3.80. Next resistances, which are our price targets are.... $4.00 (conservative) > $4.29 > $4.57

&#x200B;

**\*\*$PLTR:** olding above horizontal and uptrend support on the daily and 4hr chart. Currently sitting near support so still a somewhat good time to enter imo. Next resistance is 50 EMA on the 4hr chart, next one is around $26. Some great news/catalysts came out last week. Should see some good movement.

Price Target: $26 (very likely) > $27 (conservative) > $29 > $32

&#x200B;

**\*\*$MARA:** Strong bounce off the 200 ema and horizontal/uptrend support on the 4hr chart. Look for resistance around the $31.28 area as that’s a fib level. BTC hit an ATH over the weekend, so the BTC-related stocks will definitely be a good play and worth watching. It might be a little too late to get in for a swing to the upside, but potential short swings or day trades could be present.

Price Targets: $38 > $44 > $49 (ATH / best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$TQQQ:** Strong bounce off 200 ema last Friday on the daily chart, also bouncing off support at $75.06 and heading up towards resistance of $89.04. Look for a break and continuation past that if momentum and buying pressure comes through.

Price Targets: $93 > $98 > $104

&#x200B;

**$HITIF:** The daily chart looks great, but the 4hr chart tells a very different story. RSI, MACD, Stochastics Slow still show we’re in a downward trend so it’s still too early to get in imo. Wait to see if it’ll reach the $0.5044 area to get in. If it does dip that low and shows strength look for….

Price Targets: $0.54 (conservative) > $0.59 > $0.70 > $0.88 (ATH/best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**\*\* $BAC:** Currently holding above support at $34.91, prior price action shows a high of $55 before it started to downtrend. The 78.6% fib level on the retracement from that downward trend is $43 so that is a great PT for a long term swing. Conservative PT I’d set around $39. Then the next resistances after that. The 100% fib level retracement is $54.95 so that is our best case scenario

Price Targets: $39 (conservative) > $43 > $54.95

**LONG TERM PRICE TARGETS! BAC IS A SNAIL. Moves <$1.00 move on average each day**

&#x200B;

**$ATVI:** Bouncing off support on the daily and 4hr chart ($91.78), but has to get over the 50 ema and uptrend resistance before I feel comfy getting in. Will have to wait and see what happens during PM, but if it does get over those resistances and shows strength, look for…

Price Targets: $94 (200 ema resistance on 4hr) > $96 > $99 > $104 (ATH / best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$HITIF:** The daily chart looks great, but the 4hr chart tells a very different story. RSI, MACD, Stochastics Slow still show we’re in a downward trend so it’s still too early to get in imo. Wait to see if it’ll reach the $0.5044 area to get in. If it does dip that low and shows strength look for….

Price Targets: $0.54 (conservative) > $0.59 > $0.70 > $0.88 (ATH/best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**\*\* $BAC:** Currently holding above support at $34.91, prior price action shows a high of $55 before it started to downtrend. The 78.6% fib level on the retracement from that downward trend is $43 so that is a great PT for a long term swing. Conservative PT I’d set around $39. Then the next resistances after that. The 100% fib level retracement is $54.95 so that is our best case scenario

Price Targets: $39 (conservative) > $43 > $54.95

**LONG TERM PRICE TARGETS! BAC IS A SNAIL. Moves <$1.00 move on average each day**

&#x200B;

**$ATVI:** Bouncing off support on the daily and 4hr chart ($91.78), but has to get over the 50 ema and uptrend resistance before I feel comfy getting in. Will have to wait and see what happens during PM, but if it does get over those resistances and shows strength, look for…

Price Targets: $94 (200 ema resistance on 4hr) > $96 > $99 > $104 (ATH / best case scenario)

&#x200B;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

lv0gl6_SNOW,SNOW,Plays For The Upcoming Week (Mar 1-5),"Hello all!

Just finished typing up the notes for potential plays we covered earlier. Some changes from my last watchlist post... I decided to leave out the video link and just attach chart images so you don't have to scroll through the video to find the specific ticker.

I still included the notes below for those that just want to read what we covered and don't want to view the images. If you want to see the chart images *with* the text, then you can find the Google document [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**\*\* $AAPL:** continuing to monitor this as we have March 12 exp, $119 Puts in play. Was worried throughout last Friday, but the selloff before market close is right in line with the resistance level. As long as it stays below $124-125, the downtrend is still in play. Need to be careful of $120 area as that seems like a good support level from the past 3-4 days.

Price Targets: $119 target (same as last week)

&#x200B;

**$GRPN:** huge move on earnings beat, pulled back a bit and holding above $13.27 (61.8% fib level support). If this holds, look for continuation back to ATH at $44-45.

Price Targets: $45 > $48 > $51 > $60 (best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$STMP:** huge selloff after earnings and back at key support level from previous price action. Look for strength/momentum to go long. It could fall more to the other key support levels at $165.67 > $159 (daily 50% fib level). I’m a little bearish on this as it’s currently below the 200 EMA and the RSI/MACD/Slow Stoch looks rough. However, if we can catch those support levels on the bounce back up that’ll be amazing.  
Price Targets (from $159 support): $165 > $177 > $188 > $207 > $231 > $285

&#x200B;

**$RKT:** Huge swing up above resistance, but sold off the gains it made. However, it’s holding above $21.53 (the 23.6% fib level) as support on the daily. Stochastics and RSI are curling up and the MACD is consolidating (on the daily chart). Shoot for next fib level at $24, but be careful as that’s a resistance it rejected multiple times in the past.

Price Target: $24

&#x200B;

**\* $STPK:** Super bullish on this, above 200 EMA, above the uptrend support, bounced off fib support (50%), diverging volume, RSI heading towards uptrend conditions, MACD curling up, slow stochastics heading up from oversold ---> All on 4 hour chart. Daily still looks bullish as well--above 50 EMA, uptrend support, and RSI curling back toward uptrend.

Price Targets: $35 > $38 > $40 > $51 (best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$BBY:** huge selloff after earnings (a huge one at that because it legged down one whole uptrend channel), could be a good over-exaggeration/long term swing play, however it needs to hold the $98.66 level for me to be confident to go long. I wouldn’t hold my breath though because the RSI, MACD, and Stoch look rough.

Price Targets: $100 > $103 > $106 > $110 (best case scenario)

&#x200B;

**$CZR:** huge spike after earnings and holding above 61.8% fib level support, could test ATH again ($94.43) if it holds. Used fib extension to give price targets should the ATH level hold.

Price Targets: $94.50 > $95 > $98 (100% fib ext level)----> going long  
$91.55 > $90 > $88 ---> going short

&#x200B;

**\*\* $SNOW:** Earnings coming up Wed after hours. I’ve made good money on SNOW before and haven’t traded it since then so I decided to revisit it. The 4hr chart looks great with the bounce off $254.54 (78.6% fib level), RSI, MACD, and stochastics look great as well. Looking for a fill back up to $275 which is the next key resistance on the daily chart that also lines up with the 200 EMA. We also looked at the call volume and there’s over 2,000 Open Interest (OI) and Volume on the $300 and $350 strikes. Was looking to hold fairly cheap lotto calls through earnings which is this coming Wednesday AH. Don’t think it’ll make the same movement as it did after the previous earnings (almost $100), but if it proves me wrong that’ll be amazing.

Price Targets: $267 > $275 > $291 > $300 > $319 > 376 (if it makes another $100 move)

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Good luck and I hope you have a profitable week ahead!

For those that want to scan for options activity, you can check out [options flow scanner](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) here.

**AMZN – Amazon Inc**

A player opened a $47 million dollar bet, short straddle, in AMZN last week. They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep. This bet looks like they aren’t expecting earnings to move Amazon that much and are trying to capitalize on the premiums from high volatility at the moment.

**BABA – Baba Holdings**

Big call buyer in BABA last week. Player opened a $55 million dollar position with 18,000 contracts in August 21 CALLs. BABA had a good run up recently, but has dropped slightly since reaching all-time-highs not long ago. This bet is suggesting the player expects for the stock to have another pop in the short-term.

**HUYA – Huya Inc**

Another Chinese stock in play was HUYA. This stock doesn’t normally see a whole lot of unusual options activity, so this trade stood out quite a bit. A player purchased 2,500 CALL contracts at 9% OTM with an expiration in October, 2020. This is a pretty directional bet with a high risk factor due to how far OTM the position is. The position is valued at about $600k and they are expecting the stock to rise over the next 3 months.

**ESTC – Elastic**

Player opened a long position that expires August 21, before the earnings reports for ESTC. ESTC is a cloud/software/SAAS platform, perhaps they are expecting the stock to rise as other tech companies report solid earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/kmkao1ne6ub51.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a529cfbece8d4794fdfa767f2696fe5bf20e3a1

**HD – Home Depot**

Saw some high call volume in HD on Friday. Total value of call positions was about $25 million on Friday where as a typical day for HD option volume is approximately 2-5 million daily. Biggest plays were both for August 21 calls at the 200 and 220 strikes with values of $18 million and $6 million, respectively. HD reports earnings August 18. The player is expecting the stock to have a good run up before earnings as expectations are high for a good quarter.

**MAR – Marriott**

Marriott has been seeing some bullish flow recently. Some positions that caught my eye were multiple positions of players selling PUTs. These could potentially be another leg of a bigger position, but it seems like the player is expecting MAR to have hit a bottom. As long as MAR stays above $85 (now $91) in the short-term then both players will realize maximum profit from their position.

**MRNA – Moderna**

Everyone knows the news of the MRNA vaccine. On Friday, players continued to buy into strength expecting the stock to continue it’s rise up over the next several months. $90 million in calls were purchased on Friday, most positions were relatively far OTM, which shows confidence in the bet.

horr4m_MAR,MAR,Goldman data show US consumer habit changes Mar vs. now - takeouts appear to be a lasting change in behavior,"Over the past 2 weeks (June 24-July 6), Goldman has been tracking US consumer responses (sample size of 2000) to the question, “How are you changing your habits, if at all, as a result of Coronavirus.“ Overall, 88% of consumers noted changing their habits as a result of the outbreak, which remains above 72% from early March (3/11), but lower than 96% at the end of March (3/27) as the pandemic was surging.

The data suggests consumers remain cautious, but are showing ""a decreased propensity to avoid public places, malls, air travel, and dine-in restaurants."" Concurrently, consumers remain much more likely to use carryout options and restaurant delivery than pre-COVID, and Goldman believes this may ultimately be a lasting change in consumer behavior.

Some interesting stats:

* 54% of respondents say they are still avoiding a sit-down restaurant vs. up from 28% on March 11, but lower than 72% on March 27 and 71% on June 24.
* Consumers are cooking at home less than March peak (54% now vs. 70% in late March, 64% in late June).
* Consumers’ avoidance of public spaces, malls, and crowds fell to 58%, just 5% higher than pre-COVID, and 33% lower than 91% reported on March 27.
* Consumers are also more willing to use air travel, with 46% of consumers they are avoiding air travel versus 67% at the end of March.
* Consumers age 45+ are reporting more social distancing measures, and less likely to use delivery.
* Consumers at higher income levels are socially distancing and cooking at home more.
* Geographically, consumers in the Northeast and Southeast are engaging in higher levels of social distancing.",2020-07-10,20,9

fossxx_LULU,LULU,"Jobs Jobs Jobs - not priced in. Puts on LULU, SNAP, CAR, MAR","TLDR: The job losses are far higher than the market has priced in, and will be the biggest factor in prolonged recession. They will take much longer to return to the market, and that is not priced in. HOWEVER, the number coming out this week will be much lower than reality as a result of administration efforts to dampening the bad news by spreading it over time, and while States scramble to scale up money and process load.

PUTS 

3 Apr LULU 135 - 17 Jul SNAP 8 - 15 May CAR 9 - 24 Apr MAR 80 

I am the buffoon that came on WSB who put 50k puts where his mouth is on [on 2/21](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8bhj7/bear_gang_application_50k_in_puts_for_the_ride/). 1.7 million+ YTD (not dancing, spending wisely)

Puts on 2/21 were on AAL, RCL, LULU, SNAP, HLT, on 2/24 added CAR, LYFT, MS 

You make money when you know what is priced in and what isn't. IMHO, The market has largely priced in all the stimulus, the sudden stops of the markets, and predictions of massive job losses. What is NOT factored in is just how many jobs have been lost, how long it will take for them to come back, and even if they will have a job to come back to. We know hotels, car rentals, retail is hurting, but there are layoffs positions you wouldn't expect across the tax bracket spectrum because of a portion of the job function being interrupted. Who cares if you can work from home, if you work can't be done because you rely on someone that can't do something at the moment.  

[Search queries for unemployment](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=how%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20unemployment) indicate terrible losses. The folks that get paid under the table, illegal aliens who work, and those in the legal pot industry will have limited to no access or protections from current federal stimulus. However the unemployment numbers pain will be spread out over the next few weeks. States were asked to limit the surge if possible, and will claim to be ""overloaded"", which will spread the surge over the next few weeks. States across the country you wouldn't expect like New Hampshire, are giving people a 4 hour window based on what letter their surname starts within which they can apply, and they changed that mid week to different windows! This is happening all across the country as the loads are adjusted and the states build the capital needed to support the surge. 

We have 15-20% more downside remaining in my opinion. The market is being held up by all means necessary this week, but this won't hold as the market will realize how many jobs are lost and how long that will impact spending behavior. Who the hell will be buying $200 athleisure at LuLuLemon when they are supporting their son, daughter-in-law, and her boyfriend who are moving back in. Once you lose the jobs, it takes a LONG time for them to come back. It will be a long year.",2020-03-25,268,216

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

What it means Longs / Shorts - these stocks have long or short bias. It doesn't mean we jump in blindly - we wait for proper A+ setup to form and confirm our bias. If stock is on long bias I want to see strength from the open and find area with tight risk so we would get 3-1 reward risk.

fki3t8_MAR,MAR,SPY MAR 20 245 puts - cash out or roll?,"I'm holding a few of these mostly as a bit of a protection/feel better complement to my stock portfolio.

Like most of us I'm fairly certain we haven't found the bottom yet and we might see $230 or lower levels, probably in the first half of April (or maybe tomorrow, who knows?).

I'm trying to understand if there's a way to keep holding these. Admittedly I'm a bit fuzzy with the concept of rolling and whether the strategy is applicable here. Rolling it over with the same strike price all the way to, say April 20, would be mightily costly. Is the regular strategy implies reducing the strike price and/or move it out to a shorter period of time?

Thanks for your answers.",2020-03-18,0,6

What I look for in longs is once the market opens, stock needs to hold opening range and be above vwap then I find A+ setup and hit it - for the short bias stocks it is the opposite of that.

eo3ku8_MAR,MAR,Critique my proposed hedge Mar 2020 QQQ position: 225/230 Call Debit Spread & Long 209 Put,"Reposting with a new title per mod suggestion lol

[IB Simulated Example](https://prnt.sc/qmspui0

Hello, I've been thinking about ways to protect my long call gambling habit from a market-wide correction.

After farting around for a bit, I ended up with a QQQ $225/$230 MAR20 Call Debit Spread + QQQ $209 Long Put. Has a P/L like a Put Back Spread, though doesn't require collateral. Debit isn't cheap, but the ""upside"" is huge and the ""downside"" is a wash.

I imagine there is already a name for this spread, and the fact I can't find it anywhere makes me think it is probably a pretty dumb trade as a hedge.

Would anyone be able to tell me what's wrong with this play? I wouldn't consider it a bet against the Bull, just a suck cost for insurance.

Thanks,",2020-01-13,2,4

You can also see my $MOS trade unfold live.  I used one of my favorite yet easiest strategies (vwap bounce/rejection) following the gap direction.  For example, if the stock gapped down, I short at the vwap OR if the stock gapped up, I long at the vwap.

The Board, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, will carefully consider the outcome of its discussions with the Consortium in order to determine the course of action that is in the best interest of Starwood and its stockholders.
