1j1h7i9_MA,MA,Oatly Repeating 30D MA & 150D MA,"MA - Moving Average The trend lines for the MA is 30 (blue) 150 (purple) I feel like I may have noticed a repeating cycle with Oatly moving average, if I'm right and Oatly closes above the 30 day MA than we could see Oatly close over $15 for a couple days, and if we manage to get the 30 day MA over the 150 day MA we could see a steady price movement between $12-15. 

 It seems like this repeating cycle is getting smaller and smaller, and may end here soon after earnings call. 

Whatever happens though I'm excited for the direction of the fundamentals of this company and our new CEO.

\- International Isotopes, Inc. (OTCQB: INIS) (""International Isotopes,"" ""INIS"" or the ""Company""), is excited to announce a strategic expansion of its company footprint with the recent purchase of vacant land adjacent to its current Idaho Falls facility (""Building A""). The Company has also entered a lease agreement, with the right to purchase the property, for a second building, which is located directly across the street from their Idaho Falls facility (""Building B""). These two forward-looking additions address both immediate needs for current operations and developing a comprehensive growth plan for the company.  
  
\- The lease agreement for Building B will provide the Company with near-term capability to double operational capacity, which is expected to positively impact all existing business segments. The Company has also secured a First Right of Refusal to purchase Building B, which boasts an 8,600 sf facility on a 1.73 acre lot. The Company intends to be able to shed a short-term lease in the area to offset costs because of the lease of Building B. INIS formerly occupied Building B in 2014 for DUF4 processing.

\- amended and finalized the Asset Purchase Agreement with AMICI, Inc., dated June 16th, 2023. To make up for a shortfall of inventory and assets INIS was to receive under the original agreement, INIS will receive the manufacturing molds, device registrations, trademarks, and all production rights to the AMICI, Inc. line of Xenon System products as well as the registered intellectual property to Swirler(R) and Tru-Fit(TM) Mouthpiece products.  (These are lung Therapeutics. 

 

**Market Size & Trends**

The [therapeutic respiratory devices market size](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/outlook/therapeutic-respiratory-devices-market-size/global) was estimated at USD 12.5 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2024 to 2030. The growth of the market is primarily driven by the rising prevalence of respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, COPD, lung cancer, and asthma. In addition, government initiatives and the introduction of advanced products by market players further support market expansion. For instance, in July 2022, OMRON Healthcare launched a portable oxygen concentrator using Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology. This device delivers high-purity oxygen (>90%) at a rate of 5 liters per minute by filtering out unwanted molecules from the air, such as nitrogen and argon.

**Technical:**

Crossed over 21, 50 and 200 MA  within the last few weeks.  Hasn’t held above the .04 support in almost a year and last time it held above the .04 it popped to 10.  Volume is weak but float is low with only 138M outstanding.  Thin on the way up as well.

 **Ownership:**

Again, penny stock so no institutional playing here so its mostly insiders. And they hold a ton.  Particularly Chris Grosso who owns/operates a small investment firm.  Some of the others in this firm hold some shares too so it seems a bit shady (penny stock).

**Revenue:**

It’s a penny stock, its not going to have skyrocketing revs but things are headed in the right direction.  They have enough operating runway to go at least another 12 months.

***HUGE*** 15.2% increase.

Goes from $0.66 cents per share/per quarter to $0.76 cents per share/per quarter. 

Current forward yield: 0.57%

Additionally, MasterCard announced a plan to repurchase $12 Billion Dollars of their shares. This program will be in effect once the previous $11 Billion share repurchase program is completed. This means our shares will continue to become more valuable as we start owning more of the company!

I hold MA in my portfolio and find it to be a non-cyclical, recession-proof company. MasterCard is one of the best companies in the world.

Basically my idea is to own these ETFs only while they are above their 200 day moving average, and then sell them as they dip below the 200 day MA. 

At different points throughout the market cycle, these sectors will preform better relative to their peers and the idea behind this strategy is that I try to always have my money in the sectors that are doing better.

Before I implement this, I wanna see how this strategy would have preformed historically.

1egn4p4_MA,MA,MasterCard beats quarterly profit estimates on sturdy spending,"Mastercard's second-quarter profit beat expectations as customers kept up spending heavily using its cards, sending shares of the payments giant nearly 3% higher before the open on Wednesday.

A tight labor market has ensured job security for customers, allowing them to make purchases without restraint even as the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy tight.

However, several of Mastercard's peers have flagged slowing growth, particularly from low-income customers, as wage inflation moderates and elevated interest rates weigh on customer sentiment.

Mastercard's switched volume, which measures the value of transactions processed on its network, were 10% higher than last year.

Cross-border volume, a gauge of travel demand that tracks spending on cards outside the country of their issue, climbed 17% in the same quarter.

Commentary from payments companies is being watched closely for signs that the Fed's rate-hiking campaign is bearing fruit.

Mastercard's profit rose 17%, to $3.3 billion, or $3.50 per share for the three months ended June 30. Excluding one-time costs, it earned $3.59 per share, versus the estimate of $3.51, according to LSEG data.

Its revenue rose 13% from a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, to $7 billion.

The company's shares have risen nearly 5% so far this year, outperforming its chief rival Visa's 1% gain.

Peers American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial have jumped 35%, 16% and 29%, respectively. Capital One agreed to buy Discover in a $35.3-billion deal earlier this year.

15ab6gf_MA,MA,Mastercard Demands Shutdown of Marijuana Buys on Its Debit Cards - $MA,"[https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RYDONHT1UM0W](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RYDONHT1UM0W)

Mastercard Inc. has told payment processors and banks to stop allowing marijuana transactions on debit cards, in a blow to the struggling cannabis industry and a boon to transparency in the banking system.  
“As we were made aware of this matter, we quickly investigated it,” a Mastercard spokesman said of the use of PIN debit cards on the company’s network for pot purchases. “In accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that offer payment services to cannabis merchants and connect them to Mastercard to terminate the activity.”  
Following cease-and-desist letters sent by Mastercard last week, companies that facilitated PIN debit payments for marijuana have been struggling to offer other solutions to dispensaries who use them, said a person familiar with the issue, asking not to be identified discussing private information.  
It remains unclear whether other digital options exist for marijuana shoppers. Visa Inc., which has also made efforts to shut down cannabis purchases on its networks, didn’t immediately return a call for comment.  
The crackdown means cannabis consumers will have fewer convenient ways to buy marijuana without cash. It’s a hard-won victory for banks and credit-card companies, which have fought to stay ahead of technologies that present a risk to their controls against money laundering and fraud.  
Second Wave  
The shutdowns mark the second wave of problems for the digital payment solutions that have sprung up to serve cannabis consumers. The first wave affected cashless ATMs, a solution that became a $7 billion loophole in the banking system. That segment was dominated by a company run by two individuals recently charged in a federal indictment with insider trading related to Donald Trump’s media company. They have pleaded not guilty.  
The current wave of shutdowns affects the use of PIN debit solutions. Commonly used at gas stations and grocery stores, they had also become an alternative to cashless ATMs to purchase marijuana.  
Dispensaries often struggle to figure out whether the payment solutions they buy from little-known processing companies are legal. Consultants on compliance in the US cannabis industry, where the drug is illegal at the federal level but legal in 38 states, said the shutdowns were already causing tumult for clients.  
“My phones are ringing off the hook — people are asking for payment alternatives,” said Peter Su, director of specialty banking at Hanover Bank. Su has run cannabis banking programs and consulted on payment solutions in the industry. Calls started coming in last week and have intensified this week, Su said.  
Hefty Surcharges  
While dispensaries can operate in cash, cashless-ATM and PIN-debit systems are easier for customers, who have been willing to pay hefty surcharges for the convenience of paying with a card. Those surcharges gave rise to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for an opaque industry of payment processors. The surcharges also hurt large banks that cover out-of-network ATM withdrawals; many were reimbursing customers for $2 or $3 transaction fees that looked like ATM withdrawals rather than marijuana purchases.   
While smaller, regional banks will serve cannabis companies, major institutions and credit-card networks like Visa and Mastercard don’t want weed transactions on their networks because of the federal illegality. Banks are also supposed to “know their customer” and be able to trace transactions in order to prevent fraud and money laundering.  
“Our rules require our customers to conduct lawful activity where they are licensed to use our brands. The federal government considers cannabis sales illegal, so these purchases are not allowed on our systems,” Mastercard said in an emailed statement.  
Little Headway  
The development will be a blow for the cannabis industry, where stock prices have been depressed due to a lack of headway with national legalization. Efforts to pass legislation that would give cannabis companies more access to banking services have also failed so far.   
Following the crackdown on cashless ATMs, some businesses turned to PIN debit, and the current shutdowns leave them with even fewer options.   
“More people have migrated to PIN debit in the last year and a half as the cashless ATMs have had issues. If the PIN debit solutions go away, it leaves people back with ACH or cash,” said Tyler Beuerlein, chief strategic business development officer of Safe Harbor Financial Services, which provides banking and lending to cannabis nationwide.  
While automated clearinghouse, or ACH, payment solutions seem to provide less compliance risk, they are unwieldy for customers, requiring them to provide a bank routing number and account number. Cash, while a mainstay of the industry, is said to be riskier for dispensaries because it exposes them to potential theft.",2023-07-26,31,21

1. Figuring out a MA period that works with the Kase bars, but the # of bars/day is too variable and doesn't work as well as the daily MA.

Jack Ma hasn’t made a public appearance in 2 months after criticizing Chinese regulators","Before this whole fiasco, I was high on BABA as were many of my peers. Jack Ma seems to have pissed off the Chinese government by publicly criticizing regulators and now he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.

The Chinese government doesn’t give a shit, they’re straight up mercenaries. They don’t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ’s sake, they’re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China)!! Point is, if they want you gone, you’re gone. I’m not informed enough to cite specific examples, but haven’t they disappeared billionaires before?? Not making a political statement here, I just want to make money...or rather...avoid losing money due to my BABA position.

Sure, Jack Ma could simply be laying low until the heat dies down. No one knows for sure.

My question is buy, sell, or hold?

My gut is telling me to sell and take the ~12% loss (I got in just a few months ago) and do some tax loss harvesting and repurpose the $ to something more stable. Otherwise, I fear my 12% loss can balloon to 40%. Thoughts?

jlv0kt_AXP,AXP,"Visa, Mastercard and Amex profits hit by lack of international travel during pandemic","Global travel screeched to a halt during the pandemic, and it’s hurting credit card companies’ bottom line. 

[American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP), [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MA) and [Visa](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=V) all reported double-digit drops in profit for the recent quarter, compared to a year ago. The companies pointed to a plunge in international travel as borders remain closed during the pandemic. 

Visa was the latest major card company to report results on Wednesday. Cross-border transactions fell 29%, while Visa’s revenue in the quarter was down 17% from a year ago. The company did not give guidance based on uncertainty around the virus, but said the cross-border weakness remains a “significant and continued drag on revenue growth.” That will likely continue into 2021, according to Visa’s CFO Vasant Prabhu. 

“The cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed, and there are significant impediments of crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions,” Prabhu said on a call with analysts Wednesday.

Visa rival Mastercard reported earnings Wednesday, with many of the same themes. Mastercard’s net income fell 28% year over year, and net revenue fell 14%, missing analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes, and did not forecast a rebound in travel spending anytime soon.

Shares of Mastercard have fared the worst in the past week, and are down 11% this week. Visa and American Express are down 8% and 10% this week, respectively.

Amex kicked off the card earnings on Friday with a 40% drop in profit from a year earlier. Travel and entertainment spending was down 69% year over year. While the company is “highly confident” that travel demand will return, “it will take a while,” American Express CFO Jeffrey Campbell told CNBC in a phone interview.

iui7gy_MA,MA,AMD about to test 50 day MA,"The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.

If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.

The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.

But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.

The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was. Any additional insight from anyone would be great!",2020-09-17,527,163

V and MA seem to be the safest but with less upside.

Now one of the things that interests me most when choosing a specific ticker to invest in is its moat or edge in the market. I was therefore wondering what separates these companies and what makes it so they can thrive side by side in the current market.

Street is likely to focus on 5 key areas - 1) how management will drive B2B payments penetration with its products and recent acquisitions, 2) potential partnerships in emerging markets like India/China, 3) any updates to long-term guidance, 4) potentially higher opex in 2H given recent acquisitions and ongoing investments, and 5) macroeconomic environment for the business. Valuation multiple has been expanding (EPS +19%/yr vs. stock +31%/yr over past 5 years) but the story remains one of the best ones in the space with strong secular growth opportunities.

# Description
MasterCard Incorporated is a technology company that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses across the world. The Company operates through payment solutions segment. Its offerings include loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting. The Company's services facilitate transactions on the MasterCard Network among cardholders, merchants, financial institutions and governments. 

Visa's kid brother? At $10bn of sales v Visa's $14bn it's not that little anymore. And wow has the growth been good the last 5 years.

## Recent financials 
|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.7bn | $9.4bn | $8.3bn | $7.4bn | $6.7bn|
|EPS | $3.35 | $3.10 | $2.56 | $2.19 | $1.48|

## Competition

It's pretty intense as they point out:

> We compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including: (a) cash and checks; (b) card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM and prepaid products, as well as limited-use products such as private label; (c) contactless, mobile and e-commerce payments, as well as cryptocurrency; and (d) other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments (ACH).

In addition to the obvious competitors, every tech company, bank, or telco would like to eat their lunch. And then there is government regulation to worry about, including the occasional anti-trust lawsuit!

Of course there would be... look at $MA and $V margins.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mastercard Inc | $9,883M | 55% | 64%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $6,515M | 28% | 30%
American Express Company | $34,594M | 27% | 23%
Fiserv Inc | $5,310M | 30% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $2,858M | 22% | 36%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $9,655M | 23% | 12%
Visa Inc | $14,280M | 69% | 24%

Mastercard Inc has $3,812M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of Mastercard Inc. Though I'm always a bit wary of cash figures for any business in a quasi financial services industry.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $108.34 for Mastercard Inc and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 22% to their target. 

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Now, I'm rarely a fan of businesses that are trading in the high 20s, but the growth has been good and they do seem to have *moat*. Is this a Quality purchase? Rather than Value or Growth?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ma/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

V | $182,493M | 27x | 14% | 1% | 4%

# Dividends
Mastercard Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.73 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.70 per share. That is a 4% growth. Given a EPS forecast of $3.54 it doesn't look generous.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 0%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 10%.

For me the obvious catalysts are earnings, the global economy and the move online. All are clear positives for the giants, $MA, $V and Paypal. But these aren't really anything to write home about :( Perhaps their is international consolidation in emerging markets like China, card adoption in markets like India that can also drive growth? 

And on the downside? regulation and the tech giants? Though given how slow consumer adoption is in finance, I can't see an immediate threat on the tech front.

3egosi_AXP,AXP,"Anyone have a favorite in the payment space? V,MA,SYF,PYPL,DFS,AXP,WU..","It s one of my favorite space to invest in and I've recently been branching out outside the US with ING.PA (http://www.ingenico.com/press-and-publications/financial-documentation) and WDI.DE (http://ir.wirecard.com/websites/wc/English/3000/news-_-publications.html)

I was wondering if anyone had a favorite (and why)?
I've been with V and MA for a while now, but I m curious about Paypal s future potential as well as what seems to be market discounts for certain companies in the space (SYF,AXP, DFS). I know some of those companies aren t really pure plays in payment processing industry (so they shouldnt be judged by the same valuations) but I would think they ll still benefit from the overall growth in the space. 

Any thoughts on companies I should start researching more? Or general thoughts on the industry?",2015-07-24,5,14

2injpz_MA,MA,Site to track simple MA indicators?,"Morning everyone, long time lurker, first time poster, I was wondering if you know of a simple site where I can say create a simple strategy, and have it run nightly and then email me the levels.  At its most basic, I'm thinking of a 10/100 ma cross model on like SPX, and it would email me the levels each morning when the signal would turn bullish or bearish.  I'm not looking for complex models, really just some basic indicators when to put on and take off my stock index positions.  Does such a simple site exist.  would only run on 1day bars, very basic vanilla turtle trading kind of stuff.

Thanks!",2014-10-08,0,15

1vm8pi_MA,MA,MBA vs MA in Econ for Finance,"I'm currently doing my BBA with a concentration in finance and a minor in economics. I am pretty much definitely going to be doing some graduate work as I love school. I was wondering what you guys think would be more appropriate for someone wanting to go into finance, specifically investing and more specifically probably either banking or fund management.

I've been doing some research and from what I can tell there is a considerable amount of overlap from the BBA to the MBA but, the program that I'm looking at also has the ability to concurrently get your CFA up to level to. 

I am really enjoying doing my BBA but also love all of the economics courses I've taken as well.

What are your thoughts on my situation, and some pro's and con's of doing either one.

Thanks!",2014-01-19,13,36
