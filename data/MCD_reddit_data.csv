1jdivey_MCD,MCD,bearish on MCD tariffs and boycotts,"

**TLDR: Still near all-time highs. Tariffs will raise costs and boycotts in EU, Canada will result in store closures, jmo. $15 B of revenue from overseas, vs $10 B revenue in US.** 

I'm bearish on MCD.   
It's just a bit off all-time highs despite significant risks due to tariffs and boycotts.  
US stores are just over 1/3 of global store totals... meaning this company is very exposed to global trade war.   
  
Boycotts:  
MCD is one of the most conspicuous US brands and always appears near the top of boycott lists.   
Don't think China or Japan will care, as population tend to be apolitical.   
Europe and Canada account for over 20% of global store totals.   
  
Tariffs are clearly a negative, as company has long supply chains all around the world. They will eat into margins or raise costs for consumers.   
  
Ag tariffs will affect imports of Australian beef. Reciprocal tariffs by the Chinese will affect anything coming into China from USA (most stores outside USA).

1im8ps9_MCD,MCD,$MCD McDonald's Posts Biggest US Sales Decline in Nearly Five Years as Earnings Miss Estimates,"McDonald's disappoints with Q4 2024 as Earnings Results miss estimates:

•	⁠Revenue: $6.39 billion (vs. $6.48 billion expected) ❌
•	⁠EPS: $2.83 (vs. $2.86 expected) ❌

The E. coli outbreak has made Q4 2024 the worst quarter since the COVID days for $MCD.

Despite being a global icon with over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries, McDonald's has encountered some hurdles.

My take on this starting with the bright side, McDonald's has been focusing on digital ordering, loyalty programs, AI-powered drive-thrus, and delivery partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash. Mostly aimed at boosting efficiency and sales.

The challenges aren't leaving anytime soon though, you can even go as far as saying higher Menu prices won't save them at all. It will only push low-income customers away. Which ironically, is already happening. There are also many reports about healthier eating trends. More consumers gravitate towards healthier eating habits and plant-based alternatives, hence the demand for McDonald's traditional menu items will weaken even more overtime.

Outlook:

•	⁠The company expects a full recovery from the recent e.coli outbreak by Q2, with improvements in guest counts observed in November and December, and positive feedback on their transparent response to the issue.

It's a mixed picture for McDonald's right now but what's definitely certain is that something must be terribly wrong if consumers are no longer able to afford Mcdonald's.

1hzbktz_MCD,MCD,Question about some MCD math/Due diligence,"I've been doing some quick back of napkin math and, well, like many here I'm pretty well regarded.  I did some preliminary checks with comparing MCD financial statements from 2019 to 2023 and I want to be sure i got right the decrease in average customer sales/traffic/economic interactions. (edit: thanks to u/throwaway_0x90, i do not have a position in this stock.  I was just doing some quick math and thought the DD flair was appropriate, will change to discussion flair if possible).

In 2019 MCD total revenues was $21,077 and expenses were $12,007 for a total profit before interest expense taxes etc was $9070.  For 2023, these numbers were:  $23183, $13182, $9371 respectively.  Now, with inflation these numbers should be (according to BLS inflation at the end of 2023 was 22.5%):  Rev $25,189.33 Exp $14,708.58, total profit $11,110.75.

If we just use revenue, because i wanted to check customer economic interactions with MCD it would mean that MCD lost -11.37% of its customer economic interactions. (difference between what was expected with inflation versus what was actually reported compared to 2019 as a base).

The rub comes in when I read a news report that Joe Erlinger stated that the menu price of MCDonalds items increased by 40% (may 29th, 2024) compared to 2019.  If we compare the numbers to 2019, a 40% increase in menu price should lead, if customer traffic held firm, to $29507.80 gross revenue.  But if you compare actual sales (the 2023 end of year numbers) to what it should be with a 40% increase, then MCDonald's lost 30% of its total customer economic interactions compared to 2019.  But that can't be right.  30% is huge.  

Its even worse with the skimpflation and profits after COGS but before taxes and interest, and i haven't done net income comparisons yet because you also have to add in the drop of cost of goods sold and compare that with overall inflation.

I just want to know where i might have done some math wrong or had an assumption wrong because 30% can't be right.",2025-01-12,13,18

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots.

**TLDR:** Short term short. I don't have an opinion on long term for this stock.

I will be entering the options route :  270 Put 17th Jan 2025.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). 
* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). 
* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). 
* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). 
* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). 
* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). 
* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).

September’s ADP report showed a strong boost in private sector jobs, with 143,000 positions added. If October’s numbers follow suit, the Fed might be smiling, knowing the labor market is still holding up amid their rate hikes.

Tomorrow, we get the first look at Q3 GDP, though it’s just the initial slice in a three-month data cake. Not the most precise reading, but still a useful clue for assessing the pulse of the U.S. economy.

And for earnings-watchers, two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks drop their results tomorrow, along with a heavyweight in Big Pharma and a legend in the condiment game.

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). 
* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). 
* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). 
* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). 
* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). 
* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). 
* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). 
* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). 
* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). 
* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). 
* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). 
* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). 
* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).

September’s ADP report showed a strong boost in private sector jobs, with 143,000 positions added. If October’s numbers follow suit, the Fed might be smiling, knowing the labor market is still holding up amid their rate hikes.

Ever since reading that book, I have been paying extra attention to McDonalds restaurants and I have to admit that the restaurants are surpringly good. Some small things that I noticed:

- It is impossible to accidentally throw your tray in the trash bin. The tray is bigger than the hole at the top of the bin.
- 9 out of 10 burgers will be good. The chance that you burger is bad, for example burned, is low (at least here in the two dozen different places I visited in the Netherlands and Germany over the years).
- The computer checkout counters are clear and work well.
- Going to the computer checkout counter and taking a number works well. You can peacefully make a decision and then just wait a few minutes for your order.

All in all they are incredibly reliable and efficient. But how do they do this? I've heard somewhere that they have very strict checks for the franchises, but I don't know what checks.

Are there any books on McDonalds going into detail about how the franchise is organized? What do modern franchise owners have to keep in mind? Do they get many checkups by headquarters?",2024-08-30,3,2

Now let's check its' daily chart. we could see that McDonald stock price is moving in a consolidation box after reached the support level of previous low. so it signals trend reversal if the price latter break above the consolidation area. on the contrary, there's a high possibility to drop more if it break below the box.

1efp3po_MCD,MCD,I SEE $MCD EARNINGS AS COMSUMER CENTRIC BUY SIGNAL,"McDonald's released its latest earnings report: revenue came in at $6.49 billion, with net profit at $2.02 billion, both falling short of expectations. McDonald's noted, ""This quarter saw a decline in customer traffic at our US restaurants... More inflation-weary customers are seeking value-driven options."" To attract diners, McDonald's is currently offering discounts. This strategy seems to be working so far.

1edri5l_MCD,MCD,$MCD is going to miss earnings bigly on Monday?,"Hello there crayon eater! Your favorite habit likely lead to the decline of sales in your local **Clown Burger** joint.

  
  On Tuesday, [$LW](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LW) Lamb Weston's(MCD Potato supplier) released their earnings and it showed a %9.25 loss of sales with around %27.62 loss of profit (EBITDA). They somehow blamed AI for that miss??? They used a new software that helps in managing and connecting all parts of their business, like sales, supply chain, finance, and HR, in one place and they blame it for the decline. Afterwards, the stock dropped %25 on Wednesday. 

  McDonald's accounts for approximately %14 of Lamb Weston's total sales. The profit margin of fries for MCD is between 70 and 80 percent. Moreover, fries make up at least 20 percent of the food menu item orders. The combined sales of Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets, and French fries make up about 60% of McDonald's total business.

 Another red flag, was them announcing a week ago that they're getting back the $5 meal deals. The need for reintroducing it signals sensitivity to a downturn, and that crayon eaters(like myself) cut back on spending. In other words, they wouldn't have to eroded profit margins significantly, if adequate people were coming through the door.

 Finally, while looking through Mcdonald's search impressions in the upcoming reported period, they were below their 5 year average by a mile. Also not to mention the boycott campaigns. 

First DD, not financial advice.

1dzei5e_MCD,MCD,🍔McDonalds🍔: At 52W low. How to make your easiest profits ever by holding earnings.,"Thank you for those who corrected the previous post.

Hello gentleman. 

First of all, the only DD that there is going to be in this post is in the tag. All information  here comes from trust worthy sources: MCD graphs and my confirmation bias.

Mcdonalds is at the lowest point in the past year. If you check it's graph you will find an interesting pattern: several arches of 245$ to 300$.

Last earnings mcdonalds was expected to deliver 2.73 - 2.71 EPS, but only got 2.70. Obviously the stock has droped a 20% since then (lmao).

This is literally a train ticket to 300$ per share. Next earnings are in 2 weeks. If mcdonalds delivers their expections (duh) we can see a rebound from a 52W low by september / december. 

Huge value investing oportunity to just hold, or to play for earnings.

1boarvh_MCD,MCD,Insulin stocks - Why they will spike following Mcdonalds - Krispy kreme collab," Alright, listen up, fellow degenerates, 'cause I've got a juicy play for you. You've heard about McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme teaming up to flood America with doughnuts, right? Well, buckle up, 'cause we're about to cash in on the aftermath.

**Why We're Loading Up on Insulin Stocks:**

1. **MCD-Krispy Collab:** McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme are joining forces to sling doughnuts at every corner. More sugar bombs = more cases of diabetes and obesity meaning more people buying insulin.
2. **Enter Insulin Titans:** Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi are the big dogs in the insulin game. They're the ones keeping diabetics alive and kicking.
3. **Endless Demand:** With the obesity and diabetes epidemic on the rise, the demand for insulin is only going up, up, up.
4. **Global Reach:** These companies aren't just chilling in the US. They're global players, tapping into markets worldwide where diabetes is a growing concern (like half the west are obese).

**Why These Stocks Are Our Golden Ticket:**

* **Eli Lilly (LLY):** This bad boy has been in the diabetes game for ages. With their insulin products flying off the shelves, we're looking at a steady stream of tendies.
* **Novo Nordisk (NVO):** The OG of insulin. They've been keeping diabetics alive since forever. With McDonald's and Krispy Kreme fueling the diabetes fire, NVO's gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.
* **Sanofi (SNY):** Don't sleep on Sanofi. They're a powerhouse in the diabetes market, and with the MCD-Krispy collab causing chaos, their insulin sales are gonna skyrocket.

**Bottom Line:**

We're not just investing in stocks here, fam. We're investing in a lifestyle. With McDonald's and Krispy Kreme pumping out more sugar than Willy Wonka, we're riding the insulin wave straight to tendie town.

•	Sales at food services and drinking places rose 0.1% in June, a slowdown from May’s 1.2% gain, according to retail sales data. Prices for food away from home rose 7.7% in June compared with last year, while grocery prices rose 4.7%.

  
•	Consumers torn between the costs of dining out or buying food to cook at home are frequenting cheaper restaurants. Fast food and fast-casual restaurants were 60.4% of total restaurant visits in the second quarter, Placer.ai data said. 

  
•	Analysts expect McDonald’s to report earnings per share of $2.78 on Thursday, with revenue of $6.3 billion, according to estimates tracked by FactSet. Same-store sales are seen rising 9.2%, but that is slower growth than in the first quarter.

w8ipf0_KO,KO,Earnings Beats by KO and MCD; KO raises full year outlook,"Coca-Cola Co.’s second-quarter sales exceeded expectations and the company raised its full-year guidance, as decades-high inflation and higher prices found consumers still willing to pay more.

The soft-drink giant on Tuesday reported a **16% increase in organic revenue growth**, which excludes the impact of items like currency and acquisitions. That **beat the 8.2% average estimate** of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

For the full year, the Atlanta-based company now sees **organic revenue growth of 12% to 13%,** up from its **previous estimate of 7% to 8%.** That’s despite an **expected negative currency impact of 9%.**

Earnings were **70 cents a share** in the period, excluding some items. Analysts were looking for **67 cents**, on average.


Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said the results reflected “the actions we’ve taken to execute for growth in the face of challenges in the operating and macroeconomic environment.” The company said it raised prices 12% on average across its products.

Coca-Cola continues to gain market share for its ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages. The maker of brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid has benefited from consumers returning to much of their pre-pandemic behavior after Covid restrictions were lifted.

Coca-Cola’s chief rival, PepsiCo Inc., said two weeks ago that it also passed on an **average product price increase of 12% to consumers** during the second quarter, and it increased its **full-year organic revenue growth forecast to 10% from 8%.**

McDonald’s Corp. reported sales that topped estimates as consumers continue eating out despite higher prices. 

The closely watched measure of **same-store sales rose 9.7%** in the second quarter compared with a year ago, the company said Tuesday. **Analysts were looking for a gain of 7.5%**, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. **Sales at US stores open at least a year climbed 3.7%,** while analysts projected a 3% increase. Adjusted profit also surpassed estimates, coming in at **$2.55 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.46**.

The Big Mac seller said US sales growth was helped by strategic price increases and value offerings. The company had said in April that some diners were trading down to less expensive menu options. The popularity of digital sales, including the mobile app and delivery, so far appears to be offsetting pressure consumers are facing from decades-high inflation.

The chain has largely been a winner during the pandemic due to its drive-thru lanes. **Digital sales** are also growing, topping** $6 billion in the quarter in the top six markets**, accounting for almost a** third of their total sales.**

Margins have been under pressure across the industry because of supply-chain problems and wage increases. McDonald’s said its** total restaurant margin rose 3% in the quarter, or 8% excluding currency translation.**

tbfz4n_MCD,MCD,$MCD$ Make McBank with McDanks!,"McDonalds has been dropping for a little over two months now. In total, it has dropped nearly 20% since it hit all time highs near $270 per share. It is now that I see a reversal happening in the stock however. It's drop coincided with a drop in the general market and was accelerated recently by news that McDonald's was closing stores temporarily in Russia. It has gotten to the point where MCD is now extremely oversold.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7naLkVdq

Seen in the image above, the rsi for MCD is well into the oversold territory indicating that at the very least, a sympathy bounce is bound to occur. Additionally, MCD bounced perfectly on the 78.6% retracement from it's rally from $200 to $270. Adding to the strength of this support is that this level previously served as resistance back in early Feb. Though this is the first time that level has been tested as support, it did successfully bounce on the level indicating it's strength. I believe that the bounce today in MCD will continue and that will be a good play for those looking into shares or calls. If you're going with calls, I would do further out and closer to the money to protect yourself a little. The volatility of the market makes everything somewhat unpredictable. If we are all lucky, maybe we can buy a happy meal with the profits.

tbsma3_MCD,MCD,MCD Good old Ronald,"Hi all, 

I've been watching McDonalds for a while, waiting for it to hit value territory. 

Not much needs to be said about the brand itself, and it seems to be capable of changing with the times, more healthy options, vegan menu, more sustainable sourcing etc. It's brand and brand loyalty are all time highs.

I've worked out an intrinsic value of around $220 / share, It's took a hit during Covid but I didn't have the cash to buy - it's now dropped down again, close to $220, mainly due to the closure of it's Russian stores costing around $50million / month in revenue.

Now, I just wanted a bit of a sense check to see if it is a value play, I think it will bounce back over time, but are we seeing a fast food giant that will now struggle to grow dramatically as it has very limited growth potential if you assume Russia is out for the foreseeable and perhaps the Chinese market will slow if they decide to side with Russia / sit on the fence and their sentiment for Western things takes a hit...

ta6jlt_KO,KO,"McDonalds's, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks exit Russia","McDonald's which has come to symbolize Russia opening up to the West post-Soviet Union, announced Tuesday that they will be shuttering their 850 locations in Russia. Of these brands, it takes the biggest financial hit. 9% of its global revenue comes from Russia, and they will continue to pay the salaries of about 62,000 workers.

**In recent days**, Pepsi, Coke, McDonald’s and Starbucks have drawn criticism for continuing to operate in Russia while other U.S. companies backed out and paused sales.

* **Yale Professor** Jeffrey Sonnenfeld compiled and made public a list of U.S. companies that have withdrawn from Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion — and those that hadn’t. Until Tuesday afternoon, Coke was among the most recognizable names on the spreadsheet.
* **“Our hearts** are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” Coke said in a brief statement Tuesday afternoon. “We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.”

Russia is one of the few places worldwide where PepsiCo has a larger presence. In a regulatory filing, Coke said its business in Ukraine and Russia contributed about 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenue and operating income in 2021.

Pepsi has sold its cola in Russia for more than six decades, even when the company had to trade its soda concentrate for Stolichnaya vodka and warships. McDonald’s opened its first location beyond the Iron Curtain in Moscow months before the Soviet Union collapsed.

**Pepsi generates 4% of its annual revenue** in Russia. They will discontinue selling beverages, capital investments, and all advertising and promotional activities. They will keep selling some essential products, like baby formula, milk and baby food in the country.

**What they're saying:** “As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,” PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

* **The Wall Street Journal** reported earlier on Tuesday that Pepsi was weighing different options for its Russian business, including writing off its value. Economic sanctions have complicated the process of offloading Russian assets.
* **Yale’s Sonnenfeld** makes the case for companies ceasing operations in Russia Since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, many U.S. companies have looked to reduce their exposure in both Russia and Ukraine. Some restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, have sold off some of their company-owned locations to local franchisees.

**Starbucks** went a step further than McDonald’s, saying it would suspend all Russian business activity, including shipment of its products. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson condemned the attacks in a letter on Friday.

LOW, HD, BBY, MCD, QSR.","I want to share some DD with everyone as I go through 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks, in order to find the best investment. Most of this info is from Schwab and the CFRA and Reuters stock reports.

Today I will go over **Lowes Companies Inc**. 

Ticker **LOW**

Large Cap with **Market Cap of 167.1B**

**Dividend Yield is 1.29%**, With a .80 quarterly dividend. They have steadily increased their dividend for over 10 years.

**P/E 26.92**

**P/S 1.67**

**P/CF 20.10**

Corporate Overview: Lowe's is the world's second largest home improvement retailer. As of January 31 2021, Lowes Operated 1,974 home improvement and hardware stores, representing 208 million sq ft. of retail selling space. 

Corporate Strategy: The company has brought on a new management  that is executing a new strategy with sharper focus on it's core business, divesting stores in Canada and Mexico in the past two years. They are focussing more in the U.S. market.

Home Depot is the market leader in this sector, while Lowes is lagging behind HD they do have an opportunity to gain market share in the U.S.  LOW has a home center exclusive on craftsmen products, which can not be found at other stores.

CFRA rates LOW as a BUY with a **12 Month Target Price of $275**. Share price at time of writing this is $244.50.

**Revenue** for 2021 was $89,587M up from $72,148M in 2020.

**EPS** for 2021 at $8.83 up from $5.49 in 2020.

FY 22 Sales target of $95B above the prior 92B range, 12.4% operating margins and $2.0 capex. 

LOW is also planning for $12B in share repurchases in FY 22 up from $9B.

According to CFRA stock report LOW is executing better on customer service and store management in 2021. LOW is still in middle innings of transformation with improved sales execution, inventory controls and revamped stores. New investments for lowes .com are also showing positive digital sales traction. LOW is moving large ticket inventory to regional facilitation centers from stores to speed up the sales-to-delivery process.

LOW is benefiting from the move to more home improvements and DIY projects from the pandemic which should continue.

Some risks include competition with HD, recession, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence and decline in home improvement projects.

&#x200B;

I hope this is helpful for people. It's my first attempt at DD and I took most of this data from the CFRA stock report which is slightly dated. I am open to constructive criticism here.

LOW, HD, BBY, MCD, QSR.","I want to share some DD with everyone as I go through 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks, in order to find the best investment. Most of this info is from Schwab and the CFRA and Reuters stock reports.

Today I will go over **Lowes Companies Inc**. 

Ticker **LOW**

Large Cap with **Market Cap of 167.1B**

**Dividend Yield is 1.29%**, With a .80 quarterly dividend. They have steadily increased their dividend for over 10 years.

**P/E 26.92**

**P/S 1.67**

**P/CF 20.10**

Corporate Overview: Lowe's is the world's second largest home improvement retailer. As of January 31 2021, Lowes Operated 1,974 home improvement and hardware stores, representing 208 million sq ft. of retail selling space. 

Corporate Strategy: The company has brought on a new management  that is executing a new strategy with sharper focus on it's core business, divesting stores in Canada and Mexico in the past two years. They are focussing more in the U.S. market.

Home Depot is the market leader in this sector, while Lowes is lagging behind HD they do have an opportunity to gain market share in the U.S.  LOW has a home center exclusive on craftsmen products, which can not be found at other stores.

CFRA rates LOW as a BUY with a **12 Month Target Price of $275**. Share price at time of writing this is $244.50.

**Revenue** for 2021 was $89,587M up from $72,148M in 2020.

**EPS** for 2021 at $8.83 up from $5.49 in 2020.

FY 22 Sales target of $95B above the prior 92B range, 12.4% operating margins and $2.0 capex. 

LOW is also planning for $12B in share repurchases in FY 22 up from $9B.

According to CFRA stock report LOW is executing better on customer service and store management in 2021. LOW is still in middle innings of transformation with improved sales execution, inventory controls and revamped stores. New investments for lowes .com are also showing positive digital sales traction. LOW is moving large ticket inventory to regional facilitation centers from stores to speed up the sales-to-delivery process.

LOW is benefiting from the move to more home improvements and DIY projects from the pandemic which should continue.

Some risks include competition with HD, recession, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence and decline in home improvement projects.

&#x200B;

I hope this is helpful for people. It's my first attempt at DD and I took most of this data from the CFRA stock report which is slightly dated. I am open to constructive criticism here.

LOW is at the top of my watchlist right now, I know HD is one of the favorites on this SUB and I plan on looking into them next as a good comparison.",2021-12-20,7,10

@mcdonaldscanada Announced and 
Is hyping the release of a new “Spicy” item. Unless the marketing team sucks and already leaked the build up, someone said it was the spicy chicken nuggets. Other than the nuggets being gross, articles have described the $BYND PLT burger as “Spicy”. A couple of years ago they piloted the PLT burger in Canada and a few other countries. Since I can’t post pictures in this thread, there’s tweets of McDonald’s Canada saying they removed it ( since it was a test run) and will listen to what the people want. Also McDonald’s released the chicken sandwich 18mo’s after Popeyes stole the show, with school back in session and restaurants  recovering this would be the perfect time to debut a healthy alternative to put pressure on the other chains. Also $MCD $BYND are both in a symmetrical pattern and  buyers held $BYND in a bull flag set up through the mini short squeeze rally last session.

Hero or zero. Even if this is completely wrong $BYND is setting up for a breakout

Beyond Meat and PepsiCo have announced the formation of a joint venture called The Planet Partnership to develop snacks and beverages made from plant-based protein. This is Beyond’s first expansion outside of plant-based meats, indicating that its total addressable market is likely larger than investors initially envisioned. The shares are responding accordingly, surging 20% on the news. If the venture is limited to the types of products already in Pepsi’s lineup, the Beyond Meat stock movement is likely an overreaction, as plant-based Frappuccino, Muscle Milk, and Matador jerky would likely not generate the $300 million in annual revenue needed to justify it. If the venture expands to other dairy and meat-based products outside of Pepsi’s current portfolio, the market opportunity will be larger, but so will execution risks as the firms move further away from their traditional areas of expertise. Additionally, while Pepsi has had several successful partnerships, not all its deals have panned out well.  The partnership with Pepsi is a wise approach to leveraging Beyond’s plant-based protein expertise and Pepsi’s marketing and distribution muscle in order to meet consumers’ growing appetite for sustainable products. 





🚀🚀  

Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat, or PBM, industry, offering the first burger to look and taste like meat, although it was soon followed by Impossible Foods and many others. Given the rapidly changing marketplace, it is too early to tell if Beyond’s first-mover advantage will result in a sustained market leadership position. A primary growth driver to be the 20% of consumers willing to adjust their habits to benefit the environment, as Beyond’s products emit 90% less greenhouse gases, require 93% less land, 99% less water, and 46% less energy to produce than their meat equivalents. PBMs will be very successful abroad, in China and India in particular, the world’s two most populated countries, each with 1.4 billion people. The products offer a great solution for China, which does not have enough arable land to feed its huge population, and a great fit for India’s large vegetarian population. Both countries are highly amenable to the products, with surveys showing 96% of Chinese and 94% of India’s population are likely to try the products, compared with 75% of U.S. consumers. The global PBM market will grow from $12 billion in 2019 to $74 billion by 2029 (a 19% CAGR), as PBMs grow from 2.5% of the ground meat market to 12%. Models show Beyond’s market share increasing from 2.5% in 2019 to nearly 9% in 2029, as PBMs gain a larger share of the overall meat category, and as Beyond’s brand continues to win with consumers, given its strong performance in taste tests and ongoing R&D investments.





🚀🚀🚀 

 There has been substantial consumer interest in Beyond Burger, which could signal modest initial brand strength, although the sustainability is far from a guarantee. The brand has been successfully used to drive traffic into restaurants. In the summer of 2018, A&W Canada, the country's second largest burger chain, ran an advertising campaign promoting the Beyond Burger, and the campaign drove a material increase in guest counts, leading to record same-store sales growth in the quarters following the launch, and the restaurant reported that it was the fastest new-product launch in the history of the chain. When Beyond Burger launched at TGI Fridays, it was also the fastest new product launch in the chain's history. Consumers flocked to KFC in Atlanta for a limited time test of Beyond Chicken, causing the store to sell out of the product in under five hours. That day the restaurant sold as many Beyond Chicken boneless wings and nuggets as it would normally sell of its popcorn chicken in a week. In April 2020, McDonald’s CEO stated the firm will launch a plant-based burger, but he was unsure of the timing. In November, the chain indicated the burger will likely not carry the Beyond brand, but we think Beyond will be a primary supplier, as Beyond helped to develop the product and few firms have enough capacity. The deal could add about $180 million in annual sales, increasing our valuation by 14% to $166.




🚀🚀🚀🚀
  
Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat (PBM) industry, launching the Beyond Burger, the first vegetarian burger designed to look and taste like meat, during the second quarter of 2016, shortly followed by privately held Impossible Foods' Impossible Burger, launched July 2016. While Beyond Meat is not the first PBM to hit the market, as wide-moat Kellogg's MorningStar Farms brand has been on the market since 1975, Beyond Burger revolutionized the category by targeting omnivores (95% of U.S. consumers) and first merchandised the products in the meat case in 2016. Also, unlike its predecessors, Beyond Meat seeks to make its products indistinguishable from their animal-protein equivalents in terms of appearance, taste, texture, and cookability. Legacy players (Kellogg's MorningStar Farms, Conagra's Gardein, Kraft-Heinz's Boca Burger) have sought to produce a vegetable- based product that tastes good, but does not mimic meat, which would not appeal to the products' largely vegetarian customer base. However, seeing the strong demand for meat-like PBMs from omnivores, several similar meat-like products, have launched over the past year. It took Beyond Meat seven years and Impossible Foods five years to develop a PBM that tastes, looks, and even bleeds like real meat. As the industry is in its infancy, and most competitive products are in the process of launching, it is too early to know if Beyond's first-mover advantage will prove prohibitive to overcome (similar to wide-moats Coke and Pepsi), or if the new products (most from well-resourced firms) will be able to quickly develop products that resonate with consumers. .




TLDR

🚀🚀🚀🚀

Plant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category. Beyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand’s strong performance in taste tests. Beyond Meat will likely be a major PBM supplier for McDonald's, as it worked with the chain to develop its plant-based burger, and few competitors have enough capacity to supply the large restaurant. A deal could add $180 million in annual sales.

I've calculated the Price/Book value of McDonalds to -23.63. What does a Negative P/B mean?

This is because the data I'm getting (Yahoo Finance) has MCD's  Book value per share as -8.97. Is this right? What does this value being negative say about MCD?

Bill Ackman declined to comment on the rumor that he would be pushing McDonalds to spin off its real estate assets into a REIT. The initial spike up began at about 10:51 EST. It took 7 whole minutes to hit its first peak. Any entry during that 7 minute period would have been profitable on the day. I picture a short term trade where a SPY short and MCD long could have been placed as soon as the news broke. This would have removed much of the market risk while buying the news. 
I know this is nothing new and hindsight 20/20 and all but I thought it was a fun thought experiment. Do any of you trade the news and would you mind sharing your strategy?",2014-12-17,2,18

2ott5m_MCD,MCD,I believe McDonalds is taking two steps BACK with this proposed customizable menu,"Disclaimer: I am short MCD.

With that being said, I believe the ""customization"" menu is going to be a train wreck. People go to McD's for the simplicity and ease of ordering and receiving their food in the shortest time possible. Not only does the customizable menu increase the wait times for an order, but that requires the ""robots"" behind the counter to actually do something outside of their routine. 


One may argue that many places offer customization without any hiccups (or at least few hiccups). However, the difference is that those shops originated with customization in mind. While the lines can often be long at Chipotle, Chipotle had the assembly line working since Day 1. Here, McD's is going to need to re-train hundreds of thousands of employees (someone can check that number) in order for this new menu to work.

Thus, along with weakness in sales overseas and in the U.S., I am going to remain short.

EDIT: To clarify, I have puts on MCD.
EDIT 2: I never called McDonalds employees stupid. I am simply stating that the employees are not being utilized in creative ways and most fulfill orders in a mechanical way as if they were robots.",2014-12-10,58,94

* Would you still recommend Tesla given how overheated it is?

* What are your thoughts on KO (Coca-Cola) and MacDonalds?

* I see big potential for Apple (and maybe Visa) down the road due to iPhone 6 and the recent news regarding mobile payments - if anyone can make it mobile wallets work, it'd be apple. What are your thoughts?

* Yes I have emergency funds and endowments and other stable long-term investments (mostly thanks to my parents), this 10K is just for me to dabble and learn more in stocks as I'm just starting out.

* Yes I am going to invest in a stable country-based ETF (my own home country, Straits Times Index) but am waiting for a new broker to clear a new index account for me - my current broker's high fixed commissions make it a bad idea to use for index investing
