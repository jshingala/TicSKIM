1kbnosv_GOOGL,GOOGL,Everything about META's earnings tonight,"Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ¬±10%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.

https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx

As we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause ""a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025."" 

For the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)

Advertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.

While Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company‚Äôs financial outlook for near future quarters.

‚ÄúMeta‚Äôs enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,‚Äù said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). ‚ÄúBut Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.‚Äù

Debra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: ‚ÄúWe attribute weakness to [Meta‚Äôs] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.‚Äù In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.

In the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company‚Äôs various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform ‚Äúromantic role play‚Äù even with the platforms‚Äô teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.

Keep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the ‚Äúpersonal social networking.‚Äù It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a ""buy-or-bury"" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)

‚ÄúMeta‚Äôs earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company‚Äôs future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,‚Äù said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing ""leaky bucket for Meta.""

Zuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company‚Äôs decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.

From what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush. Thoughts?",2025-04-30,47,31

1kaf5pp_META,META,What should I be looking at in the upcoming META earning call?,"For Meta Platforms (META), the upcoming earnings call (scheduled for April 30, after market close) is highly anticipated, especially with big tech volatility and renewed focus on AI, advertising, and cost control. Here are the most important things to watch and key questions the market will focus on:

# 1.¬†Advertising Revenue & AI Initiatives

* **Core Focus:**¬†Analysts expect AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and engagement to drive modest revenue and EPS beats, with estimates at $41.36 billion in revenue and $5.21 EPS.

   * Specific numbers and commentary on AI‚Äôs impact on ad efficiency and pricing.
   * Competitive positioning versus other social platforms and Google.
   * How AI tools are translating into measurable monetization gains.

# 2.¬†Cost Controls & Margins

* **Key Metrics:**¬†Operating margin, net margin, and cash flow are in focus as META‚Äôs cost discipline has been a major driver of stock gains recently.
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated cost guidance, especially R&D and infrastructure spend for AI.
   * Is cost discipline sustainable, or is spending ramping up again (especially for Reality Labs and AI infrastructure)?

# 3.¬†Reality Labs / Metaverse Segment

* **Trends Analysis:**¬†There‚Äôs been a major spike in public interest in Reality Labs in the last few months, likely tied to new product launches or AI innovations.
* **Watch for:**
   * Progress on AR/VR devices, user engagement metrics, and revenue/cost breakdowns.
   * Management‚Äôs view on the timeline for profitability in Reality Labs.

# 4.¬†Regulatory Risks & Shareholder Proposals

* **News Focus:**¬†Ongoing regulatory scrutiny (antitrust, privacy, content) and a notable shareholder proposal addressing online antisemitism and hate speech risks.
* **Watch for:**
   * Management‚Äôs commentary on legal and regulatory headwinds.
   * Updates on how META is addressing shareholder concerns regarding platform safety and governance.

# 5.¬†AI Spending & Geopolitical Headwinds

* **News Focus:**¬†Investor concerns about Meta‚Äôs AI capex amid tariff and trade policy uncertainty (especially with recent political headlines).
* **Watch for:**
   * Any adjustments to AI/data center spending plans.
   * Management‚Äôs assessment of tariff/trade impacts on supply chain and costs.

# 6.¬†Valuation & Guidance

* **Current Valuation:**¬†META‚Äôs trailing P/E is \~22.3, with strong growth (EPS up 62% YoY, revenue up 22% YoY) but recent stock price pullback (down \~28% from peak).
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated guidance for Q2 and full-year‚Äîare growth and margin targets intact?
   * Commentary on buybacks or potential capital returns (dividends, repurchases).

# What Analysts & the Market Want to Hear

* Evidence that AI is not just a buzzword but is materially driving revenue and efficiency.
* Confidence that META can navigate regulatory and cost challenges without derailing growth.
* A roadmap for profitability or meaningful traction from Reality Labs.
* Clarity on spending discipline and capital allocation priorities.

# Trends & Sentiment

* Public and market interest in Reality Labs is surging, while the core Family of Apps sees steady but less dramatic attention‚Äîpointing to high expectations for innovation and new product cycles.
* Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to any negative surprises, especially on costs or regulatory issues.

**Action Item:**¬†Listen for specifics on AI monetization, cost outlook, regulatory strategy, and Reality Labs progress. Management‚Äôs tone and detail on these fronts will likely drive META‚Äôs post-earnings price action.",2025-04-29,1,16

1k71dt6_META,META,Meta is laying off employees in Reality Labs,"Meta has laid off an unspecified number of employees in its Reality Labs division, a company spokesperson confirmed.

The cuts affected teams working in Oculus Studios, Meta‚Äôs in-house games division for Quest headsets, as well as some employees involved in the company‚Äôs hardware efforts, according to people familiar with the matter. Specific titles impacted by the layoffs include Supernatural, the VR fitness game that Meta acquired for over $400 million and successfully¬†defended from a government antitrust lawsuit¬†attempting to block the sale. A note on the¬†official Supernatural Facebook group¬†states that ‚Äúthese changes are meant to help us work more efficiently on what the future of fitness could be.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,‚Äù Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today. We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged.‚Äù He declined to comment on the cuts outside of Oculus Studios.

While sales of Meta‚Äôs smart glasses with Ray-Ban have¬†grown faster than the company expected, Quest sales have continued to struggle. The¬†latest Quest 3S, which Meta released last fall, is currently¬†on sale for roughly 10 percent off¬†in some configurations.

LONDON (Reuters) -European Union regulators on Wednesday imposed fines on Apple and Meta totalling 700 million euros ($877 million) for violating new antitrust rules, the first sanctions under landmark legislation aimed at curbing Big Tech's power.

Here is some reaction to the penalties:

APPLE IN AN EMAILED STATEMENT:

""Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""

META IN AN EMAILED STATEMENT:

""The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.

""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model, effectively imposing a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service.""

""FORTNITE"" MAKER EPIC GAMES CEO TIM SWEENEY:

""Great news for app developers worldwide! (...) Today's decision benefits all developers - European developers and American developers alike. It highlights the need for America to similarly pass the Open App Markets Act to bring competition back to digital markets.

""Lobbyists and shills funded by American Big Tech had better not misportray Europe's modest fine for Apple's lawbreaking as a ""European tax on American companies"". To do so would be to try to gaslight the administration into a trade war to protect Apple's lawlessness.""

ANDREAS AUDRETSCH, DEPUTY PARLIAMENTARY LEADER OF GREEN PARTY IN GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT:

""The fines (...) are clearly too low. The Commission should have taken tougher action; in previous proceedings, the Commission had imposed significantly higher fines in the billions.

""There must be no doubt that the Commission is prepared to exhaust all legal means to enforce European law. This is particularly important at a time when Donald Trump and U.S. tech oligarchs are deliberately trying to undermine European law.

""There must be no subjugation of Europe. If Apple and Meta let the 60-day deadline pass without paying the fines, further steps must be taken.""

COMPUTER & COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (CCIA) EUROPE'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF OFFICE DANIEL FRIEDLAENDER:

""The DMA‚Äôs (Digital Markets Act) credibility is being weakened by its unpredictable enforcement and shifting demands, combined with sweeping product-design mandates from the European Commission that disrupt the user experience and limit EU businesses' ability to reach consumers.""

""(...) The DMA has become highly politicised, and could even force some companies to provide services at a loss. There is a huge opportunity for regulatory simplification in Europe ‚Äì so far, however, the DMA decisions are going in the opposite direction.""

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS' (IAPP) DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH & INSIGHTS JOE JONES:

""The fines land at a time of heightened scrutiny by the current U.S. Administration on the application of EU laws to U.S. companies.

""(...) Open questions include not only how will addressed companies respond to EU regulatory enforcement but how will overseas governments, including and especially the U.S., respond. The U.S. Administration has declared it will consider responsive actions like tariffs to combat certain foreign government policies levied against U.S. companies.

""The EU‚Äôs digital rulebook not only has grown in size but has grown more complex as well as robust in its application, with fines and corrective measures being imposed.

EUROPEAN CONSUMER GROUP BEUC DIRECTOR GENERAL AGUSTIN REYNA:

""Today‚Äôs decisions are important to show Big Tech that if they choose to operate on the EU's Single Market they must play by our rules.

""Apple and Meta have had ample time to comply with the (DMA) but instead have delayed compliance and tried to twist the rules to their advantage. Consumers deserve better choices, and businesses need fairer market conditions in digital markets, so the Commission must enforce the law.

""The (DMA) is a gamechanger in terms of opening up digital markets to more competition. The Commission must enforce the (law) effectively so that gatekeepers comply with all its provisions and consumers can reap the benefits of more and better choice in digital services.""

RASMUS ANDRESEN, BUDGET AND FINANCIAL SPOKESPERSON FOR THE GREENS/EFA IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:

""It is a long-overdue and important step that the EU Commission is finally using its regulatory power to rein in the U.S. tech giants.

""(...) With this action, Europe is sending a clear signal: the digital internal market is not a lawless space for billion-dollar tech companies. It is about fairness, real competition, and the protection of consumer rights and small businesses.

""Trump‚Äôs calls for an end to EU tech regulation are extremely dangerous. It is good that the EU Commission is responding with the application of legislation. We decide on our own rules.

""But competition rules alone are not enough. We also need consistent and fair taxation of tech companies. It is unacceptable that an entire industry makes massive profits while simultaneously avoiding its responsibilities to society. The EU Commission should finally present a proposal to fairly tax the large tech companies in Europe.""

GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON:

""More competition in the European Union benefits not only consumers, but also all European, as well as non-European, SMEs and start-ups.""

1jkn38c_META,META,"Meta Investing Thesis: Still Compounding, Still Dominating","Meta has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in tech history. After being written off in 2022 amid Apple‚Äôs privacy changes, TikTok competition, and an uncertain metaverse pivot, the company has bounced back stronger than ever. Its ad engine is running hot again, user engagement is rising, and it's making massive AI infrastructure investments to future-proof the business. With durable moats, expanding monetization surfaces, and strong financial discipline, Meta is no longer just a recovery story ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mature compounding machine with clear upside potential from here.

* **Financial resurgence:** $164.5B revenue (+22% YoY), $62.3B net income (+59%), 42% operating margin, and $52.1B in free cash flow in 2024. ROE stood at \~34%, showcasing strong capital efficiency at scale.
* **Durable moats:** Meta‚Äôs 4B+ user base powers an unmatched data advantage. Its AI feedback loop, social graph, multi-surface presence (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and cross-app identity infrastructure create high switching costs and network effects that competitors can't replicate.
* **AI infrastructure bet:** Meta is investing $60‚Äì65B in 2025 to scale its AI infrastructure ‚Äî including custom silicon (MTIA chips), Llama foundation models, and massive inference-optimized data centers. These are mostly fixed costs, setting up future operating leverage as growth Capex tapers.
* **Next leg of growth:**
   1. **Messaging monetization** ‚Äî Click-to-Message ads, in-chat commerce, and AI agents on WhatsApp and Instagram
   2. **AI-driven ads** ‚Äî Automated campaign creation (Advantage+), performance boosts for SMBs and creators
   3. **AR/VR optionality** ‚Äî Quest 3, smart glasses, and a path toward mass-market AR by 2027. This is more of optionality now. If this works out, can create significant additional revenue. 

* **Valuation (Base Case):** EPS grows to \~$44 by 2029 with steady 10‚Äì11% top-line growth. At a 20x multiple, the stock could reach \~$875 ‚Üí **\~6.9% CAGR from today**.
* **Valuation (Bull Case):** If WhatsApp hits $20B+ revenue and AI tools gain traction, EPS could hit $50 by 2030. At 25x multiple ‚Üí **$1,250 stock (\~12.6% CAGR)**.

  
In summary, Meta has transformed from a struggling giant in 2022 to a cash-generating, AI-powered compounding machine in 2025. With $62B in profit, 4B users, deep data moats, and massive AI infrastructure bets, it‚Äôs positioned for steady, long-term growth across ads and messaging with the Reality Labs optionality.

1jjn3di_META,META,Meta Plans $14/Month Ad-Free Subscription for Instagram and Facebook Amid Privacy Scrutiny,"According to a recent report from¬†*The Wall Street Journal*, Meta Platforms Inc. is considering introducing a subscription model for its social media services. Users would have the option to pay $14 per month for an ad-free experience on Instagram or Facebook. This move appears to be a response to mounting scrutiny over data privacy and the company‚Äôs advertising practices.

The proposed subscription aims to give users greater control over their online experience by removing advertisements. However, it raises important questions about the future of social media monetization and user engagement. Will people be willing to pay for a service that has traditionally been free but ad-supported? And how will this shift affect Meta‚Äôs business model, which still relies heavily on ad revenue?

This development comes on the heels of a notable legal case involving British human rights campaigner Tanya O‚ÄôCarroll. She sued Meta, arguing that its practice of delivering personalized ads without her explicit consent violated UK data protection laws. The case ended in a settlement, with Meta agreeing to stop using O‚ÄôCarroll‚Äôs personal data for targeted advertising‚Äîpotentially setting a broader precedent for user privacy rights in the digital space.

In light of such pressure, Meta has been exploring new models to better align with regulatory demands and user expectations. In the EU, it has already introduced a subscription offering, priced around ‚Ç¨10 per month on desktop and ‚Ç¨13 on mobile devices, reflecting app store commissions.

With regulators cracking down on data usage and users becoming more aware of their digital rights, this subscription model could serve as Meta‚Äôs way of offering a ‚Äúpay-for-privacy‚Äù option‚Äîwhile also diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional advertising by providing an alternative user experience and creating a new source of income.

Amazon, Alphabet‚Äôs Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won‚Äôt provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",2025-03-12,369,39

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-04/meta-opens-llama-ai-models-to-us-defense-agencies-contractors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-04/meta-opens-llama-ai-models-to-us-defense-agencies-contractors)

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

1ism9uy_META,META,Meta‚Äôs Historic 20-Day Winning Streak Poised to End ‚Äì Longest Among Big Tech,"Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is poised to conclude its unprecedented 20-day winning streak, with shares currently down 3.8% at $708.25. This rally, the longest among S&P 500 companies since at least 1980, began on January 16, 2025.  Ôøº


The surge in stock price has been underpinned by strong financial results for both the fourth quarter (Q4) and full fiscal year 2024 (FY2024). Key highlights includes revenue growth in Q4 reaching $48.39 billion, a 21% increase year-over-year, while FY2024 revenue totaled $164.50 billion, up 22% from the previous year.  Ôøº


Q4 net income was $20.84 billion, a 49% increase compared to the same period last year. For FY2024, net income stood at $62.36 billion, marking a 59% increase.  Ôøº
Q4 diluted EPS was $8.02, up 50% year-over-year.
The annual EPS for FY2024 was $23.86, reflecting a 60% surge.  Ôøº


CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed this growth to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) glasses, and the evolution of social media platforms. He expressed enthusiasm for scaling these efforts further in 2025.  Ôøº


Looking ahead, Meta anticipates Q1 2025 revenue between $39.5 billion and $41.8 billion, representing 8-15% year-over-year growth. The company also projects full-year 2025 expenses to range from $114 billion to $119 billion, primarily driven by infrastructure investments and employee compensation in key areas such as AI and Reality Labs.  Ôøº


Despite the potential end to the current stock rally, Meta‚Äôs strong financial performance and strategic investments position the company for continued growth-- last but not least, despite the end of its winning streak... the stock is still up a f**king 18% YEAR-TO-DATE.

My analysis:

Earnings were reported on January 29, the 8th day of this streak. They did beat expectations, and beat by a lot. However, CONSECUTIVE multi-day post-earnings streaks historically don‚Äôt tend to last, since all information is now public, and some investors choose to take profits. We‚Äôre not talking about a post-earnings uptrend that lasts for weeks/months, but CONSECUTIVE GREEN days reacting to the SAME earnings release, with no further news. (Today‚Äôs layoffs were also announced weeks ago.)

The other peculiar thing about this stock is it follows a similar chart pattern each day. It tends to rocket up first thing in the morning, followed by a steady mid-day/early afternoon selloff that takes it back to flat or even slightly negative. Then it gets bid up again in the last few hours for a positive close.

[Look at the huge daily morning spikes!](https://preview.redd.it/g0ojl4oodeie1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1038843bea03b4f66c02c66ae3599bb9a17312c2)

1iickrt_META,META,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026.

I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income).  
  
Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony.

The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting).

The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve. In fact it will probably get worse. I can see Google tripling profits between now and 2030 while the p/e is cut in half, tbh

 
Imagine telling a Google bear on the eve of November 2022 after the release of ChatGPT that Google will make 100b in net income in 2024. They'd laugh in your face - search will be obsolete by then. The jury is out on this one, generative AI is not taking marker share and not causing a growth slowdown.

We've been asking this question for almost 3 years now, the answer has remained the same, yet bears keep on thinking that will change. When do you bears lose credibility? We've been hearing about the demise of Search for almost 30 months. At what point do you just admit that you're wrong and realize that LLM is orthogonal to search?
what are peoples thoughts?

""google will never have half the PE of now, it cannot trade at average SPY PE, it has too much moat to be valued like any other SPY company""

Yet look at the facts today:

Current p/e ratio of the SPY: 27.71
current p/e ratio of GOOG: 21 - so google already trades at a STEEP discount to the market. I'm looking at the P/E chart and it seems that the discount is poised to just get worse over time? Pull up the chart of GOOG P/E over time, its in terminal decline for years now. It started the decade around ~30, halfway through the decade in 2025 its at ~21, it will be 10-15 by end of the decade at this rate

why is GOOG considered ""magnificent"" (the market thinks the business is lackluster considering the steep discount it trades at)? ",2025-02-05,944,400
1iickrt_GOOGL,GOOGL,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026.

I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income).  
  
Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony.

The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting).

The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve.

1. New recognition from CES 2025, Wearable Devices Ltd. won an honoree award at CES 2025 as a consumer electronic tech. They showcased how adaptive and responsive their Mudra band is and how machine learning and AI pick up an individual's EGM in their wrist to seamlessly display on a screen interactions like playing games, swiping on socials, or browsing the web. ALL from thin air. This gained wide exposure and surely will result in sales... but how many is still to be known. Google trends shows a heavy increase in search for their key products. (see images)
2. They just started shipping to customers literally right now at the end of January 2025. This will result in (again) increased sales now that pre-orders are being filled and advertised marketing has begun.
3. They finished 2 public offerings, this to me seems like a good sign for a company with a decent amount of debt, they already finished 2 public offerings in the span of just 2 months. It's possible they have another offering but if they make even decent sales they likely won't. The public offerings would have likely satisfied their NASDAQ minimum requirement for $2.5m stockholder equity as well.
4. Working closely with RayNeo owned by TCL (a $54b networth company) and are going to be partnering for the upcoming RayNeo X3 Pro AR glasses which are set to be released mid-2025. If TCL puts their marketing towards this product in collaboration with Mudra Link.... We're going to see BIG numbers as RayNeo is a leading pioneer right now in AR glasses. This btw allows users to use both AR glasses and their Mudra Link to have a truly augmented and device-less experience that hasn't been seen before.
5. This is AR space is being taken VERY seriously by big tech like Apple and Meta... And the craziest thing is Wearable Devices is literally beating these guys to the punch, these products are coming this YEAR. Meta Orion isn't expected until late 2027 and that's just an estimate. Apple Vision is also thousands of dollars, this AR experience with RayNeo and Mudra Link will be far less expensive allowing a broader portion of consumers to enjoy them.

Now for the chart, they lost a lot of steam recently because of the 2 public offerings and also a NASDAQ minimum requirement notification. Not to mention the lengthy wait for them to officially sell their Mudra Link, personally for me I would keep an eye on this stock, it has had downward pressure. I would DCA a small amount once I start to see the price bottom out and a breakout begin, happy investing.

1id12af_META,META,Is anyone playing META for earnings today?,"Zuckerberg's earnings are today. Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off. 

Unfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.

Despite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.

But the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions. 

Meta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union‚Äôs Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok's impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry.

1iam3ap_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn‚Äôt get too far either. But Apple‚Äôs vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car‚Äôs capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple‚Äôs work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream ‚Äî a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day ‚Äî was still far off.

>That‚Äôs about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren‚Äôt truly seeing the real world around them, but the device‚Äôs pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device ‚Äî all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don‚Äôt have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it‚Äôs hard to discount Apple‚Äôs innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company‚Äôs home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year ‚Äî when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays ‚Äî the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don‚Äôt think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS ‚Äî the Vision Pro‚Äôs software ‚Äî that will run on glasses. It‚Äôs also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple‚Äôs rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta‚Äôs AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google‚Äôs new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google‚Äôs headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes ‚Äî with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won‚Äôt hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren‚Äôt slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I‚Äôm told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its ‚ÄúMoohan‚Äù mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it‚Äôs on track to debut this year. The companies won‚Äôt have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops ‚Äî markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what‚Äôs at stake, Apple can‚Äôt afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

# Tesla Debuts New Model Y in US, Europe in Bid to Revive Sales

Tesla is hitting the reset button on its best-selling Model Y, debuting a revamped version in the U.S. and Europe with hopes of reversing its first annual sales drop in over a decade. The refresh brings updates like Cybertruck-inspired light bars, soundproofed interiors, and a range of 320 miles.

**What‚Äôs New Under the Hood?**  
  
The ""Juniper"" Model Y comes with fresh aesthetics, tech upgrades like rear-seat touchscreens, and faster Wi-Fi, but it‚Äôs not just a facelift. The refreshed SUV now touts a zippier 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds, giving it a slight edge in performance. While the base model remains, the ‚ÄúLaunch Series‚Äù version‚Äîpacked with features like Full Self-Driving‚Äîis Tesla‚Äôs bold bet to woo customers willing to shell out extra for cutting-edge convenience.

**A Pricey Predicament**  
  
The updated price tag, roughly $4,000 more than its predecessor, might be a tough sell. With EV demand cooling and higher interest rates pinching consumer wallets, Tesla‚Äôs bet on premium features will test whether its loyal fanbase will dig deeper into their pockets. Add in the looming repeal of federal EV tax credits under Trump‚Äôs new administration, and the stakes for the Model Y refresh couldn‚Äôt be higher.  
  
Tesla‚Äôs upcoming earnings report will reveal whether this redesign can jumpstart sales. Investors will also be on the lookout for updates on the long-rumored ‚ÄúModel 2,‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs anticipated budget-friendly EV. With Musk targeting sales growth of 20‚Äì30% in 2025, all roads seem to lead to more affordable options for expanding the EV giant's reach.

**The Bigger Picture:**¬†Tesla‚Äôs refresh is as much about optics as it is about specs. The EV pioneer faces mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers leaning into the EV space. Whether the new Model Y can fend off rivals and keep Tesla‚Äôs dominance alive will hinge on its ability to balance innovation with affordability‚Äîa feat easier said than done.

For now, the Model Y refresh signals that Tesla isn‚Äôt just coasting; it‚Äôs steering into the future, albeit at a premium price.

# Meta's $65 Billion AI Bet: Zuckerberg Goes All-In

Mark Zuckerberg is putting Meta‚Äôs chips‚Äîactually, 1.3 million GPUs worth‚Äîon artificial intelligence, with plans to invest up to $65 billion in 2025. This spending spree includes a Manhattan-sized data center, a hiring boost for AI teams, and enough computing power to make the sci-fi nerds blush. The tech giant isn‚Äôt just flexing; it‚Äôs making a play to dominate the next era of innovation.

**A Data Center the Size of Ambition**  
  
Meta‚Äôs new Louisiana data center is so massive it could ""cover a significant part of Manhattan,"" according to Zuckerberg. With a gigawatt of computing power set to come online next year, Meta is preparing to turbocharge its AI capabilities. The timing aligns with a broader arms race among tech titans, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet also throwing billions at AI infrastructure.

**Can AI Investments Keep Investors Happy?**  
  
While Wall Street had expected Meta to spend around $51 billion on capex in 2025, the additional $14 billion caught some off guard. Yet, analysts see the move as bold but potentially brilliant, arguing it positions Meta to lead in AI innovation. Shares initially dipped but recovered, with the stock closing at an all-time high of $647.49 on Friday.

**The Bigger Picture**  
  
Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt shy about the risks. He‚Äôs acknowledged the possibility of overbuilding but believes missing out on AI would be a bigger blunder. ""The downside of being behind is that you‚Äôre out of position for the next 10‚Äì15 years,"" he said. With a track record of making high-stakes bets that pay off (hello, Instagram acquisition), the gamble could redefine how Meta operates‚Äîand how we interact with technology.

**What‚Äôs Next?**¬†As Meta gears up for its Q4 earnings on Jan. 29, investors will be looking for more details on these grandiose AI plans. If Zuckerberg‚Äôs bets pay off, Meta might not just own the metaverse‚Äîit could be the backbone of tomorrow‚Äôs AI-driven economy.

What‚Äôs the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn‚Äôt post financial news by itself since they are ‚Äúlow effort posts‚Äù, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared.

But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are ‚Äújust buy index funds‚Äù regardless of what the questions are.

Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive ‚Äúyou have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO‚Äù or no response at all. 

So we can‚Äôt post financial news by themselves, and this isn‚Äôt the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to ‚Äúbuy index funds‚Äù.

Btw mods, I understand that you guys don‚Äôt want ‚Äúlow-effort posts‚Äù, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it‚Äôs ok to leave it up? It‚Äôs not like the front page is full anyway. It‚Äôs frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. 

Edit: Honestly I‚Äôll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I‚Äôm not sure the mods are willing to spend time on.

I‚Äôve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers.

# Meta to Cut Roughly 5% of Staff, Targeting Lowest Performers

In a move that feels like d√©j√† vu, Meta announced it‚Äôs cutting about 5% of its workforce‚Äîor around 3,600 jobs‚Äîby February. But this round of cuts isn‚Äôt about reducing costs‚Äîit‚Äôs about raising the performance bar. In a memo to employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to ‚Äúmove out low performers faster‚Äù and focus on assembling the best talent as Meta gears up for an ‚Äúintense year‚Äù of building in AI, smart glasses, and the future of social media.

**A Balancing Act**

While some roles are being slashed, new ones are being created. Meta plans to backfill these positions later this year, signaling that the company is doubling down on key growth areas. However, Wall Street didn‚Äôt exactly cheer‚Äîshares fell more than 2% after the announcement.

The memo also comes on the heels of other major changes, including the end of Meta‚Äôs fact-checking program and a rollback of diversity efforts, moves that some see as attempts to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration.

**Raising Eyebrows**

Zuckerberg‚Äôs efficiency push has sparked internal debate, with some employees questioning whether these cuts disproportionately affect underrepresented groups‚Äîespecially after recent comments about fostering more ""masculine energy"" in corporate culture. And while Meta says the focus is on boosting performance, critics argue the policy shifts could further erode trust among its workforce, particularly in areas tied to inclusion and oversight.

**The Bigger Picture**

Zuckerberg‚Äôs focus on efficiency isn‚Äôt new‚Äîhe dubbed 2023 as Meta‚Äôs ""year of efficiency"" and cut over 20,000 roles across the company. Now, he‚Äôs positioning Meta to stay competitive as it pivots toward AI-led growth. But this time, the cuts have reignited concerns about whether Meta can pull off this balancing act without losing its edge‚Äîor its people.

# Intel to Turn Venture Arm Into Separate Firm With New Name

Intel is spinning off its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, into an independent investment fund, aiming to inject new energy (and new money) into its operations. Intel, which will stay on as an anchor investor, says the standalone fund will start operating under a new name in the second half of 2025, boasting over $5 billion in assets under management.

The move is all about flexibility. By stepping out of Intel‚Äôs shadow, Intel Capital can raise funds from external backers while continuing to make strategic bets on innovative startups. The current Intel Capital team will transition to the new entity, and day-to-day operations will carry on without interruption. Interim co-CEO David Zinsner called the split a ""win-win"" that unlocks new capital while keeping Intel‚Äôs strategic partnership intact.

**A Legacy of Bold Bets**

Intel Capital, established in 1991, was a pioneer in corporate venture capital. Over the years, it has invested more than $20 billion in over 1,800 companies, with a portfolio spanning AI, cloud, 5G, and robotics. Its big-name bets include AI chipmaker SambaNova and robotics firm Figure, proving that it knows how to pick winners in the tech game.

But this spinoff isn‚Äôt happening in a vacuum. Intel has faced significant headwinds, reporting a record $16.6 billion quarterly loss last year‚Äîthe largest in its history. To turn things around, the company launched a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that included shedding 15,000 jobs and spinning off other divisions like its FPGA business, Altera.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Intel Capital‚Äôs newfound independence mirrors similar moves in Silicon Valley (think SAP‚Äôs Sapphire Ventures), it underscores Intel‚Äôs broader effort to regain its footing amid fierce competition. As Nvidia and AMD dominate the chip scene, Intel‚Äôs restructuring is a bet on long-term survival and reinvention.

For Intel Capital, this next chapter presents an opportunity to expand its venture portfolio while navigating the complex landscape of global tech. Meanwhile, Intel‚Äôs future depends on whether it can turn its renewed focus on cutting-edge chipmaking into a comeback story worth watching.

1i1c1op_META,META,Meta announces 5% cuts in preparation for 'intense year' ‚Äî Read the internal memo,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company‚Äôs lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to ‚Äúmove out low performers faster‚Äù in a memo posted on the company‚Äôs internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will ‚Äúbe an intense year.‚Äù

The company specified that it is ‚Äúexiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers‚Äù in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta‚Äôs largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a ‚ÄúCommunity Notes‚Äù model used on Elon Musk‚Äôs platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

‚ÄúThe recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we‚Äôre going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,‚Äù Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg‚Äôs internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I‚Äôve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren‚Äôt meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we‚Äôre going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won‚Äôt manage out everyone who didn‚Äôt meet expectations for the last period if we‚Äôre optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we‚Äôll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We‚Äôll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

¬•\~Previous Events  
  
=They posted beautiful numbers during earnings but Mark started talking about bad AI numbers and the market panicked a bit.   
=The market was digesting Meta's insane comeback anyway. They need something big to impress outside of expected large ad numbers.   
= 3-0 unanimous decision by an appeals court decision to uphold Tiktok ban in December 
  
¬•\~Present   
  
What about if one of their competitors vanishes overnight? We are playing the TikTok ban. This canon event is being heavily discounted.  
  
It's down to nine people after that it cannot be changed. Trump submitted the amicus brief as this will be the last chance he could stop the ban without getting into some serious issues with his chosen board and Congress with both sides supporting the bill. With everything else that's on his plate, I believe Trump will call a spade a spade and will look into it and say he tried. He's already got the election win from Tiktok he doesn't need it as much and with Zuck now onside he can still push what he needs to push. The moves.   
  
This is down to nine people and how they see national security. I've read up on the defense and prosecution legal appeals from before the original appeals trial (160 pages) and the US DOJ has an incredibly strong case, which is why the appeals court voted 3-0.   
  
Each judge has a different view on amendments and their importance vs national security however we can base from the previous judges arguments that this is quite open and shut as three judges reached the same conclusion with two judges differing on the interpretation but arriving at the same conclusion.  
  
If this goes through...it will get bigger than the initial 10% gain with the appeals decision. It will create a rally at which point there'll be many spots to take profit. The longer this ban stays in place the more of a rally Meta will gain (Snapchat, Google, possibly Reddit, too) but we bet on the big horse first.  
  
The ad dollars on offer are gonna get carved up like a prize beast and these ad companies are going to add the spoils to their market cap.  
  
Here are my estimates for possible results based on everything with 5-4 enough to uphold the ban.  
  
5-4 Stay/Strike down  
5-4 Uphold   
6-3 Uphold   
7-2 Uphold  
  
My prediction: 6-3 Uphold   
  
¬•\~Future - Guidance/Event  
  
Facebook delivered great numbers and good guidance except for AI comments. However, this quarter they'll be carving up a big slice of the ad pie.   
  
Creatives: So quick admission I used to work in social advertising years ago and the creatives as they are known are the images and videos used for a digital advert and they come locked into certain aspect ratios and formats. This means companies that have locked in months of creatives from agencies will have to move their TikTok ads somewhere the format works. Snap, Google, and of course Meta (Big Horse)  
  
Facebook's ad budget: Is going to swell and we all know that the catalyst will be continuing the rally when they announce earnings in Early February.

1hvrk2d_META,META,"Meta scraps fact checking program, is bringing back political content","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html

Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to ‚Äúrestore free expression‚Äù and move to a ‚ÄúCommunity Notes‚Äù model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk‚Äôs platform X.

The company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta‚Äôs latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve reached a point where it‚Äôs just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,‚Äù Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. ‚ÄúThe recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we‚Äôre going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.‚Äù

Zuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been ‚Äútoo politically biased‚Äù and have ‚Äúdestroyed more trust than they‚Äôve created, especially in the U.S.‚Äù

Meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.

Joel Kaplan, Meta‚Äôs head of global policy, appeared on ‚ÄúFox and Friends‚Äù Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk‚Äôs platform X has been working ‚Äúreally well.‚Äù Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.

Last week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company‚Äôs top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain‚Äôs centrist Liberal Democrats party.

Kaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

In December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.

‚ÄúWe want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,‚Äù Kaplan said Tuesday.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to ‚Äúunderstand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.‚Äù

Zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump‚Äôs Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president‚Äôs actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.

In 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company‚Äôs community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump‚Äôs account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to¬†Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

‚ÄúEntergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,‚Äù wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to¬†*Barron‚Äôs*.¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a monumental deal for the sector.‚Äù

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told¬†*Barron‚Äôs*¬†the Louisiana data center ‚Äúwill be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.‚Äù

The company didn‚Äôt say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance ‚Äúenough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,‚Äù she wrote in an email.

But it isn‚Äôt clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn‚Äôt be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing¬†heavily in artificial intelligence¬†and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn‚Äôt look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will ‚Äúcontinue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.‚Äù

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta‚Äôs decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court.¬†

A federal judge ruled that the FTC‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape.¬†

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.

Next week‚Äôs shaping up to be all about housing, with the home builder confidence index kicking things off Monday, housing starts dropping Tuesday, and existing home sales wrapping it up Thursday.

1. Double down on META call: like deep ITM call expiring Feb, Mar 25. In Zuck I believe it will recover back to 590-600 range in few months.

2. CUt the loss now and accept it.

We have recently noticed an increase in the number of posts that are requesting advice about portfolio allocations, next steps, etc. These posts tend to see decent engagement with helpful comments. On the other hand, we see that some users are complaining about these posts. The intent of this post is to collect community feedback on the ""Belongs in portfolio thread"" rule to better understand how the users of this subreddit would like to see this rule enforced. 

Despite being a fairly large sub, this sub has somewhat low user activity and post engagement. We are attempting to balance post volume with post quality. The mods of this subreddit have discussed this rule internally on multiple occasions. We would like to open the discussion up to the community to collect your thoughts. 

Would you like the mods to:

1. Remove the ""Belongs in Portfolio Thread"" rule and the stickied portfolio review thread
2. Remove low-effort portfolio review posts (e.g. image-only posts, allocation-only posts, etc.). Users are required to provide a minimum level of commentary explaining their portfolio allocation and strategy to help guide constructive answers.
3. Strictly enforce the portfolio review rule on any related posts. We're not here to review other people's portfolios.

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet‚Äôs favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year‚Äôs $7.4 million loss.¬†

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March‚Äîa huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What‚Äôs fueling Reddit‚Äôs rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit‚Äôs huge traffic into ad dollars.¬†

Meanwhile, Reddit‚Äôs data has become gold in the AI world‚ÄîGoogle and OpenAI now license Reddit‚Äôs data to train their AI models, helping drive ‚Äúother revenue‚Äù up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit‚Äôs user base is growing, too.¬†

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit‚Äôs new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts.¬†

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet‚Äôs quirky corner‚Äîit‚Äôs a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit‚Äôs steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media.¬†

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that‚Äôs no small feat.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* üíª¬†**Microsoft**¬†shares ticked down 3.60% post-earnings after reporting Q3 revenue of $65.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street's $64.5 billion estimate. Profits also beat, coming in at $3.30 per share. AI contributed 12 points to Azure‚Äôs 34% growth, though data center limitations held back further gains. Meanwhile, rising AI-driven demand in its Office products and Bing boosted search ad revenue by 19% ($MSFT). 
* üì±**Meta**¬†shares slipped slightly 3.06% after Q3 results showed $40.6 billion in revenue, a 19% increase year-over-year, beating Wall Street‚Äôs $40.3 billion target. Reality Labs, Meta‚Äôs AI and augmented reality arm, reported a $4.4 billion loss, as Zuckerberg aims to keep AI investments rolling. The company‚Äôs ad-targeting improvements, however, bolstered engagement, even as Wall Street questions the returns on its AI and AR bets ($META). 
* üíä¬†**Eli Lilly**¬†dropped 6.28% after its weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro came up $900 million short of expectations, attributed to inventory issues. Q3 revenue was $11.4 billion, below analysts‚Äô $12.2 billion projection, and full-year guidance was cut by $600 million. Despite supply-chain fixes, analysts worry about demand as compounded drugs gain ground, posing a potential risk to Lilly‚Äôs future sales ($LLY). 
* ‚òï¬†**Starbucks**¬†is undergoing a major strategy shift under new CEO Brian Niccol, who aims to reverse a 7% drop in Q4 same-store sales. Shares are up slightly since his hire, but challenges remain as Niccol plans to simplify Starbucks‚Äô menu and refine mobile ordering. Investors await insights on how Niccol will drive growth in key markets, especially China, where the chain faces a tough competitive landscape ($SBUX). 
* üìâ¬†**Robinhood**¬†sank 11.38% in after-hours after Q3 net revenue of $637 million fell below the expected $663.5 million. A costly customer promotion, which offset revenue by $27 million, impacted the bottom line despite robust user growth in new products like crypto and futures trading. The company aims to attract more mature investors with recent expansions but faces challenges in turning promotional spending into sustainable revenue ($HOOD).

# Tomorrow

PCE is the inflation metric everyone‚Äôs watching‚Äîespecially the Fed. Core PCE, the central bank‚Äôs go-to gauge, could tip the scales toward rate cuts if tomorrow‚Äôs reading stays low. All eyes will be on the data as it rolls in.

Initial jobless claims offer a weekly pulse on the labor market, though recent hurricanes might muddy the numbers a bit. Thankfully, the latest figures have held steady, keeping any labor market jitters at bay..

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox**¬†took a beating in late September after a harsh report from short-seller Hindenburg Research. If the company manages to counter these claims, it could become a prime buying opportunity, given its rapid growth, strong cash reserves, and a young, expanding user base. Analysts expect a -$0.39 EPS on $1.02 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Apple**¬†has slightly underperformed the market as investors fret over growth, especially in iPhone 16 sales. With demand dipping in China‚Äôs sluggish economy, Apple is ramping up its game with new AI software and fresh Mac hardware. CEO Tim Cook will be looking to reassure shareholders with a solid plan for future growth. Consensus: $1.60 EPS, $94.41 billion in revenue. ($AAPL)¬†
* **Amazon**¬†still rules online retail, but all eyes are on its cloud segment, AWS, now a major revenue machine. With heavy investments in AI, AWS is primed for growth, though costs are a concern. Investors will be watching for signs that CEO Andy Jassy‚Äôs investments are paying off, especially as consumer spending slows. Consensus: $1.14 EPS, $157.14 billion in revenue.

# Day Trader Turns $306M into Nothing, Sues for Negligence

Classic day-trader tale: a guy, some cash, and Tesla options. For Vancouver Island carpenter Christopher DeVocht, it turned into one of the wildest rides in day-trading history.

By late 2019, DeVocht‚Äôs trading account with RBC Dominion Securities sat at C$88,000. Fast forward two years‚Äîit ballooned to C$415 million ($306 million). Riding high on Tesla options, DeVocht seemed unstoppable. But instead of cashing out, he doubled down, betting everything on Tesla's continued rise. Then came 2022. Tesla‚Äôs stock took a nosedive, and with it, DeVocht‚Äôs massive fortune disappeared‚Äîfrom $306 million to nothing.

Now, DeVocht is suing RBC and accounting firm Grant Thornton for what he calls ""negligent advice."" He claims the guidance he received‚Äîfocused on minimizing taxes‚Äîdidn‚Äôt account for his limited financial know-how. Instead of taking profits, he was advised to concentrate his holdings in Tesla and get tax breaks by forming an investment holding company, leading to disastrous overexposure.

As Tesla‚Äôs stock plunged, DeVocht borrowed millions from a margin account to stay afloat, hoping to recover his losses. He even borrowed C$20 million for shorter-term trades, but that didn‚Äôt work out either. Eventually, the corporation had to sell all Tesla holdings to repay loans, leaving DeVocht empty-handed.

DeVocht insists that with better advice, he wouldn‚Äôt have lost everything. He claims RBC wrongly treated him as a sophisticated investor, and now he‚Äôs seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. He‚Äôs also blaming a recommendation to donate C$25.5 million to charity for adding to his financial woes.

Royal Bank hasn‚Äôt commented, and Grant Thornton says they‚Äôre sticking to professional standards‚Äîwhatever that means in this mess. For now, DeVocht‚Äôs story is a cautionary tale of what happens when day traders get in over their heads without a safety net.

# College students used Meta‚Äôs smart glasses to dox people in real time

Picture this: You‚Äôre on the subway, minding your business, and suddenly someone knows your name, job, and where you live‚Äîall thanks to a pair of smart glasses. Sounds like sci-fi? Not anymore. Two Harvard students recently turned Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban glasses into a real-life doxxing device, and it‚Äôs raising major privacy red flags.

AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio used Meta‚Äôs glasses paired with the facial recognition tool PimEyes to scan strangers and gather personal info, like addresses and job details. In their demo, they even used the data to strike up conversations with unsuspecting people. The glasses streamed video to a laptop, where the real magic‚Äîand invasion of privacy‚Äîhappened. Meta was quick to point out that this wasn‚Äôt built-in tech; it was a hack using publicly available tools. But the glasses‚Äô hands-free, inconspicuous design makes this kind of invasion way too easy.

Big picture: Back in 2021, Meta execs‚Äîincluding current CTO Andrew Bosworth‚Äîactually considered adding facial recognition to these glasses, thinking it could help you remember someone‚Äôs name at a party. The idea got scrapped, probably because of the massive ethical and legal issues. But wearable tech is catching on, and attitudes are shifting. Meta has already sold over 700,000 pairs of these glasses in the last year, despite privacy concerns.

What‚Äôs next? Are we on the path to accepting facial recognition in our everyday tech, or is this a step too far? With smart glasses blending into everyday fashion, it‚Äôs getting harder to tell when you‚Äôre being recorded‚Äîand that‚Äôs what makes this debate so urgent.

The potential for misuse is clear. Imagine someone using these glasses not just for fun, but for malicious purposes‚Äîstalking, harassment, or worse. It‚Äôs a fine line between convenience and invasion, and the ease of combining wearable tech with facial recognition makes it all the more dangerous. While some people might welcome the idea of recognizing acquaintances in public, the risks far outweigh the benefits for many.

Tech companies like Meta must tread carefully. Privacy laws in places like Illinois, Texas, and the European Union already restrict certain uses of facial recognition, but technology often moves faster than regulation. For now, the responsibility falls on both companies and consumers to use these powerful tools ethically‚Äîand to push back when the line between helpful and harmful gets crossed.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

After a calm stretch, get ready for a packed week. The big headline? Thursday‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will serve as a key gauge for inflation and the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight to bring prices down. If inflation shows signs of cooling, expect markets to cheer. But if the report disappoints, more volatility could be on the horizon.

Before that, Tuesday kicks off with the NFIB optimism index, giving insight into small business sentiment‚Äîa vital metric since small businesses make up nearly half of U.S. GDP. Then, on Wednesday, we‚Äôll get a look at wholesale inventories, a key factor for understanding the pace of manufacturing and GDP growth.

Thursday isn‚Äôt just about CPI‚Äîweekly jobless claims will also roll in, giving an update on the labor market. And to finish the week strong, Friday‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide an early look at inflation from the perspective of manufacturers, followed by earnings reports from JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, signaling the start of a new earnings season.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, we‚Äôll also hear from nine Federal Reserve officials throughout the week. Wall Street will be analyzing their every word for hints of what‚Äôs to come in monetary policy.

1ejzv3k_META,META,My thoughts on META,"**I'd like to start a dialogue on what investors think about META - please challenge or add onto this discussion. This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).

**META specific thoughts:**

* **Earnings:**
   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).
* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**
   * Currently trading at \~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.
   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.
* **Long term bets:**
   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.
   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the ""small business or personal"" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.
   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)
* **Spending Risks:**
   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.
   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).
* **Economic Risks:**
   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions
   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away
   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.

**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors.",2024-08-04,53,45

**Winners & Losers**

**What‚Äôs up üìà**

Match Group ($MTCH) skyrocketed 13.21% after revealing plans to cut headcount to offset declining subscriber numbers.

Arista Networks ($ANET) jumped 11.32% on strong demand from AI users for its data centers.

AutoNation ($AN) surged 6.30% as the company reported impressive growth despite a major cyberattack on its car dealerships earlier this year.

DuPont ($DD) climbed 4.10% with investors optimistic about the chemical company‚Äôs ongoing turnaround efforts.

Starbucks ($SBUX) edged up 2.65%, as shareholders focused on optimistic business forecasts rather than missed sales expectations.

Boeing ($BA) gained 2% in a surprising move after weak earnings, with investors showing confidence in the new CEO, Robert Ortberg.



**What‚Äôs down üìâ**

Pinterest ($PINS) plummeted 14.46% following disappointing guidance for the third quarter.

Humana ($HUM) plunged 10.60% despite beating earnings expectations, as investors focused on rising medical expense ratios.

Marriott International ($MAR) dropped 4.80% after missing analyst forecasts and guiding for lower profits in the next quarter.

Skyworks Solutions ($SWKS) slipped 3.46% as the semiconductor company reported declining demand for its automotive chips.

Altria Group ($MO) declined 3.09% after falling short of analyst expectations and narrowing its forward guidance due to lower cigarette sales.

Microsoft ($MSFT) dipped 1.08% as earnings revealed the extended timeline needed for its AI investments to pay off.

  
**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**



Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed‚Äôs July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September‚Äîif the data plays nice. While Powell didn‚Äôt drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here‚Äôs the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a ‚Äúnice conversation‚Äù about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn‚Äôt likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a ‚Äúvery difficult judgment call,‚Äù outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn‚Äôt fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell‚Äôs remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he‚Äôs still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year‚Äôs end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed‚Äôs dual mandate‚Äîcurbing inflation while keeping employment high‚Äîrequires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed‚Äôs next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they‚Äôre the key ingredients for what happens in September.

  
**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what‚Äôs driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it‚Äôs going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business‚Äîdigital advertising‚Äîcontinues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That‚Äôs more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He‚Äôs not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta‚Äôs open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta‚Äôs bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta‚Äôs operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company‚Äôs cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We‚Äôre still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there‚Äôs still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it‚Äôs in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren‚Äôt feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a ‚Äúsell.‚Äù Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

1egx2zd_META,META,"Meta shares pop on revenue and earnings beat, better than expected forecast","Meta shares jumped about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street estimates for revenue and profit and issued a better-than-expected forecast for the current period.

Here are the results:

Earnings: $5.16 a share vs. $4.73 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Meta provided revenue guidance for the third quarter between the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Analysts were expecting third-quarter sales guidance of $39.1 billion.

The social networking giant reported second-quarter revenue growth of 22% from $32 billion a year earlier, marking a fourth straight quarter of growth in excess of 20%.

Meta said that expenses in the second quarter was $24.2 billion, and that these expenses include the charge from Meta‚Äôs recent agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas for $1.4 billion.

The company reported capital expenditures of $8.47 billion for the second quarter, which was lower than the $9.51 billion that analysts estimated.

Regarding Meta‚Äôs outlook for expenses, the company said that total expenses for the year remain unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion. Capital expenditures are up from the low range to $37 billion to $40 billion compared to $35 billion to $40 billion.

1egxcvb_META,META,"Meta shares pop on revenue and earnings beat, better than expected forecast","Meta shares soared approximately 7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday following the company‚Äôs announcement that it surpassed Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. The social media giant also issued an upbeat forecast for the current period, further boosting investor confidence.

Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, continues to pour significant resources into artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR), key areas of focus for the company as it looks to maintain its competitive edge and drive future growth.

The Numbers:
Earnings per share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Q3 revenue guidance: $38.5 billion to $41 billion vs. $39.1 billion expected

Q2 revenue growth: 22% year-over-year, rising from $32 billion to $39.07 billion

Expenses: $24.2 billion in Q2, including a $1.4 billion charge from a facial recognition data lawsuit settlement in Texas

Capital expenditures: $8.47 billion in Q2, lower than the $9.51 billion expected

Full-year expense outlook: Unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion

Capital expenditures forecast: Increased to $37 billion to $40 billion from a previous range of $35 billion to $40 billion

Daily active people (DAP): 3.27 billion, in line with estimates

Headcount: Down 1% year-over-year to 70,799 as of June 30, 2024

Key Highlights:
Meta‚Äôs second-quarter revenue showed a robust 22% increase compared to the same period last year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter with revenue growth exceeding 20%. This impressive growth comes as Meta ramps up its investments in AI and VR, which are increasingly seen as critical to the company‚Äôs long-term strategy.

The company‚Äôs expenses for the second quarter totaled $24.2 billion, partly due to a substantial $1.4 billion charge related to a facial recognition data lawsuit settlement in Texas. Despite these expenses, Meta's capital expenditures came in lower than expected at $8.47 billion, compared to the $9.51 billion analysts had anticipated.

Looking ahead, Meta provided a revenue guidance range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion for the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations of $39.1 billion. However, the company slightly adjusted its capital expenditures outlook upward to a range of $37 billion to $40 billion for the year.

In terms of user metrics, Meta reported 3.27 billion daily active people (DAP) across its family of apps, which was in line with StreetAccount estimates. The company‚Äôs headcount saw a slight decline, down 1% year-over-year to 70,799 as of June 30, 2024.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence in Meta‚Äôs AI initiatives, stating, ""We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year. We've released the first frontier-level open-source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.""

Overall, Meta‚Äôs strong financial performance and positive outlook suggest that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory, even as it navigates significant investments in new technologies and ongoing regulatory challenges.

1eca49y_GOOGL,GOOGL,I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:

I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.

The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.

Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.

In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.

I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice 

Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)

EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:

1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.

2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.

3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.

There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.

1dsqkd7_META,META,Meta accused of breaching EU antitrust rules over ad-supported subscription service ,"Facebook parent company Meta was on Monday accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc‚Äôs landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service.

The Commission labelled the ad-supported subscription option a ‚Äúpay or consent‚Äù model ‚Äî which means users have to either pay to use Meta‚Äôs platforms ad-free, or consent to their data being processed for personalized advertising. The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year.

‚ÄúIn the Commission‚Äôs preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta‚Äôs social networks,‚Äù regulators said in a statement Monday.

CNBC has reached out to Meta for comment. The company separately told Reuters in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model ‚Äúfollows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA.‚Äù

Meta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU‚Äôs top court, last year that a company may offer an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer.

1cchrf6_META,META,Meta's Reality Labs posts $3.85 billion loss in first quarter,"Meta shows no signs of substantially trimming its losses from investing in the metaverse, as competition heightens between the Facebook parent and Apple in the virtual reality market.

In its first-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Meta disclosed that its Reality Labs unit recorded a $3.85 billion operating loss. Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Meta‚Äôs total sales for the quarter.

Analysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.

Reality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse ‚Äúthe next frontier,‚Äù imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.

For now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.

The company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called ‚Äúspatial computing‚Äù experience.

Meta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple ‚Äúbasically won out‚Äù in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Meta‚Äôs move aims to ensure the ‚Äúopen model defines the next generation of computing.‚Äù

Meta said it expects revenue in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of the range, $37.75 billion, would represent 18% year-over-year growth and is below analysts‚Äô average estimate of $38.3 billion.

1bqq2iz_META,META,"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL","I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

In last year‚Äôs wave of generative AI, Nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. Predictably, AI applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants.

**Meta plans to launch a new AI chip, Artemisintelligence**ial intelligence gold rush, the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. To support the artificial intelligence business, Meta (META) plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year, and Meta plans to launch Artemis of AI chips for model reasoning this year, to reduce its reliance on Nvidia chips.

Meta h,as been improving its computing power to meet generative AI products in applications such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as hardware devices such as Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs flagship H100 processors by the end of the year, and with other suppliers, Meta will have 600,000 H100 equivalent computing power.

**AMD / Microsoft makes a full preparation for AI chips**

In addition, US chip giant AMD (AMD) recently raised its 2024 AI processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. AMD CEO Zifeng Su said on the conference call that its AI chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year.

Microsoft (MSFT), which is betting on AI, has also launched its first AI chip, Maia 100, to compete with Nvidia‚Äôs GPU and reduce its expensive reliance on Nvidia. Maia 100 Using the 5nm process, the number of transistors reaches 105 billion, which can be used for large language model training and reasoning.

The two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. Both custom chips power Microsoft‚Äôs Azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. Nadella said Maia will first support Microsoft‚Äôs own AI applications and then to partners and customers.

There is no doubt that demand for AI chips is extremely strong, and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the Nvidia H100. According to the latest forecast from market research firm Gartner, the AI chip market will grow 25.6% from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. Gartner The AI chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027, reaching $119.4 billion.

**WiMi explores the value from the industrial chain**

Definitely, the outlook for AI chip demand is extremely promising. Data shows, as a leading AI vision enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) under the boom of artificial intelligence, currently in semiconductor, algorithm and holographic AR light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength, and has developed its AI chip business, to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business.

At present, the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given WiMi a new role. WiMi based on AI chip is no longer limited to command control, but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis, which requires CPU and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of AI applications. At the same time, with the deepening of the industry, WiMiAI chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. In terms of horizontal development, AI vision is promoted to intelligent home, commercial buildings, intelligent security, intelligent retail, autonomous driving, robots and other broader application scenarios.

No doubt, 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth, and AI, electrification, energy transition, etc., all need a large number of chip support. With its excellent technical strength and market performance, WiMi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology, and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. With the acceleration of the global digital transformation, WiMi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry.

**To sum up**

In the past few years, the global chip industry has been in a downturn, with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. Today, the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market, and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. However, as the competition in the AI chip market intensifies, it will be interesting to see who will emerge from the AI wave, and how this important market will change in the future.",2024-03-05,2,2

1alxkqt_META,META,"Yes, Meta shares are still attractive after Q4 earnings","Meta Platforms, Inc. released its Q4 earnings report, surpassing expectations and surprising investors with its performance.

The company added $205 billion to its market cap, with shares rising by 20% following the release. Q4 revenue stood at $40.11 billion, up 24.7% YoY, driven by improved ad impressions and price per ad growth.

Meta's active user base grew to almost 4 billion, with strong growth in both new and existing platforms. Despite Reality Labs' operating losses, Meta generated substantial free cash flow, leading to its first-ever dividend payment in March and a $50 billion buyback authorization.

This should make Meta one of the most attractive dividend growth stocks!

Management's Q1 outlook exceeded Wall Street expectations, with solid revenue guidance and expectations for further margin improvements.

Financial projections indicate continued revenue and EPS growth. Meanwhile, Meta is trading at a relatively cheap valuation compared to its growth potential. For reference, it now trades at just 23.5x this year's earnings and a PEG of just below 1.2x. Meanwhile, it should be able to easily keep growth in the double digits for the foreseeable future.

Do you guys still think Meta shares are attractive based on all of this?

I‚Äôm hoping I built some wisdom moving forward. There will be other 5x-10x or greater companies in my lifetime. Got to strike when the iron is hot. I‚Äôm also reflecting on why I continually didn‚Äôt buy on the way up. I had a bias that it had already run too far.

**Summary of last post:**

Recent IPO, low cap stock with unique technology that reduces video storage costs between 30-50%. Work with 3 top 5 largest media companies in the world (including Netflix, publicly shared). 

Hold 53 AI patents and have received awards for their revolutionary technology.

Announced partnership with $NVDA, who are working with them to launch a SaaS product available to a broader market (moving from software licensing to a SaaS-based billing model, with easy access). 

The stock popped 6 X on the day of the announcement. 

Currently in BETA and will launch the product in Q1, 2024. Proved market fit and set grounds for monopolising the media industry. 

Please see for more info on the original post here (including upcoming catalyst, investors, Management etc.)

**Quick Numbers:**

Share Price: $1.22 (since last post 1.21, good support)

TP: $6-8 (if you catch PoPs during catalyst) ‚Äì official TP by investment bank set at 5$ by the end of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

Since the post, there have been a few updates (gathered from their social channels and other sources rather than official shareholder updates ‚Äì expect this very soon as there is a LOT). All links for references have been provided below (for fact-checking üòä ).

The bulleted list is expanded in below:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Featured on NASDAQ as top 5 best-emerging growth stocks 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Started to hire Sales executives for SaaS product launch 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CTO participating at Video Scale Conference panel discussion with 3 x $META employees (one of their not publicly announced customers‚Ä¶ hmmm?) 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $NVDA officially shared more details of their partnership with $BMR and technical details of the solution for video rendering. 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $BMR announces to support Machine Learning video operations.

**Featured on NASDAQ as top 5 best-emerging growth stocks** 

Beamr‚Äôs CEO Sharon Carmel presented at the ThinkEquity conference on October 19th in New York. 

In short, this conference is leveraged by top investment banks/firms to identify investment opportunities in low-cap, emerging stocks. This event is held yearly, and results are publicly shared of how much investment each stock has received (investment range from $1.5 million to $100 million) 

Obviously, there is a delay in presenting/getting known amongst investors and receiving investment. Firms must do their due diligence. However, it is evident this event gathers investors as transactions are publicly shared on their website as a result of the event with roughly 2-3 new investments made by every month. 

So, we may not expect an investment firm to throw money at $BMR in the next month, however, we can assume this will happen in 2024. 

Why can we assume so? Well, for one, they do really solve a real issue with innovative products and many other reasons listed at the start of the post. I won‚Äôt go into detail, but it‚Äôs safe to assume they have gathered interest in order for NASDAQ to officially list $BMR as one of the top 5 emerging stocks out of the list of 75, suggesting they got something in the bag. 

**Started to hire Sales executives for SaaS product launch** 

This is an interesting one, they launched a BETA version in autumn to test their APIs and a bunch of other things to improve, adjust their SaaS etc. This is a free trial with a very easy way to reduce video storage costs. We can assume the trial version has gathered 100s if not 1000s of new users to test out their product in an autonomous fashion. 

In sales, this is the easiest way to gather customers. Pumping new sales executives with warm leads. 

Alongside that, they are starting to ramp up for launch, hiring new sales executives. They have posted job ads on LinkedIn and now have closed them off (for 1 Sales role, they received 150 applications).

**CTO participating at Video Scale Conference panel discussion with 3 x $META employees (one of their not publicly announced customers‚Ä¶ hmmm?)** 

This is a yearly event that brings top industry technology engineers to discuss the future of video technology: current challenges, things to solve and the outlook. 

Everyone technical tunes in to this event, this is a platform to learn from top industry peers. And Yes, the CTO from $BMR is amongst the panel members that includes $META engineers. This is an immense amount of exposure they are receiving, being recognized as one of the top video technology companies. 

They are surrounded by GIANTS, and makes me wonder if they are, too, working with META? You don‚Äôt just get randomly invited to such panel discussions showcasing how innovative your technology stack is. 

**$NVDA officially shared more details of their partnership with $BMR and technical details of the solution for video rendering.** 

$BMR, a few days ago, shared a technical post from $NVDA of how they customised their GPUs to work with $BMR technology to reduce video storage costs (I won‚Äôt get into details here as it is too technical, and you can read all about it in the link below to $NVDA website post). 

In short, Nvidia would not invest resources or time and collaborate to some random, questionable technology businesses to customise their GPUs. This is a big, meaty thing‚Ä¶. Ask yourself, why would a multi-billion company partner with a low cap, recent IPO stock‚Ä¶. They are recognizing something big here. 

**$BMR announces support for Machine Learning video operations.** 

Short and snappy, too technical here (details in the references section). Machine learning as you may be aware, is key to AI development. What $BMR shared is that they are now fully compatible with ML models that reduce storage requirements, applying their cost optimization for AI.

Cramer's wishing for stock splits to make these big players more accessible to the everyday investor, aka the ""home gamer."" He's also got a bone to pick with the bearish analysts and media raining on the parade. 

Cramer's tackling concerns about Amazon Web Services slowing down, but he's not losing sleep over it. Amazon just dropped a collab bomb with NVIDIA, diving into software and generative artificial intelligence. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with Cramer's call for more positivity in the media, or do you think the bears have a point?

**FOMC**

So lets talk about FOMC‚Ä¶ what was said and what can we expect in the future‚Ä¶

(I am going to just copy and past some tweets here for you to read and then I will discuss)

¬∑ The Fed raised its funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. The midpoint of this range would be the highest level for the benchmark rate since early 2001.

¬∑ Fed Powell: The full effects of tightening are yet to be felt.

¬∑ Fed's Powell: We haven't made any decisions about future meetings.

¬∑ Powell: Inflation has proven more resilient than expected.

¬∑ Powell has said that the staff are no longer forecasting a recession.

¬∑ Federal Reserve's Powell has said: I don't see inflation back at 2% until about 2025.

¬∑ FOMC: Voted 11-0 For Fed Funds Rate Action 

¬∑ FOMC: Economic Activity Has Been Expanding At a Moderate Pace 

¬∑ FOMC: Job Gains Have Been Robust in Recent Months, Unemployment Rate Has Remained Low 

¬∑ FOMC Will Continue to Assess Additional Information, Implications for Monetary Policy 

¬∑ FOMC: Future Actions Depend on Tightening Impact, Economic and Financial Developments

¬∑ FED SWAPS CONTINUE PRICING IN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL HIKE

¬∑ Analyst: Fed May Consider Another Rate Hike In September, But Will Assess The Impact Of Previous Moves And Inflation Trends Before Making A Decision

¬∑ POWELL: FOMC TO TAKE DATA-DEPENDENT APPROACH ON FUTURE HIKES, WILL MAKE DECISIONS MEETING BY MEETING

¬∑ POWELL: WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT ANY FUTURE MEETINGS

¬∑ Analyst: The Lack Of Changes In The Policy Statement Was A Surprise, And While There Was A Slight Increase In The Hawkish Tone Regarding Economic Growth, The Overall Message Is That The Fed Is Neither Dismissing Nor Confirming The Possibility Of Another Rate Hike.

Overall the message here is about what I expected‚Ä¶ I expected JPOw to neither confirm nor deny a further rate hike in September but rather to say that it was data depenedent like usual‚Ä¶ honestly much of his speech was about the same as the last 6 meetings‚Ä¶ same story different day‚Ä¶ a few notable mentions though is that JPOW did say they do not forecast a recession and that they admitted inflation is more resilient than expected. 

It will be interesting to see how markets digest this over night as this was one of the more mild if not the mildest reaction to a FOMC day that I have ever seen. 

**META EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1na8uc90edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9996a49cdceeb3002c7db0c360fbb76e19513d16

As of right now META has a major green reaction‚Ä¶ it has as of this writing given back a lot of the green‚Ä¶ 

Digging deeper into the earnings looks like a nice revenue and EPS beat‚Ä¶ also a bit of a surprising upside beat on active users‚Ä¶ as of right now though there is not really enough of a move up though at 5% (as of writing) to beat the implied move‚Ä¶ likely calls and puts will lose on this one‚Ä¶ it will also be curious to see how markets react on the call‚Ä¶ that is where both MSFT and TSLA met their demise. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zipky3p0edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc21ec8afb4badfa6fb2f193aa996436d680080

Overall on Spy this actually was a terribly boring range bound day‚Ä¶ prior to actual FOMC minutes we didn‚Äôt even break $1.2 for most of the day‚Ä¶ in the end though SPY finally broke through this massive wall at $455 that we have been fighting at‚Ä¶ however, we were not able to breach and hold over 456.82 supply‚Ä¶. That currently remains our next upside resistance. 

We were extremely close until pretty much the last second of putting a new supply in today‚Ä¶ but with that last minute push up we were able to avoid that‚Ä¶ We continue to hold the daily ema support also‚Ä¶. With a daily dmi wave up the favor remains to the upside but we are clearly stuck in this range‚Ä¶. I wouldn‚Äôt be too aggressive going long until spy closes over 456.82 and I wouldn‚Äôt be too eager to short until we close under 452.1. Anything in between is straight consolidation and chop. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 452.1 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/niuyhi61edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4abd4d1b9774c674e464fede21e55085b4541a6

A real tough move on Futures here with the double top but bounce off of the daily 8ema support. We did just barely avoid a daily supply being put in‚Ä¶ as of now momentum continues to be to the upside. Our next major resistance will be 4621. Bulls also will need to defend 4595 supply as support or we likely will see a retest of 4563 demand. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply -4596 -> 4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4563 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3bicx1m1edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=896021bd8984d1bd6af8c29df803f642e9a39172

This was a bit of a struggle day for QQQ today‚Ä¶ we also barely and narrowly EOD survived not putting a new supply in‚Ä¶ however we were able to backtest the 376.16 demand and also daily 20ema support and hold those levels‚Ä¶

We continue to see a daily DMI waving up, however, bulls need to retake the daily 8ema resistance tomorrow and also need to close over 379.16 to break this consolidation on QQQ‚Ä¶ Likely with the meta beat we could see a nice post-fomc bounce tomorrow on TECH. 

There is quite a bit of support being established here at this 376 level which should lead to further upside from here‚Ä¶ 385.73 remains my first upside target with 388.47 and 389.92 as the next major upside target. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.16 -> 400.01

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h8hn952edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f080052b1f5917fe43f592049fc382a50778cac

Unsurprisingly the VIX did see a downside move today and did close back under the daily 8ema and also established a new daily supply‚Ä¶ we only slightly moved the current 14 supply to 14.02‚Ä¶ this 14 level on the VIX has become a solid resistance and rejection area‚Ä¶ 

We also interestingly enough closed below the 13.29 and 13.59 demand. Next major support is 12.89 on the VIX‚Ä¶ 

The VIX continues to point to further upside or minimally consolidation on the markets. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

As a momentum/ breakout trader I have got to say this‚Ä¶ these last 3 days of trading have pretty much been my worst case scenario‚Ä¶ absolutely no continuation, no breakouts and just overall terrible technicals for entries. Not only that when we finally do get a solid A+ set up we are left with such tiny range and movements that we don‚Äôt even receive a proper payout. 

I am hoping regardless of what way the markets choose to go that they chose to go that way in a decently big way‚Ä¶ ",2023-07-26,12,1
15a5p9e_META,META,Expected moves: FOMC and Facebook/Meta,"Tons of earnings again today, highlighted by META after the close.

META's expected move of around 8% is significantly less than the prior 3 actual moves. The last time the stock moved less than that on earnings was this quarter's report last year.

There's also a Fed meeting today! The 0DTE expected move in SPY today is about 0.7% which is not 'high' but it is a lot more than recent 0DTE expected moves which have been around 0.4%. So between the slate of earnings and the FOMC, options are pricing almost twice as much movement as they have been at these extremely low levels of IV. In fact, today's SPY options are 14 IV, they've been as low as the single digits recently. After the FOMC, options reset a bit, with the expected move into Friday just 0.9% and next week's options back to 11 IV.

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million ‚Äúpoints of interest,‚Äù such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,‚Äù Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, ‚ÄúCan we just get collaboration around the open base map?‚Äù Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs maps aren‚Äôt ideal, because they don‚Äôt provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. ‚ÄúThat works for a lot of people, but not for others,‚Äù Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.",2023-07-26,801,180

I like this trade because a large move in the stock should pump up the October options. I'm collecting $3000 from the the July 28 options, and for that position to settle negative overall would mean I have ITM (or near ITM) options for October with plenty of time left in a stock that just moved 10%.

In no way am I suggesting this is risk free or ""How can I lose!?"". I can think of many ways to lose on this trade, but I'm collecting substantial premium, risk is 'capped' and a wild price move would actually be a benefit.",2023-07-18,4,6

13onqvj_META,META,Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it‚Äôs hit with record ‚Ç¨1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,"It‚Äôs finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.

Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined ‚Ç¨1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) ‚Äî which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)

Meta‚Äôs sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people‚Äôs information.


European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.

In a press release announcing today‚Äôs decision the EDPB‚Äôs chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:

> The EDPB found that Meta IE‚Äôs [Ireland‚Äôs] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organisations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.

The Facebook parent is testing the product with influencers and some creators, according to the report.

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Meta has been contacting talent agencies and celebrities to gauge their interest in trying an early version of the app, which will be integrated with Instagram, said Alex Heath, reporter at the Verge, in a newsletter.

""The decentralized app is built on the back of Instagram but will be compatible with some other apps like Mastodon,"" according to a newsletter by Lia Haberman, who teaches social and influencer marketing at UCLA in California.

&#x200B;

This cup and handle is playing out beautifully which gives us a soft target of 402.6 for EOW. However, I continue to see a bigger downside target of 399. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r04zz8udkawa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f67f95fccf0c2458c5f2b89a18ee531141fb7b

While some say TA doesn‚Äôt work and that its all fake‚Ä¶ analyzing the past can be predictive of the future‚Ä¶ this is as of now playing out perfectly for the weekly close back under 407.3 which should start the next bigger leg down. 

**Calendar**

Tomorrow we get more jobless data and GDP‚Ä¶ currently the alantafed nowcasts says GDP is going to take a huge hit tomorrow. If we take a huge hit GDP like that that could put us back on the path to see a recession by the EOY.

We are seeing a ‚Äúbeat‚Äù on META but if you read between the lines‚Ä¶ this forward guidance is real dog water if you ask me. 

Im starting to remember why I just as a blanket statement refuse to play earnings‚Ä¶ at least it was a small lotto and about 30% of it paid for when I repositioned. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

On a daily timeframe here we did have a 405.17 supply that we did come down to finally take out. We have officially cleared out all the supplies that were left down below except for one at 399.07‚Ä¶ for me until we establish a new demand (support) my target will remain at 399.07. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qdvobbofkawa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d455969f63e5cd4630eef3e56f126116285015a

One thing that I said I was looking for today was a bounce and retest of the daily 20ema‚Ä¶ I actually expected us to put in a green day but instead we actually tested it and hard rejected and closed under critical support of 405.2‚Ä¶ Now that we have closed under 405.2 we have a very clear move down to 399 and possibly 390.. the thing to know about SPY is that it is very consistent with its channels. What I mean is SPY likes its ranges‚Ä¶ now that we have fallen out of the 405.2 to 420 range we should start re-considering the 390 to 405.2 range. 

We did come down and tested the daily 50ema support but held over that. Tomorrow my target is 399 which will get us under the daily 100/ 200ema‚Ä¶ Historically speaking SPY does not like to move through the 200ema whether bullishly or bearishly without a fight. Meaning that when we do get to the 200ema that likely will be our bounce area and 399 is where I play to take profits on my 86dte 408P. 

We have officially started a resistance line down and will keep a close eye on that along with 405.2 and the daily 20ema. 

The question now is can this META ‚Äúbeat‚Äù actually hold SPY up‚Ä¶ because clearly google and MSFT couldn‚Äôt. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 412.6  
 Demand- 395.6 -> 406.6 -> 409.2  
 Support- 404.3 -> 401.4 -> 399.8  
 Resistance- 405.2 -> 406.8 -> 409.1

Futures confirmed the 4117 as resistance (not a new supply just back tested and held as resistance) and here we are seeing a push down to 4040/4055 supply to take those levels out. I remain bearish and until a new demand (support) is established our target should be this 4040/4055 supply. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iqsvmtugkawa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d4a7fb52dba7132eb146b45adb317e13c46b88

Futures is set attempting to hold this 4081 support line after hours. However, now that we have a clear cut back test of the daily 20ema and closure under the 4095 critical support level‚Ä¶ my downside target remains 4040/4055 which would be exactly touching the daily 100/200ema. There is potential of a bigger sell off down to 3920 but I would expect that to come post FOMC. 

Daily Futures Level  
 Supply- 4040 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4005 -> 4117  
 Support- 4081 -> 4055 -> 4040  
 Resistance-4095 -> 4110 -> 4138

**VIX**

The VIX is a little hard to read here today‚Ä¶ so on one hand we have a really clear and nice v bottom and we despite the doji candle did bounce to retest the daily 8ema support and closed over the daily 20ema for the 2nd time in a row‚Ä¶ we have not done that since March 17th/ 20th. However, one could absolutely see this daily doji candle as a evening doji star reversal. 

The VIX clearly has been reacting to the FRC news and the markets are starting to finally accept some of bearishness that is ahead. GDP tomorrow morning will be incredibly interesting to see if markets start to price in a recession or not.

I absolutely struggled this morning. The volatility of opening hours was some of the highest (realized not relative) that I have seen in a while). Premiums were moving so fast it was nearly impossible to get filled and by time I did fill it seemed that we were immediately reversing. I have not had so many stop losses immediately hit in a very long time as I did today. 

Thankfully the 2nd half of the day I was really able to capitalize on price action and make it back and then some. Currently (even with my small lotto meta loss) im already over my weekly goal. With two days to go this week I look forward to putting in another profitable week. 

The hardest thing I struggle with lately is that at times I am noticing price action pushing through technical. There are a lot of times that I find myself missing the move as the technical never fully reset from say bearish to bullish to take a call‚Ä¶ and there are other times it does reset and then it‚Äôs a fake out. 

However, the one thing I will say and I have said all of last year too is that capital preservation and risk management is the key to success‚Ä¶ for instance at one point this morning was down about a full days profit goal‚Ä¶ instead of revenge trading (despite getting frustrated at price action) I stuck to my rules, respected my stop losses and waited for my time to make some money. Its not always straight green and its not always easy trading every day. But no matter how good or bad of a day we are having/ have had we have to respect our strategy and our rules. 

Risk management will always be the key to long term success and profitability.",2023-04-26,3,0

Highlights - 

* Restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. 
* Reduce team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles.
* Flatter is faster - **removing multiple layers of management.** As part of this, we will ask many managers to become individual contributors. 
* Leaner is better - Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster.
* **In-person time helps build relationships** and get more done.
* Another goal for the Year of Efficiency is to improve our business performance given the **new economic reality**.
* This new economic reality will **continue for many years.**
* Most companies will scale back their long term vision and investments.
*  Our **single largest investment is in advancing AI** and building it into every one of our products.

Sentiment could easily get worse, but you're getting plenty of long-term compensation for buying Google at today's prices. Far from being an AI victim, Google looks well positioned for whatever the future of AI may bring, and the lack of positive investor sentiment around this makes it even better to buy. You can buy Google here comfortably, and if the forward PE gets anywhere near where Meta's did, you can ramp up your purchases.

Google is not a recession-proof stock, they're not guaranteed to crush the competition in the AI space, and the company isn't yet as cheap as Meta was during their 2022 debacle. But Google is a great business for a good price.

10rbv6y_META,META,Meta's Valuation: It was a Screaming Buy at $89 in November 2022; How About at $140 and Now at $180?,"Meta climbed to $180 today after the announcement of its earnings.  Here's what the 8-K that came out today announced:

2022 revenue of $116.6b over $117.9b in 2021.  This is the first time Meta's annual revenue declined since inception. Prior to this, Meta's annual revenue growth averaged 34%.  2022 EBITDA amounted to $37.6b, which is a decline of 32.5% from 2021.  This lower EBITDA is largely due to spiraling costs related to Reality Labs, which reported $13.7b in losses in 2022.  Total costs and expenses amounted to $87.5b in 2022, which is an increase of 23% over 2021.  Most astonishingly, Meta reported $35.3b in R&D expense (30% of revenue) which were predominantly devoted to Reality Labs, I think.  That is an astonishing amount:  Meta's R&D expense never even approached $25 billion prior to this year.

But Meta is still a FCF-generating machine.  This company had an EBITDA margin of 47-58% the last 5 years, which is stunning, before enormous expenses related to Reality Labs shrank it to 32% in 2022.  Its FCF margin is 32% the last 5 years and FCF yield is 8.5-11%; they will be somewhat lower in 2022 due to Reality Labs expenses and capex.

All of the above developments, particularly the problems related to monetizing Reality Labs, were in the stock price prior to the announcement -- this resulted in Meta's stock price declining from $379 in August 2021 to $89 in November 2022.  Now that Q4 and FY2022 is over, Meta's near-term outlook and its pledge to buy back shares and soft-pedal expenses related to Reality Labs are boosting the stock price.

At $89, Meta was a screaming buy.  At $140, Meta was trading at 10x EBITDA and 8x CY2023 EBITDA and 17-18x P/Es.  These are very reasonable numbers for a tech growth company.  At $180, Meta is at 12x LTM and 10x forward EBITDA; the P/Es are 21-22x.  Those may still look good but we are likely entering an ad recession so the numbers might shrink further and the valuations could then fall.  Still, long-term investors will prolly fare well at $180.  That is even with the risk of Reality Labs affecting the company throughout Meta's near-term future.

The time to get into Meta was at $140.  Anything under $160 would give you great returns. There are many, many people kicking themselves when the market overreacted and let Meta fall to $89 last Fall.",2023-02-02,5,26

Revenue was $32.2 billion, compared with the average Wall Street estimates of $31.6 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. Meta is making progress with its investments in artificial intelligence, particularly for improving the videos it shows users on Facebook and Instagram.

Facebook, Meta‚Äôs flagship social network, now has more than 2 billion daily users, up more than 70 million from a year ago.

Meta also projected revenue of $26 billion to $28.5 billion for the first quarter, in line with estimates of $27.25 billion. The company also boosted its stock-buyback authorization by $40 billion, adding to the $10.9 billion remaining from previous repurchase programs.

Earnings: $1.76 per share


Revenue:  $32.17 billion vs $31.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv


It is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to analyst estimates of $2.22 per share. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:

Daily Active Users (DAUs): 1.99 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Monthly Active Users (MAUs):  2.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $10.63 expected, according to StreetAccount


Meta‚Äôs sales are expected to drop for a third consecutive quarter, underscoring the challenges the social media company faces as economic uncertainty leads businesses to reduce digital ad spending and pause campaigns.

Analysts expect the Facebook parent company to report a revenue decline of more than 6% for the fourth quarter, and they‚Äôre projecting one more quarterly drop before growth begins to tick back up later this year.

While the stock market started to rebound in January from a brutal 2022, economic forecasts still show a fairly gloomy 2023, which could spell continuing trouble for the online ad market. A recent Cowen survey of 50 ad buyers found that companies are planning to increase their ad spending in 2023 by only 3.3%, which the investment bank said is ‚Äúthe softest ad growth outlook we‚Äôve seen in five years.‚Äù

On Tuesday, Snap reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed estimates, sending the shares tumbling in extended trading. The company also said its ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù assumes a revenue drop in the first quarter of between 2% and 10%.

While much smaller than Meta, Snap faces some of the same challenges, including a slowdown in online ad spending, increased competition from TikTok and weakened targeted advertising due to Apple‚Äôs 2021 iOS privacy update. Alphabet and Amazon will wrap up earnings reports from the major online ad platforms on Thursday, followed by Pinterest next week.

In November, Meta said it would lay off over 11,000 employees, or 13% of the workforce, as part of the company‚Äôs plans to reduce costs.

‚ÄúWe are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1,‚Äù CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees at the time.

Last year was also marred by Zuckerberg‚Äôs costly effort to sell Wall Street on a plan to pivot the company towards the yet-to-be-developed world of the metaverse. Zuckerberg has said the metaverse, which would include virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, could represent the next major way people interact.

The big bet has frustrated investors, who worry the company is putting too much focus on a futuristic endeavor while its core ad business struggles to revive growth. Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs unit, home to the metaverse ambitions, lost nearly $9.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2022.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show an operating loss of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter on revenue of $715.1 million, according to StreetAccount. Meta said last quarter that ‚ÄúReality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year.‚Äù",2023-02-01,722,375

**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**

>meta exclusive newsÔºö[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment\_CA/comments/10an9pr/us\_stock\_marketdow\_futures\_steady\_after\_cpi\_eases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment_CA/comments/10an9pr/us_stock_marketdow_futures_steady_after_cpi_eases/)

The market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.

More importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.

**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**

Plus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.

This upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.

Meta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.

Meta‚Äôs growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.

Meta's valuation is looking enticing and let‚Äôs not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that‚Äôs still very impressive.

**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**

Amazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.

Amazon‚Äôs growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.

>Meta could fairly easily afford to repurchase $10B of its shares each quarter, especially if the company were to recalibrate its investments in the Reality Labs business. Based off of Meta Platforms' Q3'22 cash flow statement, the company spent $6.35B on Class A stock buybacks in the third-quarter and $21.09B in the first nine months of FY 2022. In FY 2021, however, Meta Platforms repurchased $44.54B of its shares and the company did so at a significantly higher valuation. The tech company paid an average of $330 per-share in FY 2021 and therefore paid a massively inflated price to buy back a ton of its own stock just when the stock price peaked.

>Plotting Meta Platforms' stock buybacks against the P/E ratio shows that Meta Platforms repurchased a ton of its shares at the exact wrong time: when the pandemic and advertisers temporarily inflated the firm's revenue growth, Meta Platforms' market cap was at an all-time high‚Ä¶ and when the stock was historically expensive.

>	Meta Platforms is trading at $120 right now and the share price hasn't been this low since the start of 2017 (with the exception of the October/November 2022 draw-down) and, at a P/E ratio of 15.2 X, I believe Meta Platforms is at an attractive valuation level to warrant a material up-size in its stock buyback. At the end of the September-quarter, the tech company had $17.78B in its stock authorization remaining, and Meta Platforms could very well exhaust this program in FY 2023. Right now is possibly the best time since 2017 for Meta Platforms to reevaluate its capital allocation strategy and buy back more of its stock while reducing its investments in the Reality Labs business.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into a few segments:

1. What is Meta?
2. How to value Meta?
3. Historical financial performance and assumptions about the future
4. Valuation
5. Is Reality Labs that bad?
6. The different scenarios

**What is Meta?**

Meta doesn't really need any introduction, everyone knows their main products (Facebook/Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp), but what caused the decline in recent years is the change of their vision from these apps (that are known as ""Family of Apps"") to the metaverse idea (known as ""Reality Labs"").

**How to value Meta?**

Since one of the goals of this post is to value Meta, the question is, how to value these two operating segments?

The ""Family of Apps"" is the cash-generating machine, and there's a decade of financial data available to understand how it has performed when it comes to revenue and operating margin.

However, the second part is what brings the uncertainty in here. Regardless of the model used to value the ""Reality Labs"", the inputs/variables are too uncertain to create anything that's reasonable.

For that reason, I decided to take a different approach. I'll value the mature segment, the ""Family of Apps"" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at.

&#x200B;

So, let's get started!

**Historical financial performance & assumptions about the future**

Over the last 5 years, the ""Family of Apps"" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive.

Looking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.

However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.

When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&D being poured in.

Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**.

**Valuation**

Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"".

But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.

If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.

The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.

Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:

""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook & complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian & whining about your privacy being invaded.""

**So, what can be done?**

Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.

**Is Reality labs that bad?**

This is a question that will be answered a decade from now.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"".

So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.

Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.

**The Michael Burry tweet**

The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.

One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.

I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.

Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.

What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.

This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

Could he be wrong? Absolutely!

There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.

**The different scenarios**

What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.

What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.

As for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.",2022-11-06,380,344

I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.

However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.

When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&D being poured in.

Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**.

**Valuation**

Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"".

But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.

If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.

The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.

Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:

""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook & complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian & whining about your privacy being invaded.""

**So, what can be done?**

Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.

**Is Reality labs that bad?**

This is a question that will be answered a decade from now.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"".

So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.

Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.

**The Michael Burry tweet**

The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.

One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.

I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.

Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.

What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.

This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

Could he be wrong? Absolutely!

There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.

**The different scenarios**

What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.

What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.

As for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.",2022-11-06,79,86

## Selling the Move vs Selling IV

With implied volatility high the past few weeks we‚Äôve detailed some trade strategies that try to take advantage of, or at least mitigate the inflated cost of options in this environment. With some of the largest market cap companies in the stock market reporting this week, it‚Äôs a good time to detail the difference between what high IV does to the expected move, and how much a stock needs to move in order for long premium trades to work, or for short premium trades to fail, versus selling high IV as a strategy in and of itself.

Using Apple (AAPL), which reports this week as an example, we‚Äôll look at the difference between selling the earnings moves, and selling high IV, by comparing two Iron Condors at different expiries. The first Condor, is set at the expected move for this week, with short strikes at 140, and 155, vs AAPL‚Äôs Friday close near $147. The second Condor, expires Dec 18th, and the expected move short strikes set at 135, and 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygjv9ikgbov91.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=800fc09a4be5516397545c529faf02e015b75b80

The Condor expiring this week is a pure expected move strategy. If AAPL stays within the breakevens of 138.50, and 158.50, the trade makes money. Outside of that range, the strategy loses money. The level of IV is less important than the pure move AAPL makes this week on earnings. The trade is fairly binary.

However, with the Dec 18th condor being $10 wider, it‚Äôs less about the move and more about selling high IV in AAPL into earnings (as well as high IV overall in the market). The likelihood of AAPL moving beyond this trade‚Äôs breakeven of 132.50 and 162.50 on earnings is not as likely, and therefore the trade is less binary about the move itself and is more a strategy to sell high IV into earnings, with the idea that the trade could be closed for less in the weeks after, with IV lower.

For the past decade there were two more or less universally acknowledged truths about digital advertising. First, the rapidly growing industry was largely impervious to the business cycle. Second, it was dominated by the duopoly of Google (in search ads) and Meta (in social media), which one jealous rival has compared to John Rockefeller‚Äôs hold on oil in the 19th century.

Both of these verities are now being challenged simultaneously. As China‚Äôs economy slows and the West‚Äôs slides towards a recession, companies everywhere are squeezing their marketing budgets. Until recently, that would have meant cutting non-digital ads but maintaining, or even raising, online spending. With most ad dollars now going online, that strategy is running out of road. Last quarter Meta reported its first-ever year-on-year decline in revenues. Snap, a smaller rival, is laying off a fifth of its workforce.

For Meta and Google‚Äôs corporate parent, Alphabet, the cyclical problem may not be the worst of it. They might once have hoped to offset the digital-ad pie‚Äôs slower growth by grabbing a larger slice of it. No longer. Although the two are together expected to rake in around $300bn in revenues this year, sales of their four biggest rivals in the West will amount to almost a quarter as much. If that does not sound like a lot, it is nevertheless giving the incumbents reason to worry. Five years ago most of those rivals were scarcely in the ad business at all (see chart). What is more, as digital advertising enters a period of transformation, the challengers look well-placed to increase their gains.

The noisiest newcomer to the digital-ad scene is TikTok. In the five years since its launch the short-video app has sucked ad dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, Meta‚Äôs two biggest properties. So much so that the two social networks are reinventing themselves in the image of their Chinese-owned rival. TikTok‚Äôs worldwide revenue will exceed $11bn this year and will be double that by 2024, forecasts eMarketer, a firm of analysts.

The TikTok threat is well known‚Äînot least to Meta‚Äôs boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who mentioned the ‚Äúunique‚Äù competitor five times on a recent earnings call. But Meta and Google may have more to worry about closer to home, where a trio of American tech firms are loading ever more ads around their main businesses.

Chief among them is Amazon, forecast to take nearly 7% of worldwide digital-ad revenue this year, up from less than 1% just six years ago. The company started reporting details of its ad business only in February, when it revealed sales in 2021 of $31bn. As Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, points out, that is roughly as much as the ad sales of the entire global newspaper industry. Amazon executives now talk of advertising as one of the company‚Äôs three ‚Äúengines‚Äù, alongside retail and cloud computing.

Next in line is Microsoft, expected to quietly take more than 2% of global sales this year‚Äîslightly more than TikTok. Its search engine, Bing, has only a small share of the search market, but that market is a gigantic one. Microsoft‚Äôs social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap‚Äôs Snapchat and Twitter.

The most surprising new adman is Apple. The iPhone-maker used to rail against intrusive digital advertising. Now it sells many ads of its own. As sales of smartphones plateau, the company is looking for new ways to monetise the 1.8bn devices, from smartphones to smart earphones, it already has in circulation. So far it is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple‚Äôs ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter. Apple executives believe there is much more to be had.

They may well be right. Changes are coming to the digital-advertising industry which will suit the big-tech challengers. Apple itself is in part responsible for what may be the most consequential development. Its rules on ‚Äúapp-tracking transparency‚Äù (att), introduced last year, have made it much harder for advertisers to follow users around the web to serve them ads based on their interests. The eu‚Äôs Digital Services Act, unveiled earlier this year, takes steps in the same direction. America is mulling similar legislation of its own.

The crackdown on tracking has been especially hard on platforms that serve display ads, which target consumers on the basis of their interests, as opposed to things they have actively searched for. Meta, whose social networks specialise in such ads, said in February that att would knock $10bn off its ad business this year. It is trying to develop other ways of divining consumers‚Äô interests. So are smaller platforms reliant on display ads, but their task is more difficult without Meta‚Äôs deep pockets. Or at least that is how investors see it: Snap‚Äôs market value has plummeted by 83%, or $97bn, in the past 12 months.

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, by contrast, are insulated against anti-tracking initiatives. They rely mostly on ‚Äúfirst party‚Äù data of their own. Amazon‚Äôs ads are based on what users search for on its site: type ‚Äúsocks‚Äù into its search bar and you will see sponsored promotions for exactly that. Microsoft‚Äôs Bing is similarly immune. LinkedIn is probably less so, though Microsoft could theoretically use data from Bing to fine-tune the ads shown to LinkedIn users (at the moment it does not, though it has looked into it). Ads on Apple‚Äôs app store follow the same principle as Amazon: search for TikTok, say, and you may see an ad for a rival app like Pinterest. Apple is rumoured to be preparing to introduce ads on its Maps app, to promote local businesses. Through its move into payments it could learn about customers‚Äô shopping habits. None of this would require tracking, since the behaviour all happens on Apple‚Äôs platform.

Advertising‚Äôs other big coming change is the migration of television-viewing from broadcast and cable to internet-connected tvs, capable of delivering targeted ads. Amazon has already shown ads alongside sport on its Prime Video streaming service. Apple has done the same on Apple tv+, and may yet launch an ad-supported subscription tier, as rivals Netflix and Disney+ soon will. Microsoft has no tv offering, but its acquisition earlier this year of Xandr, an ad-tech company, has given it a foothold in serving ads for other streamers. In July Netflix chose Microsoft to run its forthcoming ad business‚Äîto disappointment at Google, which had bid for the contract, and to some surprise at Microsoft itself.

Digital advertising is spreading into other markets where the new challengers are well positioned. Audio is undergoing a similar digitisation to video, as listening switches to streamed music and podcasting. This presents an opportunity for Amazon and Apple, both of which have audio-streaming services and make smart speakers. Both also have voice-activated assistants, Alexa and Siri, who could just as easily bark out promotions as take orders. Amazon sees Alexa as a future saleswoman as well as a servant.

Meanwhile, Microsoft‚Äôs pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-gaming giant, will make it a powerful force in that fast-growing and increasingly ad-supported industry. Its Xbox console already shows some ads on the user‚Äôs on-screen ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù and will reportedly soon offer more help for developers to sell in-game ads. Activision‚Äôs units include King, the maker of ‚ÄúCandy Crush‚Äù; last year King generated revenue of $2.6bn from ads and in-game purchases by its quarter of a billion players.

As digital ads work their way into more corners of the economy, ‚Äúa new order is going to materialise‚Äù, believes Mr Lipsman. He thinks Amazon will overtake Meta in total advertising revenue, possibly within five years. Google is better placed to take advantage of the coming changes, with its healthy search ads and its vast YouTube video and audio services. Still, it will find things more competitive in future. The incumbent digital-ad duo might have hoped that, as ever more advertising went online, their empires would only extend. It looks instead as if new rivals will reach into their business.",2022-09-18,385,94

I mean, this was a company highly regarded ONE YEAR AGO! With a large user base, and huge streams of income. But now it seems to be demonized.

Ok, I do understand all the headwinds it faces like:

1. the privacy updates from Apple and Android;

2. the company will have huge outflows of cash due to the investment in the building of ""the metaverse"";

3. the management's social image;

4. the user growth slowing down.

BUT:

1. Even with all this turmoil the company is still able to generate large sums of income;

2. I don't think the company hasn't maxed out its ARPU; mainly ex-USA;

3. User growth from emerging markets is STILL growing;

4. THE. BALANCE. SHEEEEET. - Like... It's one of the best IN. THE. WORLD. And now that we're seeing some uncertainty for the future, I think having a strong and stable balance sheet is one of the best things to come out victorious at the end.

x7gd8d_META,META,Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children‚Äôs privacy settings on Instagram,"check this out

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)

A fat fine ‚Äî of $402 million ‚Äî is headed Instagram‚Äôs way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children‚Äôs data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram‚Äôs parent, Friday ‚Äî ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company‚Äôs lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland‚Äôs Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities ‚Äî however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland‚Äôs DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: ‚ÄúWe adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of ‚Ç¨405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.‚Äù

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) ‚Äî following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR‚Äôs transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform‚Äôs processing of children‚Äôs data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally ‚Äî as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children‚Äôs information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn‚Äôt leak early).

While today‚Äôs headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it‚Äôs under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children‚Äôs data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it‚Äôs likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland‚Äôs draft decision ‚Äî triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland‚Äôs WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft ‚Äî and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

x3at6w_META,META,"Apple already decimated Meta‚Äôs ad-tech empire. Now, it‚Äôs homing in on Facebook‚Äôs advertisers, too.","In terms of Silicon Valley feuds, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find one that‚Äôs spicier than the years-long battle between Meta and Apple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg started steering his company toward virtual-reality tech, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear he‚Äôs gunning for the same. Meta‚Äôs Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years. 

Facebook is a company that historically hasn‚Äôt shied away from sharing user data with countless third parties. Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn‚Äôt spray your data across the web. And, of course, there‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.

In the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people‚Äôs iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple‚Äôs looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook‚Äôs ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it‚Äôs looking for two product managers who are ‚Äúinspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world‚Äù and who want to ‚Äúdesign and build consumer advertising experiences.‚Äù An ideal candidate, Apple said, won‚Äôt only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with ‚Äúperformance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.‚Äù 

The listings also state that Apple‚Äôs looking for a manager who can ‚Äúdrive multi-year strategy and execution,‚Äù which suggests that Apple isn‚Äôt just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple‚Äôs privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta‚Äôs entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. ‚ÄúIf you talk to any small business, they‚Äôll tell you, ‚ÄòYeah, right now is a disaster,‚Äù said Eric Seufert, one analyst who‚Äôs been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a meltdown. There‚Äôs been a complete, devastating change to the environment.‚Äù

It just so happens that yours truly has about $900 cash in his E*TRADE account (from selling some $INO at a massive loss). I‚Äôm still a rookie investor since 2020, but I think I‚Äôm starting to get my priorities lined up‚Ä¶ Both Shopify and Meta have fallen drastically in the last several months. Looking at these deals to protect and grow my ass-ets!

My primitive investigation into their financial statements (based on Etrade data) for both has me interested‚Ä¶ 

First let‚Äôs look at $META.  
- Revenue growth of 37% in the last year
-P/E of 13
-EPS $12!
-absolutely 0 Debt
- gross Margins of 81%
- 40+ Billion in cash

META looks to have a pretty strong balance sheet, at an affordable price‚Ä¶ 

$SHOP 
- Revenue growth in 1 year of 57% (4.6B$)
- P/E >200!?
- EPS 1 year of 2.29
- about 1.1B$ of debt
- total cash on hand is 7.8B$

My thesis for purchasing the stocks is that there was just 10,000$ dollars of student debt forgiveness provided by the Biden administration. I assume that these student borrowers will use some of their excess cash to purchase things on the Internet, thus paying META and or SHOP, helping them generate revenue. 

I want to know, if you were in my situation would you:
1. Buy META
2. Buy SHOP
3. Hold out because you will think they will fall in the short term and you can get a better deal in the future

w9olze_META,META,Meta earnings are out ‚Äì Here are the numbers,"Meta reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results:

Earnings: $2.46 per share vs. $2.59 per share, according to Refinitiv
Revenue: $28.82 billion vs. $28.94 billion, according to Refinitiv
Meta shares have lost about half their value since the beginning of the year, underscoring investor concern about the health of the company‚Äôs core online advertising business. That unit has been hurt by Apple‚Äôs iOS privacy update last year, limiting Meta‚Äôs ability to track users, and by a weakening economy that‚Äôs led some companies to slash their ad budgets.

Analysts expect Meta to report its first ever year-over-year revenue decline, with sales projected to slip 0.5%. While the rest of the year isn‚Äôt expected to be as bad as the second quarter, analysts are still forecasting tepid growth of 5.6% for 2022 for a company that‚Äôs never had annual growth shy of 20% in its 10 years as a public company.

Meta could be the beneficiary of low expectations.

Last week, Snap and Twitter reported disappointing second-quarter results, and executives cited economic and mobile platform challenges that have permeated the online ad market. The mood soured so much that shares of Alphabet and Microsoft rose on Wednesday even though both companies missed analysts‚Äô estimates on the top and bottom lines.

Microsoft said ‚Äúreductions in advertising spend‚Äù in the quarter resulted in more than a $100 million loss in its online ad business that powers products like LinkedIn and Bing search. At Alphabet, YouTube‚Äôs growth slowed to below 5% from a year earlier, and CFO Ruth Porat said advertisers are pulling back due to ‚Äúuncertainty about a number of factors.‚Äù

For Meta, the story goes well beyond the economy.

Instagram is coming under increased pressure from short video app TikTok. Meta has responded by pushing Instagram‚Äôs Reels feature, which algorithmically surfaces short videos to users.

That shift has come under scrutiny, including from celebrity sisters Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, who criticized the app‚Äôs new direction this week. Instagram head Adam Mosseri indirectly responded by saying in a video shared on Twitter that Meta is working to improve the app. While photos will continue playing a major role, he said ‚Äúmore and more of Instagram is going to become video over time,‚Äù because of changing user habits that favor video.    

Meanwhile, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars a quarter on the metaverse, a digital world that can be accessed via virtual reality and augmented reality devices. The company‚Äôs Reality Labs unit, which is developing the metaverse, lost $2.96 billion in the first quarter.

Earlier this week, Meta raised the price of its Quest 2 VR headset by $100, citing rising production and shipping costs. Although Meta is currently the leader in selling VR headsets, that market is still tiny compared to mobile advertising.

**Brief Bear Case for $META (tl;dr)**:

After ER misses from $SNAP & $TWTR, falling FB & IG App Store metrics, and continued dominance from TikTok, $META puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don‚Äôt have time to read, that means I‚Äôm arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings.

**First, some facts:**

* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.
* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% ‚Äî the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.
* $META shares recently reached a fresh >2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.
* Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20.¬†
   * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 ‚Äî $0.09 above its most recent June low.¬†
   * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 ‚Äî $2.54 above its most recent low.
   * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.
* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758.¬†
* Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.
* The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META‚Äôs pandemic low of $137.10.
* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.
   * On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.
* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta.¬†
   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)
      * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.

>""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

**Conclusion**: Bearish

In the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok‚Äôs continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings this Thursday. However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it‚Äôs critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.

**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads

**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level.¬†

**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it‚Äôs downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.

For July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** ‚Äî Risking $5.00 for a profit of $10.00, breakeven of $165 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move.¬†

**OR**

For July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** ‚Äî Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.

**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts ‚Äî Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it‚Äôs pandemic low.¬†

No matter which trade you pick, it‚Äôs important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position.¬†

**Trade Headwinds**:¬†

* $META‚Äôs earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close ‚Äî directly in between the FOMC‚Äôs next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that‚Äôs a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can‚Äôt afford from a time basis.
* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th ‚Äî right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.

Despite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings.¬†

**The Wrap Up**

Use $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings to target the current >2 year low and an average move of 10.5% ‚Äî OR ‚Äî Target the $137 pandemic low if you‚Äôre looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).

uebtju_META,META,FB/Meta 1Q22 earnings & thesis review,"*Existential crisis averted. DAUs continue to grow +6%, Reels is compounding quickly into a real business, and revenues/GP grew despite Russia. Very cheap at 10x EBITDA & 4.3x revenues.*

I recently promised myself I'd start tracking my large holdings in a similar way to how I track our investments at the office.  Should help with the intellectual honesty.  I figured I'd share it here as well, since its already written, incase anyone is interested:

***1Q22***

Meta reported mixed earnings, with revenues up +6.6% (+10% ex-FX) but EBITDA down -20% YOY on continued headcount investment.¬† The equity reacted very positively to global DAUs being up +6%, blue DAUs up +4%, and Europe DAUs comping negative due to the Russia ban.¬† Notably they expect Europe DAUs to comp down sequentially in 2Q22 due to the Russia ban in March, and global DAUs to be flat-to-down sequentially (but probably up YOY still?) for the same reason.¬† After-hours equity was trading up 18% from the close, at $205, which implies a **10.0x EBITDA, 4.3x revenue, and 13x FCF (7.7% yield).**

While the financials appear mixed, these DAU numbers & some of the mgmt commentary were a huge relief to the market (and to myself! It was a 15% position at the close).¬† A big part of the recent FB drawdown was a perceived existential crisis from TikTok.¬† The TikTok fears have begun to be dispelled, and many other concerns were mitigated on the earnings call.¬† The datapoints below are not supportive of the market‚Äôs narrative that FB was being killed by TikTok:

* The market was expecting negative Blue DAU comps, and a continued deceleration across global DAUs & ad impressions as users switch to TikTok.¬† Instead we got DAUs up +6% and ad impressions up +15%.¬†
   * Reels is also ramping quickly, and Zuck mentioned that Reels are now 20% of Instagram users‚Äô time spent today.¬† Time spent on Reels has a lower ad load today, and it is therefore monetizing at lower rates; however, Sheryl indicated plans to steadily grow the ad load as content quality & user experience improves.¬†
   * I think these DAU stats will help the market better understand that TikTok‚Äôs short form video content is not a direct competitor to Meta‚Äôs current Social apps, and that they can grow together.¬† This is similar to both Meta & Youtube‚Äôs video content continuing to compound simultaneously.¬† They fill different niches.
* Mark also made very positive comments on Reality Labs & headcount investments.¬† *They are paring back on their investment ramp!* Given the current cannibalization by Reels & weaker EU performance, this seems like a prudent way to shore up EBITDA & FCF.¬† He reminded us that they aren‚Äôt lunatics, and actually care about profitability.¬† This will go a long way in expanding the EV multiple.

The thesis here is still intact, and today‚Äôs earnings report did a lot to dispel existential & competitive concerns.¬† I am confident that they will continue to compound Reels into both 1) a formidable competitor for TikTok, and 2) a new & engaging ad surface that contributes positively to FB‚Äôs financials. Reels represents significant whitespace for FB, and should drive the next material leg of revenue growth (20% of time spent on Insta is Reels, with negligible ad load & revenues!).

At 10x EBITDA & 4.3x Revenue, this is still incredibly cheap.¬† 10x to me generally indicates that a company has permanent secular headwinds/declines‚Ä¶and FB doesn‚Äôt fall into that category.¬† I think we will see this get back to a high-teens EV multiple again when both: Reels revenues start to flow & macro/iOS headwinds abate.¬† Keep in mind, FB troughed at 13x EBITDA & 5.6x revenue at the absolute bottom-tick of COVID when the world was ending‚Ä¶and we are a full 3 turns lower than that today.¬† In the meantime, they also managed to buy back 2% of the float in this quarter alone.¬†

To me, this looks like one of the cheapest/safest ways to be long global consumption & inflation, which should drive positive growth until the multiple recovers.¬†",2022-04-29,42,20

suiba7_META,META,Facebook Ads Customer Here. Let Me Tell You Why Facebook aka Meta Will Not Be Back. Former IT Worker and Current eCommerce Owner.,"First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets. 

The reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street).

**I**.	iOS 14.5 Update Impact

1.	Before iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high return on ads spend (ROAS) because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROAS, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROAS as well.

2.	After Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROAS over 500%, my average ROAS on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results.

3.	Effect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance.

4.	TLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB

**II**.	Failing Attempt On Ecommerce

1.	FB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season.

2.	FB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\*\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective.

3.	Supply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period.

4.	TLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it‚Äôs lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income.

**III**.	Tik Tok Challenge

1.	User Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok‚Äôs hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout‚Äôs Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would‚Äôve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy.

2.	Ads Challenge: Needless to say, TT and FB are in the same business, they are big on the advertising business. The difference is their algorithm and method, FB rely heavily on user data since day 1 of their inception. They kept it this way and thought that this will not change, but uh oh, Apple just said FU and shoved a middle finger right at Zuck‚Äôs face. Google is about to do the same soon. TT, on the other hand, also exploits user data heavily but they have come up with new ways to partner with advertisers. Not only do they provide a platform for advertisers to run ads automatically, but they also have partnerships on running organic traffic challenges across their platform for more viral effects. In other words, Facebook lets the advertisers do all the work, rely solely on their algorithm, but TT gives the option of doing work together, this is a big incentive for big advertisers because it will gain an advantage over small advertisers. You can see a lot of video challenges going on TT and a lot of them are events organized by TT to promote for big customers. TT as a new player in town was actually behind FB because TT lacks the data of the worldwide user that FB has been collecting and using for years, but now the loss of these data would put them in the same position.

p.s Google is in the Ads business, too, but their service is inelastic as FB services are more elastic. Also, FB collects data from users, but users provide Google with data voluntarily.

3.	eCommerce Challenge: this is a very important advantage of TT, as you may know, TT has a Chinese counterpart: Douyin in China, they have been exploring e-commerce for years and was wildly successful. Tik Tok Shop is bringing billions of GMV for ByteDance and eating up the market share of top players such as Alibaba and [JD.com](https://JD.com). TT as the global version of Douyin can try and duplicate the success of eCommerce on a global scale. With already established supply chain, vendors, and manufacturer relationship, it‚Äôs easy for them to convince these Chinese Sellers to go global (mind you that global eCommerce is a big industry in China, and the majority of sellers on Amazon are also based in China). Their biggest challenge is logistics. In my honest opinion and reliable sources, TT is doing much much better than FB, they may not have as much user data as FB, but I believe they have more consumer buyer data than FB and they can improve their eCommerce algorithm with these. 

p.s. my former eCommerce partner sells phone cases on Douyin (China) using their Shop and Ads system, their annual revenue is about $30 to $40 million with a 30% net profit margin for years 2019-2021

4.	Other Fields: this is purely my opinion, I used to work in the TMT industry in Beijing with friends and clients from companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance, basically all the big tech companies. ByteDance has a very strong crisis awareness and it is always looking into diversifying its portfolio, they have tried medical, education, gaming, media, entertainment, eCommerce, and enterprise service. Not only do they enter these domains, but also leverage their strength of user traffic to succeed in these fields. In contrast, Facebook purchased Instagram and Whatsapp and contains itself in the social network and advertising domain. Their biggest step out was the purchase of Oculus VR and Meta concept. VR and Meta are nowhere to be profitable soon because of hardware limitations for our era, period (prediction from former executives of Qualcomm, also clients from Huawei, no one in the hardware industry believes in the VR concept, HTC believed in it and look where they are now).

5.	TLDR: Tik Tok is eating up FB‚Äôs market slowly, they are also doing a better job on other domains such as eCommerce than FB did. FB‚Äôs only income is advertising and their services are not inelastic like Google.

It is late here in NYC and I am tired, this is everything I have in mind regarding Facebook. Like I said in the beginning, I am an outsider in the world of Wall Street, I just hope this information I provided can be some help for everyone here. Of course, don‚Äôt just take my words for it because these are purely my personal experience and observation around the industry that I am in. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me, not just for FB. I also welcome anyone who has a different opinion and is willing to explain it.



Edit 2.18.2021

This is to explain why FB is in more trouble than others such as Google and Amazon because someone asked in the comment, also explain how Ads Tracking works
i

FB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.

Let me explain it in detail here,
When you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. 

The Ads-ID was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only know our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).

FB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.

This is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. If they charge a fee people just gonna run To telegram or other messenger apps.

Now let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.

Amazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. I think they failed miserably because they did a horrible job.

Google is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.

Btw, Google and Amazon can identify you and your behavior by your user ID, no Ads-ID is needed for them, especially Google, they can identify you cross-platform such as Google Search, Map. Youtube, Gmail, and any other platform that uses Google Account to log in.

TLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help. Google/Amazon isn't affected much because we actively give data/information to them, they don't need to collect as much data as FB outside of their domain in order to profit so much.",2022-02-17,783,350

smxtg8_META,META,Facebook/Meta price move shows that no individual stock is 100% safe,"It's a lesson that everyone who invests in individual stocks should keep at the back of his mind. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook have been praised on here for many years as stocks that will  outperform the overall market with relative safety. It's very possible that Meta will grow for years to come, and the stock will recover, but at this exact moment:

* Facebook has returned 65% over the past 5 years - not bad, but below the 88% for S&P 500, and the  172% for NASDAQ. Despite the fact that holding a single stock is significantly riskier than holding the index
* The price has been cut almost in half from its ATH. 
* It is trading at its lowest P/S and P/E ratios ever. ""The stock is cheap now, the P/E ratio will return to historical levels"" doesn't always work out. 

Again, not to say that Facebook is a bad business or the stock won't recover, but if it was a big part of your position you're probably not doing too well right now. It just highlights that market dominance over decades is exceedingly difficult. There will eventually come a time when Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Google underperform, start stagnating, missing earnings, and decrease in value.

smaw8p_META,META,Are we prepared for Facebook (Meta) free cash flow to drop 46% in 2022!!?? Nonetheless it is still a buy,"TLDR: Meta free cash flow may drop some staggering 46% in the next year. Nonetheless it is still undervalued, having an intrinsic fair value around 309$ per share. 

Full analysis: [https://youtu.be/7lWlJizZmGk](https://youtu.be/7lWlJizZmGk)

&#x200B;

In the last conference call the CFO announced a sharp increase in operating expenses \~92 bn in 2022 (+30% YOY) along with \~31 bn in capital expenditures (+70% YOY). If you combine this with a \~15% expected revenue growth, it means that margins are going to be decimated. I calculated that operating profits will be -9% YOY in 2022 and free cash flow will be -46% YOY in 2022. Are people pricing in these awful numbers from a company that used to print high double digit growth all around? 

In spite of these terrible predictions, the free cash flow generation is still so high that the stock might still be undervalued: **309$ intrinsic value per share**. Assumptions for the DCF valuation:

* WACC: 8.6%
* revenue growth will slow down progressively to 5% in 2031
* Free cash flow margins will keep at 15.5% for the next 5 years for then increase progressively to 25% in 2031. 
* In 2031 the stock will trade at 17x FCF

&#x200B;

On one hand I feel like the market is not pricing in decrease in operating profits and FCF in the next quarters, and when those number will come there will be a lot of selling pressure. On the other hand, the core business of facebook is such a free cash flow machine that the stock is still undervalued from an intrinsic value perspective.

skmepa_META,META,Is Facebook/Meta's True Value in Messaging?,"Based on recent earnings it seems facebook is losing active users, however the family of facebook users is actually growing. The main reason for the fall is apple privacy change, loss of users on the core facebook platform (though IG and Whatsapp added), and increased competition (presumably Tiktok). However while Tiktok seems to be generating engagement, I don't know anyone who uses Tiktok for dm... They all share it with an other app such as messenger or IG dm. I know telegram and signal are slowly starting to take some of the messaging market but Facebook remains a behemoth in messaging (esp if we include whatsapp outside of the US). All facebook really has to do is go the Tencent route and add integrations to messaging for companies and charge them for it... Is there any threat for this to Facebook?

Part 1 Game Mechanics

Videogame cheat code: When a foreign company reverse merges onto NASDAQ, foreign shorts have to cover their FTDs T+35 after it‚Äôs Options Chain Expires.

Major Point: The SEC doesn‚Äôt care about foreign short hedgefunds like they do American ones. Foreign hedgefunds are fair game.

Example: New Egg (NEGG) and Lianluo (LLIT). NEGG was listed on NASDAQ and LLIT was a Chinese OTC Ticker.

On October 25 2020 when news broke about  the Lianluo Retahd LTD merger with NEWEGG, the stock went from 0.4$ to 4$ the next day, meaning the news caused shorts to start covering. 

Lianluo Options chain ended May 20, 2021. T+35 days later from June 29 to July 7 Chinese shorts closed their position and the price ran from $10 to $79 intraday.

Present Day Example:  Metamaterials and Torchlight energy merger. Same thing, Metamaterials was an OTC-listed Canadian company which inherited HEAVY shorting from a Canadian mining company while Torchlight energy was a NASDAQ listed company.

The legacy options chain for TRCH (currently called MMAT1) ends Jan 21 2022 so expect a spike T+35 days later in early March of MMAT, in addition MMAT is still trading in Canada as ticker MMAX and when that ticker closes and converts to American MMAT, foreign SHFs must close out MMAX FTDs.

Proposed Investing Strategy: Buying promising companies that undergo reverse mergers with foreign companies on the month of Final Options Expiry of the merged company.

Present:
Coming to the merger of Torchlight Energy (TRCH) with foreign Canadian company Metamaterials (MMAT), the options chain for TRCH ends on Jan 21, 2022. I believe that this presents underlying systemic risk to market makers who are naked shorting the stock if my hypothesis is correct.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Closing Point:

If you look at NEGG prior to its ramp up you‚Äôll notice a similar amount of massive shorting. SHFs have a lot more information at their fingertips than retail while we muck about and peer hazily through ‚Äúthe fog of war‚Äù. So it‚Äôs imperative for a SHF to suppress, short and distort the shit out of an actual financial catalyst.

Irrespective of the quality of the company, there will be mass covering of foreign SHFs when the CUSIP # and legacy options chain of a merged OTC foreign ticker officially expires. It‚Äôs unavoidable. In fact, remaining short the foreign ticker while it trades on NASDAQ is a HUGE risk for a foreign SHF as they can no longer manipulate the stock and they will likely be squeezed by American long HFS. That is why Lianluo LTD shorts covered and that is why the Canadian MMAX shorts must cover.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


TLDR: 
In January, stock ticker MMAT is facing four major catalysts that could cause a short squeeze in late Feb/early March:

1. MMAX converting to MMAT, cutting the float in half from 218 million to 109 million and causing foreign SHFs to close out FTDs T+35 days later 
2. An Oilco Special Dividend that could cause an OSTK style squeeze
3. Jan 21 2022 TRCH Options Expiry forcing SHFs to deliver TRCH FTDs T+35 days later in March
4. Investors Buying and Exercising MMAT1 Options through TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, exacerbating the effects of Point 3.
5. Canadians buying MMAX on Baystreetbets can also verifiably reduce the MMAT float as all MMAX shares are registered with the SEC when they transfer over.

I wrote this as a point of academic curiosity. I absolutely DO NOT want people to do this. Rather I‚Äôm interested to see if my hypothesis is correct.

rjsgql_GOOGL,GOOGL,Can TikTok Impact the Bottom Lines for Meta (Facebook) and Google (Youtube)? Is Tiktok an Existential threat for Meta? [I don't think So],"Maybe I do not know Tiktok well enough, but it doesn't have a hook like facebook does to get people to come back. Even though people do not use [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) as much, people are still using messenger for messaging their friends or whatsapp or Instagram. Tiktok is more similar to youtube in this regard in that from my understanding it is not being used as a way for connecting with friends and planning social events, eg ""dinner @ 8, who's in?"" 

&#x200B;

I think it can semi-permanently steal market share from Google, but since their is no hook to get people to come back (like messenger for Facebook), a superior product can come and beat it.

&#x200B;

So While I do believe Tiktok can steal significant market share in the short run from Facebook, Google, in the long run unless they make DM easier, or embed themselves (which they trying to do very hard) in society, I don't think its a long term threat...

This is definitely a good partnership news that will benefit both companies. Microsoft teams is gaining more marketshare as it integrates into other softwares. The partnership could prove most beneficial to Meta as teams could help to boost its Workplace enterprise social network software users. Both stocks should be in the portfolio.",2021-11-12,891,310

qht5z1_META,META,Facebook changes company name to Meta,"Facebook on Thursday announced that it will change its company name.

The name change, which was announced at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference, reflects the company‚Äôs growing ambitions beyond social media.

Over the past few years, the company has ramped up its efforts in hardware, introducing a line of Portal video-calling devices, launching the Ray-Ban Stories glasses and rolling out various versions of the Oculus virtual-reality headsets. The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.

In July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew ‚ÄúBoz‚Äù Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook‚Äôs hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.

Facebook also said this week it‚Äôd spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.

Zuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company‚Äôs ambitions for the metaverse.

The demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves.

**Conclusion**

	Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 

	The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

lgw119_META,META,[META] We are looking for new moderators. (Plus a few notes on the state of the subreddit.),"Good afternoon r/dividends,

The past month has seen an unprecedented expansion in the r/dividends community.  It has been a very busy couple of months. On January 1, 2021, the subreddit had \~65,000 members.  Today as I am writing this, we just crossed 106,000 and we are not slowing down.

With the new year coming along quite nicely, we think it would be a good time to recalibrate and do a little light housekeeping on the moderation side.

First of all, I would like to thank each and every one of our subscribers for continuing to make this a great community for discussion.  Thousands of users come here every day looking for content, and we give them what I believe to be the best investment content on reddit.

I also want to give a massive thank you to every single moderator who has been helping me navigate this incredibly fun time and to keep this internet machine running smoothly.  At the bottom of this post will be a moderator application.  I encourage anyone who is interested to apply.

\------------------------------------------

Beginning ~~on 11 February, 2021 at 12:00am UTC~~ **right now**, applications will open for anyone who wishes to apply to be a moderator of r/dividends.  Applications will be open until the end of February.  If you are using a version of Reddit that supports events, you will be able to follow this post and come back when applications open.  If not, this post will remain pinned at the top of the subreddit until applications close.

Some subreddits take moderator applications on a first come-first serve basis.  Not here.  So long as you apply within the specified period, then your application will be considered on its merits alone. Applications are open to anyone 18+.  The age limit is purely for the liability of the moderators, as we do not want to be sending DMs to people who are underage.

There is no hard limit on the number of Moderator positions to be filled.  Whomever we deem qualified will be put on a list, and as we need more moderators, we will pull from the list.  The only reason for this is because I like to orient new mods personally, on a 1 on 1 basis, and adding everyone all at once would not fit with my schedule.  I want to ensure all new mods are adequately trained and ready to go.  There are some things we do differently on r/dividends versus other subreddits, and I do not want to set anyone up for failure.

I acknowledge that the path to the moon is uncertain and am very put off by the fact that people are knowingly using data that is somewhere between unsourced and wrong to lull others into a false sense of security with the bullish case.

The following interaction just terrified me:

* An OP posted an argument bullish on GME dependent on data inconsistent with Bloomberg
* I commented with the numbers showing on my screen
* They seemed convinced they had the right data and provided a screenshot as a source
* I DMed them to figure out where the inconsistency was, it was far from the first time I'd seen data services have conflicting numbers but I wanted to figure out where the discrepancy was
* They told me they don't know where the number or screenshot came from but provided a link to a financial blog article with ""a time series chart which agrees"" and claimed ""other"" unspecified sources also agreed
* I asked OP to edit their post to mention that they don't know where the number that their argument depended on comes from and that a reputable source had another figure
* They declined
* That post is still up and underinformed people reading it may make decisions that affect their lives based on it

**To be clear, I don't know that the number they provide is wrong but I do know where the number I provide came from and if the number isn't basically 1 in reality it invalidates the OP's entire argument.**

I thought the easiest way would just be to automate entering a ticker into the EDGAR company search web page, but it doesn't work well.  The field accepts more than just tickers, so you can quickly end up on a totally unrelated company's page.  Additionally, the search box has some JavaScript drop-down where you have to actually select one of the results.  Things get really hairy when trying to automate it.

If I knew the CIK of the company I could just go straight to the filings page with https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=XXX, and start scraping, but I don't know the mapping between a ticker and a CIK.  Anyone know how to do that?

Or have any other suggestions?

I‚Äôm looking for suggestions on a good trading platform that can be used for algo trading futures contracts. I‚Äôm not really interested in quantopian (or similar) or to build a stand alone algorithm in python. I‚Äôd like to work within the confines of an actual trading platform that is reliable and easy to work out of. Also I‚Äôm not that interested in Ninja trader - as I‚Äôve read mixed reviews about it and it has that license feee. 

I‚Äôve narrowed it down really to Meta trader 5 or Sierra charts - possibly TT or Multicharts - so if anyone has experience with those or successfully autotrade from any platform - I appreciate it if you could kindly share your experience and suggestions. Many thanks and I appreciate the responses!

Note : my first main algorithm that  I want to make live is relatively simple but pays the bills already - a base long length MA for the  longer term trend , a hull moving average for short term trend,  And a fast zero lag moving average for the signal - all on a 10 minute timeframe with a two candle to multi day hold depending on how price action trails and moves .  (I also have similar  strategies that use other indicators  , bands ,  or candle stick pattern for entries using the same base and mid trend filters but they all are about the same really) If you read the note in my post , you see that what I found is the buy signal is easy to generate - once I qualified the long and mid term tend I get the same buy signal half a dozen different ways to basically the same effect +- 1-3 bars entry signal  - but my zero lag MA signal is the fastest, simplest,  and easiest to qualify on a chart. So it‚Äôs a really basic ,single timeframe , 3 moving average algorithm, with the focus being on the exits and risk management - and I‚Äôve already fleshed that out and backtested and future tested that (by trading along the simulated strategy) as well.  I‚Äôm ready to get this algo working live! I also have range Algos that i want to build too that work well. 

Thanks!!!

Hi ,

Thanks I‚Äôm advance for the help! Not on here much (or online in general - I do go by leakywaders on Stocktwits) so a little about myself: I‚Äôm a seasoned profitable futures and options trader currently using TDA (TOS for charting) and IB. I‚Äôve spent numerous hours  backtesting and coding in TOS (scripting) strategies that emulate my main trading styles with what I‚Äôd consider great success. I enjoy coding and staying up to date with reduced lag formulas - and ways to use indicators to replicate price action trading. While I use very little of that in my trading besides moving averages - I‚Äôm always writing,  coding , or building strategies in TOS as a hobby in conjunction to my normal trading. 


I‚Äôm ready to automate my strategies and am looking for guidance on a good platform that allows automation. I feel I have the confidence and the technical  abilityto pull it off successfully though time will tell. I also believe with what I‚Äôve done,  finally automating my trading will eventually pay dividends and significantly reduce labor while increasing trading opportunities. So I ask for some guidance in getting started. Thanks! 


So does anyone use a platform to auto trade? Any advice or recommendations? I‚Äôd rather maintain charting and normal order entry functionality and really don‚Äôt want to write some standalone program. It would be nice if for platform  had some sort of server side execution - though I could run a VPS. It would be ideal to be able to monitor , execute discretionary trades , or manage positions from my phone/tablet as well. I do have accurate text alerts in TOS that I will continue but having text alerts for order entries , exits,  or strategy signals would an additional plus coming from the new platform so I know it is running properly. Basically I‚Äôm looking at MT5 , Sierra Charts, or TT in no particular order but I‚Äôm open to anything that works well and is reliable. So I appreciate the help and hope others have had success auto trading futures. 


Thanks for the help and good trading to you! 

###=====###
A little about where I‚Äôm at with my strategies and experience to anyone interested - What I‚Äôve found is an entry signal is rather easy to generate and I have several completely different algorithmic ways to signal a buy /sell of a pullback in a trend or to find range reversals - the exit is the meat and potatoes of the coding efforts but that comes down to basic risk management - volatility based static stops and targets , trailing stops and targets , and a logical conditional exit. Coding when to switch is a slight challenge but I have that where I want it - Rarely does the conditional exit execute - but my volatility targets/stops are what I exit on instead. The interesting thing I‚Äôve found is my exits remain roughly the same no matter the entry - so the entry needs to be acceptable , early, win more times than it loses.  The losses have to be smaller than the winners and when both are true one is consistently profitable. It‚Äôs not difficult to do when I‚Äôm trading and my coding that now runs along side my live trading does the same to an acceptable degree (less profit per trade, some loses that are obviously not very good trades to take - but still decent and not worth throwing more code at it until I switch over and actually way more profitable  since it can trade 24/5 and enter immediately and at all hourss).",2020-06-07,6,0

The Trend Scanning idea from Marcos Lopez de Prado, is released in his newest book here (free DL until May).  He first mentioned it earlier last year, and added a few code snippets in his [book Machine Learning for Asset managers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545).

MLdP code snippets are sparse, likely to fit it on printed page, so I added docstrings to make it easier to see (see link [here](https://github.com/decisivealpha/DecisiveML/blob/master/trendscanning.py))

Trend Scanning is not a trading model in itself, but extended to form a model. A few ideas for a trading model:

* Classify trend for recent history. If probability of ""long"" is > 50% and your entry signal is long, enter. Exit with your favorite stop loss method.
* Classify trend for two products, e.g. S&P and Gold. Enter on S&P crossover, exit when Gold trend changes
* Use ""t1"" output as a feature for meta-labeling (i.e. a lagged trend as a feature)

It looks like it‚Äôs been a busy day for Meta Growth, in terms of press releases ([here](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/meta-growth-provides-update-on-ontario-roll-out-865280811.html), and [here](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/meta-growth-announces-10-0-million-bought-deal-offering-to-expand-its-retail-footprint-in-ontario-843877955.html)).

As far as I can tell the good news is that Meta Growth is looking forward to opening more stores, and the bad news is that another capital raise required to move forward with additional store openings will be dilutive.

In terms of trying to suss out the potential value of new stores on a [Sales Per Square Foot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sales-per-square-foot.asp) basis, specifically related to the new store located at [378 Yonge Street in Toronto](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&ved=2ahUKEwivjLjTmpvnAhUPy1kKHekFBqgQFjAKegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages4.loopnet.com%2Fd2%2F-Tvemi0hfW_bszxB6f6vxgb1zqtEa9yKC4lK6cecyj0%2Fdocument.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2LIBd9pEShDc8tgxhBfMEU), I thought it would be worth the effort to review figures in the most recent [Investor Deck](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meta-Growth-Investor-Presentation-JAN-2020.pdf) (P. 9) and compare those to the reported figures in the [annual report](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf) to see if everything‚Äôs on the up and up, so to speak.

eqrco9_META,META,"Meta Growth / NACNF ‚Äì A Price to Sales Comparison including HITI, ISH, and FAF","Hi Everyone,

I thought it might be worth the effort to post a comparison of Meta Growth (META), High Tide Inc. (HITI), Inner Spirit Holdings Ltd. (ISH), and Fire and Flower Holdings Corp. (FAF) based on a [Price-to-Sales ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp) to see if it might provide any interesting information, since they‚Äôre all retail companies.

Revenue Assumptions

Meta Growth is the only company that has filed an annual report for this year as of this post, so the ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù figures for the other 3 retail companies in my sheet are based on the following averaged calculations:

META = Total Reported Annual Revenue of CAD 54,101,660 as of August 31, 2019. [(P. 5)](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf)

HITI = Net Revenue of CAD 8,288,000 for the 3 months ending July 31, 2019 / 3 = 2,762,666 per month x 12 months = 33,152,000 [(P. 7)](https://hightideinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3Q19-Financial-Package.pdf)

ISH = Total Revenue of CAD 3,991,640 for the 3 months ending September 30, 2019 / 3 = 1,330,546 per month x 12 months = 15,966,560 [(P. 3)](https://innerspiritholdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Interim-Financial-Statements-Nov-21-2019.pdf)

FAF = Total Revenue of CAD 13,699,728 for the 13 weeks ending November 2, 2019 / 13 = 1,053,825 per week x 52 weeks = 54,798,912 [(P. 3)](https://wp.fireandflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/FF-FS-Q3-2019-v15-for-Sedar.pdf)

Outstanding Share Count and Stock Price Assumptions [(VWAP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp)

I‚Äôve read the most recent financial reports for each of these companies and, to be honest, it just got too fucking complicated to cite figures from each report because they‚Äôre all reporting on different timelines and different reporting schedules, etc. ‚Äì so I decided to use the consolidated information available from [The Marijuana Index](https://marijuanaindex.com/) because (after a few comparisons) the figures on the site seem pretty close to what each company has reported (in terms of outstanding share count).

Regarding the Stock Price, I chose to use the [Volume Weighted Average Price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp) (as reported by The Marijuana Index) at the close on Friday, January 17 because the VWAP price represents the ratio of the value of a stock traded against the total volume traded over a particular time horizon (usually one day). I think it‚Äôs a better stock price quote since some of the debenture holders who receive shares in lieu of interest payments often lob in bullshit sell orders for one or two shares every now and again to manipulate the price of the stocks in question. (Ask me about that later)

Anyway, and without any further ado, I present you with the following Price to Sales Ratio comparison:

eqc4ia_META,META,"Meta Growth / NACNF ‚Äì A Look at Store Count, Revenue, and Price per Sales Ratio","Hi Everyone,

It‚Äôs Friday night and I‚Äôve been chewing on the most recent Meta Growth [financials](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf) and [MD&A report](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-MDA.pdf) because I‚Äôd like to look at how store count relates to revenue, and how that figure might inform a Price per Sales Ratio for the company.

According to page 17 of the [MD&A report](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-MDA.pdf):

‚ÄúAs at August 31, 2019, the Company had 30 retail locations in operation, with 9 operating in Manitoba, 20 operating in Alberta, and 1 operating in Saskatchewan.

As legalization occurred on October 17, 2018, this is the first fiscal year in which the Company operated retail cannabis stores. The stores opened throughout the year as follows: October ‚Äì 4 locations; November‚Äì 13 locations; December ‚Äì 3 locations; January ‚Äì 3 locations; April ‚Äì 1 location; June ‚Äì 1 location; July ‚Äì3 locations; and August 2- locations.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the store count as mention above:

|Month|Store Count|% of Total Store Count|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018-08-31|0|0|
|2018-09-30|0|0.00%|
|2018-10-31|4|13.33%|
|2018-11-30|13|43.33%|
|2019-12-31|3|10.00%|
|2019-01-31|3|10.00%|
|2019-02-28|0|0.00%|
|2019-03-31|0|0.00%|
|2019-04-30|1|3.33%|
|2019-05-31|0|0.00%|
|2019-06-30|1|3.33%|
|2019-07-31|3|10.00%|
|2019-08-31|2|6.67%|
||30|100.00%|

According to Page 5 of the [Consolidated Financial Statements](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf), Total Revenues for the year were CAD 54,101,660 which includes Cannabis Sales, Merchandise and accessory sales, Commission, and Other revenue. (ie. CAD 286,060 of revenue from ‚ÄúMedical Cannabis Education‚Äù in Q4. (see [P. 16](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-MDA.pdf)))

On a macro level it would seem CAD 54,101,660 / 30 stores = CAD 1,803,388 per store for the year. (That would be about CAD 150,278 per month, and about CAD 37,569 per week (on average)).

However, when I looked at the store count at the end of Q1 it seemed like a very large chunk of revenue for the entire year (about 43%) could be accounted for by the 17 stores that were up and running at the end of November, 2018.

With this in mind I decided to go back and look at reported earnings for each quarter to see how the quarterly reported revenues might be related to the annual reported store count.

Here‚Äôs the updated sheet with those figures:

|Month|Store Count|% of Total Store Count|Quarterly Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018-08-31|0|0||
|2018-09-30|0|0.00%||
|2018-10-31|4|13.33%||
|2018-11-30|13|43.33%|$3,787,228.00|
|2019-12-31|3|10.00%||
|2019-01-31|3|10.00%||
|2019-02-28|0|0.00%|$16,202,100.00|
|2019-03-31|0|0.00%||
|2019-04-30|1|3.33%||
|2019-05-31|0|0.00%|$17,045,769.00|
|2019-06-30|1|3.33%||
|2019-07-31|3|10.00%||
|2019-08-31|2|6.67%|$17,066,562.00|
||30|100.00%|$54,101,659.00|

And with this in mind I thought it might be interesting to look at the percentage of total annual revenue, on a store count basis over the year, which brings us to this sheet:

|Month|Store Count|% of Total Store Count|Quarterly Revenue|% of Total Annual Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018-08-31|0|0|||
|2018-09-30|0|0.00%|||
|2018-10-31|4|13.33%|||
|2018-11-30|13|43.33%|$3,787,228.00|7.00%|
|2019-12-31|3|10.00%|||
|2019-01-31|3|10.00%|||
|2019-02-28|0|0.00%|$16,202,100.00|29.95%|
|2019-03-31|0|0.00%|||
|2019-04-30|1|3.33%|||
|2019-05-31|0|0.00%|$17,045,769.00|31.51%|
|2019-06-30|1|3.33%|||
|2019-07-31|3|10.00%|||
|2019-08-31|2|6.67%|$17,066,562.00|31.55%|
||30|100.00%|$54,101,659.00|100.00%|

According to this sheet it looks (to me) like the real engine of the company‚Äôs revenue resides in the 17 stores that were up and running at the end of November 2018.  Granted that reported revenue per store appears to lag on a per quarter basis, it still seems (to me) as though the 17 stores that were operating in Q1 could be responsible for a large chunk of the company‚Äôs overall revenue for the year... which is not a bad thing considering that Meta Growth owns 100% of New Leaf Emporium and 100% of The Green Company, among many other subsidiaries. (ie. P. 10 of the [Consolidated Financial Statements](https://metagrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Q4-2019-Financial-Statements.pdf)).

So what about the Price to Sales Ratio you may ask?

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp)

|Market Cap|$57,060,950.00|Shares Outstanding|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|$54,101,659.00|184,067,581|0.31|
|P/S Ratio|1.0547|||

With this in mind it seems like a fair value might be closer to CAD 0.58/share:

|Market Cap|$106,759,196.77|Shares Outstanding|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|$54,101,659.00|184,067,581|0.58|

As we all know, **everyone must do their own research,** come to their own conclusions, but let me just shed some light.

&#x200B;

Stock trading at a fairly discounted price of 0.65 as I write this. This puts them at a market cap of 119.3M. 

&#x200B;

Now they are the leading private cannabis retailer in Canada with 20 stores (just in Manitoba and Alberta) and plans to open up to 150 in 2019. Obviously that's not guaranteed, but they're on a white hot pace.

[https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/national-access-cannabis-becomes-canadas-largest-private-recreational-cannabis-retailer-by-store-count-leading-the-country-with-17-stores-700995511.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/national-access-cannabis-becomes-canadas-largest-private-recreational-cannabis-retailer-by-store-count-leading-the-country-with-17-stores-700995511.html)

Their strategic partnership with Second Cup, a company with lots of real estate in Canada but continuously falling revenue, surely can't hurt their ambitions to open 150 stores in 2019. Basically, it gives Second Cup franchise owners that are eligible (given their location, permit availability, etc.) the option to convert their Second Cup store into a META dispensary.

&#x200B;

On top of the recreational retail, they originally started out as a medical distributer, and they are now in partnership with 111 pharmacies across Canada.

Since retail MUST buy from the OCRC - it eliminates any benefit for being an LP and owning retail since the central distribution model requires wholesale cannabis to be sold to them, and retailers subsequently MUST buy their flower from the OCRC.

Best case scenario is then having a retail op that is 100% focused on retail and replicating their process. Enter META.

9fbu0o_META,META,Metacash (META) - Hidden Gem for Clever Investors," 

Metacash is one crazy explanation, but anyone who understands the simple math will want to invest in this project.And anyone who does further research will understand why this one is with hodling!

Lets go!

Metacash is a pure POS coin with 120% p.a staking every year. The premine is being distributed over a year long airdrop. It is currently in round 3 of 28 of the ""Hold & Earn"" Airdrop (Drop is every Sunday 10PM GMT) before moving into the ""Last Rain"" and completing the supply distribution.

The premine is ONLY 5% of the total supply. The rest of the supply is mined at 120% POS. Lasting an estimated 9 years.

The total supply is a low 30 million with 1.5 million premine. Currently only 132 000 coins are in circulation. All coins not in circulation are NOT staking. End of airdrop supply is estimated 1.9 million META.

Now that we have looked at some technicals lets look at the supply distribution (airdrop)

First of all you must join the meta discord and hold a minimum of 100 META in a wallet. Register with discord name and wallet address on the website.

Hold & Earn:+ 4% of wallet balance per airdropped per week.

While to some this may seem low to those who know compound interest they will find this results in +199% more META at the end of the 28 week long airdrop. (i.e buy 1000 have 2999 at end of airdrop)

But wait? What about that sweet POS?

When one factors this in we find that the gains are +434% more META! (Buy 1000 have 5434 at end of airdrop)

Now lets address exactly what you thinking... ""This many free coins, wow its just gonna be dump!""

Well, first of all yes, there will be dumps, just like most crypto. But when you realize the small size of the supply and plan to hold through the dumps you can land up with a very large chunk of the supply of META. If more people hodl (required for good airdrops) we will see great price action even during the airdrops. Remeber the 120% POS is every year. Hodling this coin will remain profitable for a long time!

""Okay, you convinced me, those are pretty good numbers!""

Nah hold up mate, it gets better! If you buy and hold certain amounts of meta you can join the whale clubs for extra % rewards. See discord for more whale club info!

And don't forget about ""The Last Rain"" This airdrop will be 4% of wallet balance per week increasing by 1% per week until all coins are distributed!

Okay, pwew, lots of number, but we got through it!

""So, what does this coin do?""

Well this is a transnational fully green coin with a wallet and payment ecosystem. The Andromeda wallet is the flagship project for 2019. This will be a multi-currency, multi-operating system wallet with social integrations. Allowing for things such as coupon creation and sending as well as name specific addresses (@John#453771)

They will also be deploying an autonomous add servicing agent, multiple block-chain tools for meta and much more.

I do beleive this coin will be successful. But, even if it isnt, even if the price dumps more than it is now (its stupidly low @ 400 sats for a low supply coins) you still make great money. I believe this could be a 2$ coin. If in a year and a bit time the circulating supply is around 2 million and with a good bull run this could be easily 4 mil m.cap

The time to get in is now, many people dump free coins and the price is low. HODL and you win the game :P

7xbal1_META,META,"[META] Someone had an idea of doing a reading group with The Intelligent Investor, and somewhere along the way it didn't happen. This sub should have more investing directed activities. What should we include that isn't us talking about Vanguard 24/7?","I'm a scrub when it comes to this whole investing thing. I know I am but I go here a good amount to learn how to be a better investor. I had my hopes up about the reading group one user was going to do with The Intelligent Investor and it didn't come to fruition. Which is sad because the minds on this sub are incredible but a lot of the threads that come up here are littered with answers related to ""Vanguard index funds"", ""ETFs"", and I'm so fucking happy we're not seeing a lot of cryptocurrency posts anymore but that was a big one also. 

Investing, as far as my schmuck mind has gathered, is way more than just dropping money in index funds and ETFs and funds of various other goals. It, much to the chagrin of a lot of the people who do respond with the aforementioned responses such as ""Vanguard"", ETF, etc., includes picking individual stocks. Rallying around passive investing is good, yes, but let's be real for a good minute here: Are we going to listen? If anything some of you readers might be holding blue-chip stocks. Which is fine, but I want to know WHY you own them and have the ensuing discussion revolved around investing methods. So we can all learn why you picked this, hopefully not just because it's a blue-chip stock, but because there's a concise valuation you found within reading about the company that led you to believe your money would be best suited going to that company.

Let's create discussion around various methods of investing, picking out current and past investors and analyzing their methods, reading groups. I know I'm only getting started with this investing journey but my god its my money and I want to take it more fucking seriously than ""Vanguard"", ""ETFs"", ""buy and hold"", ""bitcoin"", and simplistic answers.

What do you think? What direction can we push the investing discussion(s) to? Where should it go? Where would you like it to go?",2018-02-13,109,49

388jct_META,META,Meta: Lingo,"Hey all,

I have been more or less lurker here, trying to gain as much as understanding of this wildly complicated subject through osmosis. One of the hardest parts of 'keeping up with the conversation' is the lingo. I was wondering what the more experienced folk here thought of creating a sidebar entry (probably under the FAQ header) which outlined some of the basic lingo, the basic ideas, etc... to help keep the conversation flowing - while allowing the hangers on to the conversation keep pace.

In my mind this could be anything used in common parlance. From the simplest ideas like 'Blue Chips' and 'YoY' to acronyms like EFTs, OTC, stock jargon like 'Sell put' and even down to more complicated short hands for bigger ideas - today for example I read the phrase ""what the fuck. that is a synthetic long. you basically longed the underlying."" (thanks /u/dunningkrugerpin!) which also made me say ""what the fuck"".

Basically, I wanted to see what people thought about having an accessible lingo guide (mostly so I can have it open on my second monitor) to help the growing community of investors ~~leach~~ learn from the this sub's most active communicators. I'm not really in a spot where I can pull that kind of list together, without requiring too much time in research, but some people here know investing like the backs of their hands (it seems).

3597ik_META,META,[META] Should we do something about wrong information being posted on this sub?,"I know investing is always caveat emptor and investors should always do their own due diligence, but the amount of misinformation being thrown around on /r/investing is ridiculous. Off the top of my head I remember:

* Debt underwriters guarantee debt repayments.
* Interest expense shows up on the income statement only when it is paid.
* Liabilities are the same as debt.
* A company's stock price is reflected on its balance sheet.
* etc...

My issue with this kinds of stuff is that they're often given as answers to someone who is actually making the effort to learn about investing and they end up learning the wrong things, which could potentially be harmful. The people who posts these kinds of things are often so confident about their answers even though the ones asking the questions seem like they know more than those answering them.

I would like to get some feedback from the participants here on enhancing the rules a bit (opening them up more on the do's side towards business questions in algorithmic trading (e.g. how much is my stuff worth? regulatory/compliance q's? contractual/pay ? taxes? ) and other topics that may come up.
