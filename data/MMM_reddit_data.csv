1k7yd0d_TSLA,TSLA,SCHD and Dividend ETFs/Stocks are only for Old Guys? (23M),"Hello, 

  
I am a 23 year old, I've been investing for a few years now (but not as much as I'd liked to as I had school and other things going on - so I'd pick up the odd dividend stock here and there before, and especially not many additions in this last year unfortunately due to other commitments, maybe a few hundred dollars max in the past year until this month) but this recent stock market fiasco showed me that it was again a good buying opportunity and reinvigorated me to getting serious about investing again as I once was. So I am not longer on auto pilot, and am again fully committed to seriously investing into the stock market for my future. Subsequently, going forward on any income I make, I'm now committed to putting a serious percentage of that away into the market. And I did buy some dividend stocks (like O) and ETFs (like SCHD) on sale during the recent downturn.

I've been hearing lately though, as I get back into these investing forums, that a young person such as myself should not ""waste my time"" with dividend stocks, instead focusing on growth (VOO, VTI come to mind) (I do have 0.25 shares of VOO from the recent sale). That I would be better focused on long term growth instead of hitching myself to dividend stocks. 

  
With that said, dividend stocks are the things that get me excited when it comes to investing! They are the reason I started investing at all a few years ago! I like having the little money producers, slowly working in the background, the snowball effect, getting paid to hold something tangible like that. And owning realty ETFs or companies like O are like my version of property rentals (since I won't have an apartment or house for the foreseeable future).

  
So I am curious, am I wasting my time putting money into dividend stocks at this age, or should I go all in on the snowball effect and DRIP? Or maybe some of you have a more reasonable plan, like 50/50 or 75/25 either way, let me know what you think because dividends excite me and I want to get involved NOW and not just when I'm older and nearer to retirement. I realize one's investing strategy is up to themselves and no one else, but I am curious to what other similar age (or older investors who were investing since my age) think on owning dividend stocks this young. Thank you!",2025-04-25,1,22

1jf0v68_META,META,Final Weeks For Getting Payment From MMAT $3M Investor Settlement,"Hey guys, we all know about the Torchlight situation that ended up in a lawsuit against Meta Materials some time ago. Well, I got some updates and I decided to share it. 



Quick recap: A few years ago, Meta Materials got caught up in controversy over the Torchlight deal. Issues with their products and accusations of overpricing led to an SEC investigation and a wave of lawsuits from investors.



Last year, they finally agreed to a [$3M settlement ](https://11th.com/cases/meta-materials-shareholder-settlement)to resolve the case. The update is that they’re accepting late claims for a few more weeks until they start preparing payment distribution. So, if you missed the original deadline, you can still check the details and file for payment.



Anyways, has anyone here had $MMAT when the Torchlight scandal happened? If so, how much were your losses?",2025-03-19,0,1
1ijrvhh_GOOGL,GOOGL,BlackRock-backed ($3m+) biopharma $FBLG loading for potential 2x run with likely catalysts by 12 Feb,"*UPDATE:* With the SP now swinging between $1.8 and $2 risk involved in this investment for those looking to enter has substantially increased. Exercise extreme caution if buying in at these prices. There could be significant pull-back at EOD or moving into next week if the catalysts which I predict **may** happen do not actually happen.

**FOREWORD**

*I have written DDs for RVSN, SPRC and MGOL. Each one has done 100%+ since it was called.*

**Full report:** Found on my profile or the Montgolfier Reddit as a Google docs - this subreddit does not allow links. I strongly recommend reading it before you make an investment decision, aside from doing your own due diligence.

*-------*

**Overview:** $FBLG is a stock that appears to have bottomed out at \~$1.60, an opportunity capitalised on by global investment firm BlackRock which has purchased a huge $2,871,952 worth of shares in the last week Alongside a SEPA and option awards with exercise prices at $2.41 and $2.381 respectively, there is universal confidence that $FBLG will soon reverse its downwards trend, likely triggered by the upcoming catalyst on the 10th/11th February.

**Upcoming catalyst:** Fibrobiologics has announced that they will be presenting “research & development updates” at an investor conference on the 10th and 11th February, alongside an in-house analyst day. We expect that these developments will serve as catalyst-level news flow, triggering a potential gap up to $3 or beyond. 

* **BlackRock Investment:** On the 29th and 30th December, BlackRock purchased $2,871,952 shares worth *(at around $1.6 per share)* of Fibrobiologics. On the 29th and 30th January, there was more unusual activity, perhaps indicating a follow-up purchase from BlackRock as there were large volume spikes on the 1m candles, in tranches of 250,000 and 500,000.
* **YA II SEPA:** Similarly, Yorkville has entered into a $25m value SEPA with Fibroliogics, with rights to exercise their promissory notes at $2.381 *(whereas current SP is 1.605)*.
* **Employee options:** Moreover, the board has been awarded its largest ever option awards with exercise price at $2.41: the CEO was awarded 406,339 shares.

**Low downside:** With a comfortable bottom seemingly established at $1.50, entry between $1.50 and $1.70 offers the opportunity for investment at very low downside risk, for potentially huge upside.

*If there is no news from the investor conferences, consider exit.*

We believe that the company strategy is to “pump” the share-price through the newsflow, which they will then seize advantage of by drawing on their shelf offering, exercise the SEPA, and exercise their options whilst the SP is favourable. As a result, the risk of dilution will continue to increase as the SP rises; this means that an exit strategy is crucial.

1gyfxw9_MCD,MCD,McDonald’s Espresso Machine Meltdown: $193M Burnt Nuggets or Billion-Dollar Golden Arches Play?,"This is weird. 

McDonald’s (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. 🍮 A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait—it gets worse. If they don’t fix this fast, this could be McDonald’s ice cream machine scandal 2.0—with espresso.

The Drama
You know how they’re always like, “Sorry, the ice cream machine’s broken”? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald’s had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some “unspecified safety concern.” I mean, who’s getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen’s third-degree burn from asking for “extra hot”? 🔥☕

The Numbers
Here’s where it gets wild, fam. McDonald’s serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	•	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	•	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	•	That’s $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	•	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

Total burn? $193M. That’s nearly **13% of their quarterly

1gvgwk5_MMM,MMM,MMM Adjusted Options,"Hi Folks, 

I had a quick question concerning MMM adjusted options due to the spinoff of SOLV last April. 

I understand each share of MMM received .25 of SOLV. So 100 shares of MMM equals 25 shares of SOLV. 

The new options contract for MMM reads 100 (SOLV 25: 20.0)

If I sold a covered call before the adjustment on MMM, does that mean that the 25 SOLV shares I received from the spinoff cannot be sold before the MMM shares are exercised since they are needed for the assignment of the covered call? 

Any insight is appreciated! ",2024-11-20,0,1

But in case you missed it, I just found out that they are accepting late claims, so you can still file to get payment even if the deadline has passed. 



Long story short, a few years ago Meta Materials was involved in a scandal with Torchlight deal due to claims of exaggeration about their business ties and product innovation (and they were also accused of overpricing). After all of that, they got investigated by the SEC and also hit with lawsuits from investors.



The good news we got early this year was that they finally agreed to pay a $3M settlement to solve this scandal. But now, I found out that they´re accepting claims even after the deadline.

1bt9qxy_DE,DE,$PDFI is a DeFi co w/ a $3m mcap (CAD),"$PDFI on the CSE — Prophecy Defi — $3m mcap holding BTC miners & altcoins 

This is only listed on the CSE in Canada so it has limited exposure. Last closed at 2 cents — $2.66m CAD market cap. It’s touched 5 cents earlier this year but there is always one house suppressing the price by selling millions of shares. 

132 million shares outstanding and limited dilution since early 2021 private placement. Late 2021 as crypto bear market set in they raised over $5 million in convertible debentures — with shares convertible at 60 cents.

They got skinned right after the raise, dropping from 0.60 to 0.005 into late 2023 when crypto plummeted and shorts have been in control ever since. They had $1m liquidity in Ronin during the Katana exchange hack in 2022, since recovered. Made a lot of changes to their team, and held onto altcoins during the bear market.

As of Sept 30, 2023 they had 700k in cash, $1.8M in digital currencies assets, over $500k in various publicly traded BTC miners. Digital currencies likely worth 2x minimum with altcoins surging.

Looking at house positions since late 2023I think there’s millions of shares naked shorting this right now. Anon and BMO are roughly net -12 million shares. The CEO is a former investment banker and managed at trading firms. He’s bought over 3 million shares on the open market in the past year. One of their directors was co-founder of multiple investment firms who had successful exits. 

There’s a board on ceo dot ca if you search PDFI you can find more discussion and do your DD. The company has been silent since December so many are anticipating news soon. 

This isn’t advice, just my opinion,  I see a big opportunity building here leading up to the halving. Look at the chart in 2021 during the last crypto bull run. I bought this at 0.025 and I’ll be holding this post-halving, as they mentioned financial updates are coming.

3M (NYSE: MMM) notes in the filing that separating the two companies brings benefits, such as the ability to tailor their investment decisions to drive growth, allowing management to focus on strengthening core businesses, improving operational agility and better accessing capital by creating distinct investment profiles that appeal to different investors.

The stock price has been in the negatives for the last five years, and I'm not sure if there's a bottom in sight right now. I would write it off to avoid, but I keep coming back to that tasty-looking 5.29% dividend rate.

You think it would be worth throwing a bit at now to growth later, waiting a while, or avoiding entirely? I'm looking at adding some more dividend seeds to my portfolio.

Edit: This seems to be generating a mixed bag of thoughts and opinions, and I'm enjoying watching the discussion. I'm currently thinking I'll let it hang on my watchlist to see how the heftiest litigations shake out - and to see if revenue growth is maintained.

Based on what we see in our end markets, we will reduce approximately 2,500 global manufacturing roles - a necessary decision to align with adjusted production volumes.""

10fceaj_MMM,MMM,Why don't investors seem to like 3M (MMM)?,"I am just an amateur passive investor in it for the long haul and am certainly not a financial investor. Full disclosure I do have a very small portion of my investments in 3M (\~2.4%).

Maybe I'm missing something big here, but why does it seem like there is such negative sentiment towards owning 3M? It operates in a relatively stable environment (Industrials) and has had consistently yielded EPS over consensus and has a very strong dividend (4.7%, but long history of paying dividend). It even has above-average ESG for the sector and from looking around its balance sheets, nothing jumps out at me as a sign of a declining business.

I understand the amount of free capital floating around in the beginning of the pandemic leads to an overvaluation of stocks across the board, but this stock seems to be mis-valued. Or maybe I'm completely blind to something here in which case I would appreciate any help in understanding the cause of 3M's steady price decline. Thanks!",2023-01-18,538,177

Lawyers for the soldiers have demanded the right to continue taking their cases to trial. The ruling means 3M now faces the prospect of jury verdicts from around the country, with one expert hired by the soldiers’ law firms estimating the company could face more than $100 billion in damages from the claims.”

…

Damn … I may just sell out at a 20% loss and accept I made a bad call buying this one. It hurts a lot and I try to never sell anything but this company is hurting bad and I don’t think it was trending upwards even before recent trouble.

MMM obvious legal issues, but for a value investor this is a dream come true (as of today it's rocking over a 4% div yield) I have been buying a share or two every other week slowly lowering my DC on it as I don't think it's going bankrupt or out of business and has just temporarily fallen out of favor with investors as it navigates through these rough legal waters.

Well, the outlook for 3M isn’t great. Realistically how will it affect their business? — They will most likely stretch out every case as far as possible. Appealing over and over again. Resulting in a push to a settlement agreement with all the victims.

If we historically look for such lawsuits against Big Tobacco, Bayer, VW, Bank of America or BP for example, they all took a big hit, but recovered over time.

t96d4t_MMM,MMM,3M (MMM) Extreme Dip Buy Candidate,"First off: this is a trend analysis, not fundamental analysis, and it's just my particular method of looking for extreme dip buys.  I screen on fundamentals before I run any of these numbers on a company.

10-year trendlines:  MMM is currently below both its linear and exponential 10-year growth curves by a significant amount.  2 standard deviations below would be a price target around 136 (currently about 5% above). Its current downward deviation from trend is the 2nd largest in the past 10 years (the largest being the COVID crash).

PE ratio: Its current PE ratio of 14.17 is the lowest it's been in 10 years, with a mode (nearest integer round) of 17 and mean of 21. 2 standard deviations below mean is a PE of 14, so this basically puts it at the PE price target.

200-weekly MA Deviation:  Currently at around -20% deviation from its 200 weekly. This is the 2nd largest downward deviation in 10 years (again, the largest being the COVID crash). Again, at/below target.

Miscellaneous considerations: [Revenue is relatively consistent over time.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MMM/3m/revenue). [EPS also relatively consistent.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MMM/3m/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted).  And since ""safe"" stocks with a solid dividend yield seem to be the current vogue (outside of energy, commodities, and defense), it has a 4.16% dividend yield [with a solid history of increasing dividends.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MMM/3m/dividend-yield-history).

I'll admit the chart looks terrible, and the current general market environment doesn't look great, but in the past 10 years, the only better time to buy was the COVID crash.

*Company Overview:*

$MMM – 3M Inc. is a global, diversified technology company that operates in the following businesses: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3M develops their products in -house, and thus has an unusually high product development, and research and development costs.

3M operates in 4 main business segments, which include: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. These business segments appear on some of their quarterly and annual financial reports, and their performance in each of these segments will be discussed later.

***Investment Information:***

*Recent SEC Filings:*

In this section, I will summarize 3M’s most recent SEC filings to help you get an idea of what is currently going on in their business.

· SpinCo Merger (Reverse Morris Trust Transaction) 8-K Report:

o On December 13th, 2021, 3M sold one of their subsidiary companies (“SpinCo. Corp.”) to Neogen (one of their subsidiary companies “Nova RMT Sub Inc.) 

o 3M’s SpinCo is a food safety business, and the transaction implies that it is worth $5.3B (USD). 3M will retain 50.1% of the SpinCo subsidiary, and Neogen will assume the other 49.9% stake in the subsidiary.

o This transaction “Reverse Morris” allows for a tax-free transfer of the SpinCO subsidiary, which is beneficial for both parties involved.

· Q3 2021 Financial Report:

o $8.9B in sales (7.1% YoY increase)

o $2.45 Earnings per Share 

o Free Cash Flow of $1.5B (decreased by 29% YoY)

o $1.4B in dividends distributed, and shares repurchased.

o Updated guidance for sales growth by 2%, and decreased their EPS guidance by $0.20/share

· Departure, Election, or Appointment of Officers (8-K):

o On October 15th, 2021, 3M appointed Eric Hammes as the Executive VP and Chief Country Governance Officer. Eric joined 3M in 1997 and has held several leadership positions in the finance, accounting, manufacturing, and supply chain segments of 3M’s business.

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· **$HON – Honeywell International:** Honeywell International.is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. Its Aerospace segment offers several electronics, software, physical parts, and power units to their clientele in the aviation business. Honeywell’s Building Technologies segment offers applications software, switches, and electronics that assist in the building and construction industries. Its Performance Materials and Technologies segment offers automation control, software services; catalysts and adsorbents, equipment; bullet-resistant armor, nylon, and computer chips. The company's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment provides personal protection equipment, apparel; cloud-based notification/emergency messaging; software solutions; and custom-engineered sensors. 

· **$GE – General Electric:** General Electric operates as a high-tech industrial company. The company's Power segment offers gas turbines for utilities, power producers, and industrial applications; steam power technology (boilers, generators etc.); and reactor technologies. This segment services may industries, such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals, test systems, and water. GE’s Renewable Energy segment provides various solutions for onshore and offshore wind, blades, hydro, storage, solar, and grid solutions, and hybrid renewables. The company's Aviation segment designs/produces commercial and military aircraft engines, integrated engine components, electric power, and mechanical aircraft systems; and provides aftermarket services. Its Healthcare segment develops, manufactures, markets, and services various medical devices and software. The company's Capital segment offers aviation leasing and financing and working capital services; financial solutions and underwriting capabilities; and insurance products.

· **$EMR – Emerson Electric:** Emerson Electric Co. manufactures technology/engineering products for industrial, commercial, and consumer markets worldwide. The Automation Solutions segment offers measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control software and systems. It serves the oil and gas, refining, chemicals, power generation, life sciences, food and beverage, automotive, pulp and paper, metals and mining, and municipal water supplies markets. The Commercial & Residential Solutions segment offers residential and commercial heating and air conditioning products, monitoring equipment and electronic controls for gas and electric heating systems. 

· **$PH – Parker-Hannifin:** Parker-Hannifin Corporation manufactures sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. The Company's Diversified Industrial segment offers sealing, shielding, thermal products. Filters, control solutions, and electromechanical components. Its Aerospace Systems segment offers products for use in commercial and military airframe and engine programs, fuel systems and components, pilot controls, and wheels/brakes. 

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, 3M’s net sales essentially remained constant, however, they were able to decrease their operating expense by 3.6%, which helped to contribute to a higher operating income and a higher operating margin. Additionally, 3M was able to increase their net income in 2020 by 18% which is very high, and their EPS ended the year at $9.32 (up from 2019’s EPS of $7.92).

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, 3M’s Transportation and Electronic segment’s revenues decreased by 8% and represents their only declining segment. However, within these segments the Abrasives, Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Oral Care performed the worst, declining 15%, 17%, 16%, and 19% respectively.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net income by 0.3%, which might not sound good, however, considering 3M’s operating income decreased in this time period any increase in net income is great. Furthermore, 3M was able to keep their EPS (basic and diluted) constant during this time, which is again good considering their decline in operating income.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net sales by 7% YoY, now you may be wondering “how is this bad”? Well, during this same period, 3M increased their operating expenses by 11%, which contributes to a lower operating margin. This can be seen by their YoY decline in operating income of 6%

· **Share Repurchasing:** In the first 3 quarters of 2021 (Jan 1 – September 30th), 3M reported repurchasing 6,675,484 at an average cost basis of $190.88/share (totalling $1.27B worth of shares repurchased). This would have increased the value of existing shares by approximately 1.2%, which is a great sign for longer term investors.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing 3M’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following: 

*PE Ratio:* 

Based off of 3M’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $MMM should be valued at $232.72/share, which would imply a share price increase of 29%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/B Ratio:*

3M’s P/B ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $143.52/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 20%. This is a little low and contradicts the results achieved via the P/E comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

3M’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $174.82/share, which would translate into a small downside of 3%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Based off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $183.69/share, which would imply an increase of 2%. This indicates that 3M is very close to their fair value.

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $MMM stock of $205/share, which implies a potential upside to this investment of 14%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that 3M is sitting at/around their fair value and has a little bit of room to run up.

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with 3M’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find 3M’s fair value to be $203/share, which implies an upside of 13%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that 3M is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $MMM stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $MMM stock of $197/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $MMM stock would go as follows: 

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $180/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially the 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual) reports).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking). If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",2022-01-06,103,47

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· **$HON – Honeywell International:** Honeywell International.is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. Its Aerospace segment offers several electronics, software, physical parts, and power units to their clientele in the aviation business. Honeywell’s Building Technologies segment offers applications software, switches, and electronics that assist in the building and construction industries.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, 3M’s net sales essentially remained constant, however, they were able to decrease their operating expense by 3.6%, which helped to contribute to a higher operating income and a higher operating margin. Additionally, 3M was able to increase their net income in 2020 by 18% which is very high, and their EPS ended the year at $9.32 (up from 2019’s EPS of $7.92).

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, 3M’s Transportation and Electronic segment’s revenues decreased by 8% and represents their only declining segment. However, within these segments the Abrasives, Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Oral Care performed the worst, declining 15%, 17%, 16%, and 19% respectively.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net income by 0.3%, which might not sound good, however, considering 3M’s operating income decreased in this time period any increase in net income is great. Furthermore, 3M was able to keep their EPS (basic and diluted) constant during this time, which is again good considering their decline in operating income.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net sales by 7% YoY, now you may be wondering “how is this bad”? Well, during this same period, 3M increased their operating expenses by 11%, which contributes to a lower operating margin. This can be seen by their YoY decline in operating income of 6%

· **Share Repurchasing:** In the first 3 quarters of 2021 (Jan 1 – September 30th), 3M reported repurchasing 6,675,484 at an average cost basis of $190.88/share (totalling $1.27B worth of shares repurchased). This would have increased the value of existing shares by approximately 1.2%, which is a great sign for longer term investors.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing 3M’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following: 

*PE Ratio:* 

Based off of 3M’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $MMM should be valued at $232.72/share, which would imply a share price increase of 29%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/B Ratio:*

3M’s P/B ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $143.52/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 20%. This is a little low and contradicts the results achieved via the P/E comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

3M’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $174.82/share, which would translate into a small downside of 3%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Based off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $183.69/share, which would imply an increase of 2%. This indicates that 3M is very close to their fair value.

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $MMM stock of $205/share, which implies a potential upside to this investment of 14%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that 3M is sitting at/around their fair value and has a little bit of room to run up.

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with 3M’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find 3M’s fair value to be $203/share, which implies an upside of 13%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that 3M is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $MMM stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $MMM stock of $197/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $MMM stock would go as follows: 

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $180/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially the 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual) reports).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking). If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",2022-01-06,99,47

If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",2022-01-06,59,54

Observation

Novation Companies, Inc. OTCBB $NOVC Board is controlled by Barry Igdaloff, JD, CPA ex Dynex Capital NYSE $DX Board member of 20 years (per DX 8K 9/3/20). Igdaloff & his college friend Todd Emoff, both told me 10 yrs ago they owed Fortress Wesley Edens, COB big time for helping them take $DX from pennies to $10/shr pre 3:1 reverse split so DX could join NYSE under MREIT exemption. Today they collect .13-.15/share Monthly Common Dividend. 2000-03 they took $DX (DX is where 2 of 3 NOVC Founders worked Scott Hartman, Lance Anderson, before joining ex Smith Breeden Michael Bamburg) from pennies with $120M NOL to 10 pre reverse split as today DX trades at 20/share per reverse split thus trades at less than the DX share price when Fortress sold 100% of their Capstead Mortgage $CMO which owned DX. 

I was asked by Igdaloff to ID new investors, so he and Fortress could control NOVC Board. I did so via Whitney Tilson, WT Kase Cap - I introduced WT Small Cap Guys Chuck Gillman, Jeff Eberwein (JE is ex G Soros PM and ex Viking Global PM) Nov 2014. I was not on the call but by Spring 2015 Igdaloff and Gillman/Eberwein had control of NOVC Board and by end 2015 removed CEO Lance Anderson, his mentor Gregory Barmore ex Head of Genworth GE Mortgage Insurance Top 100 executive under Jack Welch, ex CEO of GE) and two of their appointees. Your observation is correct Igdaloff, and ex DX investors Howard Amster control the Board of NOVC along with 3 appointees of Gillman/Eberwein: David Pointer, Lee Keddie, and Tim Eriksen. 

Here are 3 key moves I am trying to get NOVC Board to do:

1. Disclose the truth that same investors own both all of NOVC only Sr Debt via CDOs (Fortress/Taberna CDOs I & II & EJF Capital/Kodiak CDO One aka Note Holders), and at the same time, also own Common Equity Shares 27% 31.3M shares in ""Schedule of Beneficial Interests"" in 10K and 10Q. The must also disclose $DX investors Board Members Barry Igdaloff, Chairman of NOVC Board and Howard Amster (BI and HA) have a very successful past relationship with NOVC largest Note Holders Taberna I and II owned by Fortress Wesley Edens via $DX.

2. NOVC Board should disclose their future plans these experts (Manny Friedman, Wesley Edens, Mass Mutual and DX investors ex Board Members) have for CCR per SRTA Sec 5.04 attached to back of Q3 2007. These plans can use collateral assets on most of NFI aka NOVC $3B portfolio are material. If they have no plans, they should go on record in SEC docs. NOVC CEO and CFO and Board mislead Mr. Market by disclosing only CCR value (page 25 of 2020 10K) cleanup call rights per Sec 5.04 of SRTA. The omission of these plans while referencing the value of CCR is subterfuge and misleads Mr. Market. Boulay Group Top 200 AICPA CPA firm is aware of these points and must restate at least NOVC 2020 10K filed 3/4/21 at SEC.

3. If NOVC Board led by Barry Igdaloff have been grossly negligent (paying Note Holders Fortress/EJF Capital est $11M interest in Ch 11 and post Ch 11 and 31.3M common 8/19/19 for no cram down (reduction in face value of Sr Debt) they should step down.

If as I believe they have colluded with Note Holders led by Wesley Edens, COB & CEO of Fortress aka Taberna CDO I & II well they should be transparent. How can NOVC Board have successfully restructured other organizations just to lay waste and fail to disclose a plan to restructure Novation Companies, Inc. OTCBB $NOVC especially when they misrepresent future plans for $730M NOLs and plans for CCR cleanup call rights per SRTA Sec 5.04. These investors NOVC Board restructured Dynex Capital DX with Note Holders Fortress & Fortress very successfully restructured very similar public companies to NOVC including [www.driveshack.com](http://www.driveshack.com/) $DS formerly traded Newcastle Inv Corp ex $NCT which separation into 3 MREIT SNR, (sold last week for 2.3B) GCI and NRZ [www.newresi.com](http://www.newresi.com/) (NRZ 2020 10K shows Fortress cashed $170M in $NRZ management fees for 2019 alone). NOVC Note Holders Wesley Edens, Manny Friedman have led and restructured many MREITs including OMF, COOP aka Nationstar, IMH and FBR.",2021-07-07,2,1
myxrml_CRM,CRM,OVTZ Raises $3M in Funding and Announces GA of Forget-me-Yes Privacy Platform,"Oculus Visiontech (OVTZ) has two major events that happened since last market close on Friday: Raising 3 million USD to further the development of Forget-Me-Yes, and General Availability of Forget-Me-Yes.

Forget-Me-Yes is a SAAS service that helps companies deal with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. These laws stipulate that persons have the Right to be Forgotten, Right of Erase, and others and can file a request at any time. **Companies then need to erase all data related to that person within a limited time window**, like 30 days. **Non-compliance fines are huge**. The **customer might be a long-time relation that has generated lots of revenue for the business, or it might just be a passing cold called person from a database that has never generated any revenue. Regardless, the laws apply and average processing fees of such a RtbF/RoE request are calculated as $1,406.00**. 

This is not a passing fad, privacy is a growth business. Ask Gartner: [https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-key-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-legal-and-compliance-technologies-2020/](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-key-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-legal-and-compliance-technologies-2020/).

Business model of the SaaS service: The first version of FMY that is now released focuses on a **Salesforce extension with monthly subscription fees**. This is a brilliant move, as Salesforce is the de-facto standard of CRM software for the globe, and locking in monthly fees via this platform should be very sticky. Of course, more is needed and **my conversations with OVTZ revealed that there is a roadmap for integrating with more technologies**. Forget-Me-Yes can query Salesforce to find personal data for removal, and can support manual search and removal as well. It's case-based, with clear case progress statuses from start to finish. However, there basically is no state in which the business can lean back. Data is copied everywhere. Recovering an old backup? The personal data might return. Importing a spreadsheet? You get the point...There is a need to keep searching for removed data to make sure it stays removed. (keeping the search terms themselves is allowed under the law, as ""operationally necessary"").

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 26, 2021) - Oculus VisionTech Inc. (TSXV: OVT) (OTCQB: OVTZ) (FSE: USF1), an emerging data compliance innovator, through its brand, ComplyTrustTM, today announced general availability of ""Forget-Me-Yes™"" (FMY) a data privacy solution. General Availability status allows Oculus through its brand ComplyTrust™ to emerge from a pre-revenue company to a company actively marketing and selling its services.

""Forget-Me-Yes™"" (FMY) is ComplyTrust's Software-as-a-Service application for organizational and individual Right-to-be-Forgotten (RtbF) and Right-of-Erase (RoE) data privacy compliance. The Forget-Me-Yes™"" Zero-Knowledge platform provides single-source capability of continuous compliance by incorporating automated policy-driven re-query services that guarantees a Data Subject's requested RtbF/RoE data remains 'forgotten' over the life of their FMY subscription.

Forget-Me-Yes™'s B2B cloud-native microservice and infrastructure-agnostic architecture, is now available on a monthly subscription-basis for Salesforce organizations, supporting both structured and unstructured data queries. According to [Gartner's 2020 Hype Cycle for Legal and Compliance Technologies](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/4KxVTE1VN), the average cost to manually process a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) is $1,406.00. Forget-Me-Yes™ is cost-effective insurance to ensure DSAR deletion-request compliance for Brazil's LGPD, California's CCPA/CPRA, Europe's GDPR, Nevada's SB220 and Virginia's CDPA data privacy legislation.

[Matt Leib](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jMQGtk75P) of International Data Corporation (IDC) says ""Today's world and changing laws along the lines of the European [GDPR](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vQPphe4Rp) mean that we have control over whether our information is even held within an organization's environment. Our right to remove this data is ensured by GDPR, as well as newer iterations of this regulation across the world. Placing that request obligates the organization to remove it. However, there are methods by which that data can creep back in. Oculus VisionTech's Forget-Me-YesTM platform ensures the organization not only removes all traces, but consistently monitors the dataset such that should this data creep back in, it will once again be removed. In this way an organization can not only comply with the regulation, but remain in compliance.""

""We are pleased to announce the Forget-Me-Yes™ product launch initially under the global AWS cloud infrastructure, providing our B2B customers with an elastic, resilient, scalable and secure platform for CCPA, CDPA, GDPR, LGPD and SB220 data subject privacy compliance management"", said Michael Johnson, President and co-founder at ComplyTrust.

""The Forget-Me-Yes™ data privacy platform is both a cost-effective and innovative solution that equally protects data subjects, data collectors and data stewards alike in the worldwide data privacy compliance landscape"", added Rowland Perkins, CEO and President at Oculus VisionTech.

**Points of interest:** After the Google and FIS filings, SSFT did NOT put out formal PR’s pumping the deals etc. Most OTC stocks would have never shut up about huge named deals like that. Why did they stay so quiet?

Well, it would seem they are more concerned with building the business/company than pumping their stock. Breath of fresh air. They would have most likely had to file NDA’s with those giant companies and also they would want to keep their dealings under the radar as to not tipoff the competition (my views)

After the 8-K filings and subsequent Audited $13.33M in revenue announcements, the Company went silent and the stock flew under the radar for months despite the huge deals in the works. 

**Finally, on Dec 30, 2020: SSFT** provided annual update which described its AI tech, its strengthened AI Engineering and Management teams**, a deal with a “multi-billion-dollar financial services company”,** and I think possibly most importantly – **Announced they had filed a patent to protect their Intellectual Property relating to their AI tech.**

The patent filings as well as the deal with the multi-billion-dollar financial services firm (I am assuming that is $FIS) explains why the Company was so quiet over the past 6+ months. They were working on a huge deal with cutting-edge technology – both of which needed to be kept quiet to protect the deal (my opinion obviously)

Following the December 30 announcements, the market began to slowly catch on and trading volumes and price started to really pick up. Sentiment and interest on message board has significantly increased as well.

Then, most recently on January 28th 2021 – SSFT announced yet another key patent filed for its AI tech. Once again strengthening their position and protecting/increasing shareholder value even more.

**Moving Forward:**

So, what is next for SSFT? Well, investors are speculating we could be waiting on details relating to the Google or FIS deals, further patents, or new deals with other big named companies (they already have a long list of big named clients).

Further, the fact that FIS and Google chose SSFT as their AI tech provider speaks volumes about the efficacy of the tech. And now this tech is in the process of becoming IP protected / Patented which could add significant value to the company.

In previous Press Releases, the company has mentioned intentions to up-list to higher exchanges (Nasdaq) and also that the steps it is taking would make SSFT an attractive buyout candidate by a larger company.

The RedHat buyout by IBM comes to mind from a couple years ago. Investors woke up one morning to learn that RedHat was getting acquired for $34 Billion 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-its-34-billion-acquisition-of-red-hat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-its-34-billion-acquisition-of-red-hat.html)

With the current climate in the OTC Markets and stock market in general with companies like AITX and TSNP running up to hundreds of million $ and even BILLION $ market caps (while having BILLIONS of shares outstanding) – I think $SSFT with their relatively tight share structure, $13M+ audited revs, and huge current deals with major companies has a great shot at running into the dollars from its current price of 0.18/share.

Of course, DO NOT take my word for anything. I’m just pointing out what I like / think and my opinions. I am just letting people know they might want to investigate this one and do some DD/Research.

I welcome any thoughts / feedback.

kdf4gv_AMZN,AMZN,"Relfection on three trades from today, on accidental 3M charts. Happens. 1 winner and 2 losers $AMZN $NVAX $TSM","Today was interesting, mainly because I unknowingly made the rookie mistake of trading off of the 3min chart instead of the 5m. I didn't catch it until tonight when I came back to review trades. I do like the 3min for open, but I have been skipping open for a few weeks now and am mostly a 5m/10m/1h chart trader. 

&#x200B;

[$AMZN 3m](https://preview.redd.it/9c8ktqkb1a561.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8a3ad363c3cbac9300ba891138b3dc8aa635d9)

$SPY was heading lower and $AMZN was flagging after being rejected for a second higher high on lower volume. MACD down, Stoch down, RSI down. I drew a few trendlines to help my decision, but unfortunately was not quick enough to get my stop limit set and entered with a stop (I put stops for entry in initially because is that is how my default brackets are set up, I then edit them to stop limits for better fills (sometimes no fills)). My fill as bad as there is a large spread on $AMZN.  I took profit below VWAP for 2R and some change, with more not ideal fills. 

[TSM 3m](https://preview.redd.it/qghxunlz3a561.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=66894088dd4cdfc36816073686dc7739eb670e8b)

This one I saw price wicking support on increasing volume. I entered at the break of support / pre-market highs but also due to the 3m chart I assume, I was over anticipating the move and couldn't get my stop limit in so bad fill again. MACD turning up but choppy, stochastic up, RSI ranging. I put my stoploss below my entry bar since the fill made my R:R trickier to make work, I would have needed an 80c for 2R if I put my stop under the lowest recent wick and 20EMA cloud where I originally planned. I didn't see TSM making a huge move today just a pop with the way the market was performing. I was stopped out, for a small loss, In hindsight I should of just left this ticker alone due to volume, or traded short for the midday fade after the lower low / triple top. 

[NVAX 3m](https://preview.redd.it/ahew5ukd5a561.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3f0fcd48bbf3878f56effdb650011d3b6ea48a)

Same deal, drew trends that made sense to me. Took $NVAX short on the break of the trend, my stop was 130.30. We actually hit 2R on this trade, but I had my limit to cover at the red line (prior support from yesterday and personal approx 6R target), which wasn't hit until later. A good lesson for me, because I put this trade on and then headed to work and was stopped out. When AFK it may be better to trail my trades instead of stop/limit if I am going for above 2R targets. That way my stop is automatically moved to breakeven. I haven't decided how to handle this, as I generally have bad luck with trailing stops. The reason I was going for 6R is just that I chose to trade a technical target instead of R and I had a short bias on $NVAX for today, which happened to be 6R. I always make sure each trade has the potential to move to at least 2R but I prefer 3R+ with ideal entry. If I was at my computer I would of scaled out 1/2 or 1/4 at 2R. Oh well.

3M has been beaten up because of the trade war and slow down in the Asia Pacific. However, MMM may be finding a support from a hidden trend line, and the stock could be looking for a bottom. In addition, indicators are starting to show bullish divergences which means the bearish momentum is slowing down, and possibly reversing. Even though the trade war is ongoing and the global economy is slowing, 3M's stock price could be finding a bottom, signaling investors are bullish on the future of the economy. The trade war has new rules, but the company has had time to adapt, and 3M is a 117 year old company that has been through many types of economic cycles.

9yfy9a_MMM,MMM,Volume Divergence on MMM ?,"I'm new to this sub and to day trading in general. I've been spending quite some time understanding technical analysis. Can ya'll tell me if I'm reading this right.

If you look at the $MMM 1 year chart you can see that after the low of October 22nd price started moving up pretty rapidly, however the rate of change of volume is still pretty stagnant (bottom most chart). I have read that increase in price without volume confirmation is a good sign of a bull trap. Is this correct analysis here ?

&#x200B;

When looking into 3M it seems to have a relatively high P/E at 24.5 yet it seems as if revenue since 2012 has been steady at 30 Billion.  While it has increased dividends and income (I believe through increase in margins) this does not seem sustainable to me.

&#x200B;

There appear to be a few downsides in the longer run including tariffs, talks about increases wages, and oil price increases which seems to all negatively affect the company.

All I've been doing is going to [biopharmcatalyst](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com) and finding biotech stocks with upcoming news, filtering out any bigger than Small Cap stocks, and researching prior trial results.  I [found ZGNX on Sept 21st](https://imgur.com/jxJjR7l) with this process, saw that phase II trial results absolutely killed it, and ended up slowly accumulating it into news.

I find this to be one of the more safe methods of extremely volatile trading

2t7sv8_XOM,XOM,Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends $MMM $XOM $PG $UGI $ARLP $GLP,"Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends

The best-known collection of stocks that keep increasing dividend payments is the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

This is where you’ll find blue chip dividend stocks like 3M $MMM), Exxon Mobil $XOM and Procter & Gamble $PG … stocks that have given investors annual dividend increases for at least 25 years in a row.

There are two other things a stock needs to be an Aristocrat… a market cap of at least $3 billion and average daily trading volume of $5 million.

Those are some serious hurdles, aren’t they?

This is why the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats get so much attention.

But what about the stocks that grow dividend payments that don’t have heavy trading volumes, and aren’t huge companies with big market caps?

Here’s where to go find them.

Here are four great places to find stocks with growing dividends, and each one of them flies under the radar compared to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 

The Dividend Champions – These are like junior versions of the Aristocrats. The Dividend Champions have raised dividends for the past 25 years, but they don’t have to be an S&P 500 stock. And there are no liquidity requirements.

The Dividend Achievers – These stocks have increased dividends for the past 10 years, and the liquidity requirements aren’t tough. Daily trading needs to be above the $500,000 mark.

The Dividend Contenders - Just like the Achievers, these stocks have raised dividends every year between 10 and 24 years. Unlike the Achievers, there are no liquidity restrictions… the stock does not need $500,000 worth of trading every day.

The Dividend Challengers - These stocks have raised their dividends between 5 and 9 years in a row.

Now that you know where to find stocks that have a history of raising their dividends every year, here’s how to get the breakthrough you need for your portfolio.

It’s all about balance. It’s a simple lineup of different kinds of dividend stocks that offset strengths and weaknesses.

1b2qhc_GS,GS,Buffett to take 9.3M share position in GS instead of exercising warrants,"During the panic of 2008 Buffett came charging in (blood on the streets) and made some big investments.

The deal he gave GS in order to save their collective asses was that he would buy $5B worth of preferred stock and also get $5B in warrants that allow him to buy another $5B worth of common stock.

Needless to say, things have worked out pretty well since then.

>Almost five years later, as the warrants reach expiration in October 2013, the parties have amended the deal from the right to purchase 43,478,260 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, with an exercise price of $115, to ""the number of shares of common stock equal in value to the difference between the average closing price over the 10 trading days preceding Oct. 1, 2013 and the exercise price of $115 multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrant (43,478,260).""

>In other words, if Buffett exercised his warrants at $115 on Tuesday, when shares trade for $146, he would make a $1.35 billion profit. Instead, Goldman would give him approximately 9.23 million shares of the company - the equivalent value of cash, except in shares. Depending on the price in October, the deal will likely place Buffett as a long-term, top 10 shareholder in Goldman Sachs and make it approximately 12 or 13 th largest holding. Sachs' largest fund owner is value guru Dodge & Cox .

>""We intend to hold a significant investment in Goldman Sachs, a firm that I did my first transaction with more than 50 years ago,"" Buffett said the statement.
