1jot9zs_MRNA,MRNA,Do biotechs like Moderna or Pfizer stand a chance in the current administration?,Under our current administration with billions of cuts taking place I feel like there may not be much budget left over for biotechs. We have come all the way around in both Moderna and Pfizer. They both still have an excellent pipeline with huge potential and a great dividend. I would like to make it a portion of my portfolio but I’m unsure how to proceed. Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts. Thanks in advance,2025-04-01,15,13

1ipmhfx_MRNA,MRNA,"Bridgewater is Betting on TSLA, Dumps GS and Buys More MRNA","Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, made a notable shift in its investment strategy late last year, increasing its stake in electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla while exiting positions in major companies like Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology.

According to Bridgewater’s latest 13-F filing, the firm purchased $62 million worth of Tesla shares, representing a 0.28% stake in the company during the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla stock experienced a post-election rally following the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, largely due to CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with the new administration. By the end of 2024, Tesla’s stock had surged 62%, but 2025 has proven more challenging, with shares already down 12%, amid concerns over slowing sales and Musk’s increasing involvement in other ventures.

Meanwhile, Bridgewater also expanded its position in Moderna, the vaccine manufacturer, acquiring 605,782 shares for a 0.12% stake. At the same time, it completely exited investments in Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology while drastically reducing its holdings in Applied Materials, a semiconductor company. The hedge fund further trimmed its exposure to consumer staples, cutting stakes in CVS Health and Tyson Foods, signaling a strategic shift in its portfolio.

1ia0vxm_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna (MRNA) opinion,"Hi everyone,  
I’d like to share my analysis of Moderna (MRNA) and get your thoughts on whether it might be undervalued in the current market. Despite trading at stock price levels similar to the pre-COVID era, Moderna’s financial and technological situation has transformed dramatically over the past five years.

**Key Points of Analysis**

1. **Market Value vs. Financial Growth**
   * **Assets and Equity**: The company’s assets and equity have grown approximately tenfold, driven by profits accumulated during the pandemic.
   * **Cash Reserves**: Moderna’s cash has grown significantly, from \~$1 billion pre-pandemic to \~$9 billion today.
   * **Enterprise Value (EV)**: Adjusted for debt (which has not grown substantially), the current EV is far lower compared to early 2020.
2. **Technological Advancements and Brand Growth**
   * Moderna has developed and commercialized revolutionary mRNA technology, initially used for the COVID vaccine but with potential applications in a wide range of medical treatments in the future.
   * Over the past five years, the company has enhanced its internal know-how, acquired new machinery, and significantly grown its brand reputation in the biotech industry.
3. **Valuation Disconnect**
   * Despite these advancements, Moderna’s stock is trading at a lower valuation (EV Basis) than it was pre-pandemic.
   * The likely reason for this discrepancy seems to be a current lack of interest in the pharmaceutical sector rather than fundamental weaknesses in the company.

**Questions for the Community**

* Do you think Moderna’s current valuation accurately reflects its financial and technological growth?
* Could this be an overlooked opportunity in the biotech space, or are there risks not immediately apparent in its financials or pipeline?

Looking forward to your insights!",2025-01-26,6,4

1i4dx6l_MRNA,MRNA,MRNA bird flu play,"Hey all! Hope your weekend is great and your money is making you money. I believe there is a good opprotunity this coming year with Moderna (MRNA). 

The premise: Current bird flu cases are upticking in some areas. While the transmission to humans is slowly happening, I actually don't think this is where the big money even is. The real money is going to be in getting the animals vaccinated themselves. In an article from October of 24, the USDA said this: 

[https:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/news\/agency-announcements\/usda-builds-actions-protect-livestock-public-health-h5n1-avian-influenza#:\~:text=In&#37;20addition&#37;2C&#37;20USDA&#37;20continues&#37;20to,are&#37;20currently&#37;20undergoing&#37;20field&#37;20trials.](https://preview.redd.it/fjk10yo9fsde1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c94b7d998858310cbbb264b26d9fb51e1784398)

So we are in a situation where there are candidates being developed for H5N1 (bird flu). Now Je te presente Moderna:

[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/healthcare-pharmaceuticals\/us-awards-moderna-590-million-bird-flu-vaccine-development-2025-01-17\/](https://preview.redd.it/ypjfiupxfsde1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=21eb0cdaa01edcd2b6c1e71aba28daf56bde3bc5)

  
Now there is actually some back story to this in that the HHS previously awarded Moderna $176M back on July 2nd 2024:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-awards-moderna-176-million-produce-bird-flu-vaccine-2024-07-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-awards-moderna-176-million-produce-bird-flu-vaccine-2024-07-02/)

while this wasnt a big splash in July, the situation of bird flu in the US wasn't either. But we are seeing an uptick going on:

[https:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/livestock-poultry-disease\/avian\/avian-influenza\/hpai-detections\/commercial-backyard-flocks](https://preview.redd.it/utd4unv0isde1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=cecf3a4246866c75130fc0125d78a828bcbf2667)

  
This report is as of Jan 16th (about halfway through the month). Thus the idea here is that you see cases rising quite a bit on a month over month basis. Should this keep progressing, it will become more of a problem. The problem straight away is food prices rising due to more scarcity. This said, how does the govt make problems go away? It throws money at companies and they find a solution.

Here is where we are since:

Moderna itself in terms of its price and historical action is fairly risk off I would say. At this point I would presume anyone big interested in selling has surely sold, afterall what are you waiting to sell for if you still got the bag? Afterall we are back to these Feb/March levels:  


So who knows for sure. Maybe it finds a way to drill even lower, but considering the current situation, I'm skeptical and only see upside potential here. One good headline and all the negative nancy's have to flip to bullish boldilocks. Best of luck out there. ",2025-01-18,5,34

1h1yuwt_MRNA,MRNA,I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027. They've also been making huge jumps in the last week due to a [bullish sales view](https://www.investopedia.com/moderna-stock-jumps-following-bullish-sales-view-at-healthcare-conference-8750059).

1gy9heh_MRNA,MRNA,Mrna looks a little undervalued ,"Was looking at MRNA heating up a lil bit off its low this year around 35.80. 1st winning week on decent volume too. Have to go back to about April of 2020 for these prices. But just in general it seems to be trading way off its averages. 

My thought is that the new administration won’t be as anti vax as medias make them out to be and MRNA will do just fine if not better if regulations open up. 

I don’t know much about their pipeline or approvals but looking at doing some 6 month call strikes and building the position on weak days for better price.

# Moderna Is Feeling A Bit Sick…

**Cost Cutting Mode**  
Moderna’s getting out the scissors. The biotech giant announced plans to cut its R&D budget by $1.1 billion over the next three years as it faces the harsh reality of slumping vaccine sales. The company is pulling the plug on five programs and slowing down late-stage trials to rein in costs. Translation: it’s aiming to survive the post-COVID world by focusing on 10 key product launches by 2027. But there’s a catch—Moderna’s break-even target just got pushed back two years, from 2026 to 2028.

**Investors to Moderna: Not Impressed**  
Wall Street took one look at that plan and said, “Nope.” Shares tanked over 12%, marking a rough day for a stock that’s already down 20% this year. While Moderna claims it’s exercising ""financial discipline"" by scaling back, investors are skeptical. They’re wondering if this is less about discipline and more about desperation. The company’s revenue projections for next year didn’t help either, coming in way below analysts' expectations. Some are questioning whether Moderna can make it to 2028 without asking for more cash from shareholders.

**So, What’s Next?**  
Moderna is betting big on 10 new products, with vaccines for flu, RSV, and a combo flu-COVID shot leading the charge. The company’s pipeline also includes some cancer treatments, but fast-tracking those approvals has hit a snag with regulators. Still, Moderna is pushing forward, expecting these new launches to drive growth. However, don’t expect any major cash infusions until at least 2025—revenue contributions from these new products are likely a couple of years away.

**The Bigger Picture**  
This isn’t just about tightening the belt. Moderna’s once high-flying COVID vaccine sales have fallen to earth, forcing the company to recalibrate. Its COVID cash cow dried up faster than expected, and competition in the vaccine space is heating up. Now, the company is left navigating a landscape that’s looking a lot less certain. CEO Stéphane Bancel insists that they won’t need to raise equity, but investors aren’t convinced.

  
Moderna’s “pivot” may sound like a savvy long-term strategy, but in the short term, it’s raising a lot of eyebrows. With revenue projections looking iffy and product launches still a few years out, the biotech darling has some convincing to do if it wants to regain Wall Street’s trust. Until then, it’s all about survival—and cutting those R&D costs is just the beginning.

# Oracle’s Big Cloud Dreams — $104 Billion Sales by 2029

Oracle has its eyes on the clouds… and a lot of cash. The software giant just upped its forecast, predicting at least $104 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029, thanks to the rapid growth of its cloud infrastructure business. This ambitious target was laid out by Executive VP Doug Kehring during Oracle’s annual analyst briefing, where the company also raised its fiscal 2026 sales outlook to $66 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.5 billion.

**Cloud Wars Heating Up**  
Oracle’s game plan? Keep expanding its cloud services to compete with the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The company has been gaining traction in cloud infrastructure, particularly with generative AI workloads, boasting high-profile clients like Elon Musk’s xAI. Oracle’s strategy also includes making its database software easier to run on rival platforms—a move it hopes will help migrate its on-premise customers to the cloud, a key pillar of its growth strategy.

**The Numbers Game**  
Oracle’s stock is having a banner year, up 55% so far, trailing only Nvidia among the tech giants. Shares jumped another 6% following the updated revenue forecast, capping off a good week that saw the stock surge 15% over three trading sessions. CEO Safra Catz was confident about hitting these targets, citing partnerships with cloud heavyweights like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to help boost Oracle’s cloud revenue, which has already grown by 45% in the latest quarter.

**Eyes on AI**  
Oracle’s not just riding the cloud wave—it’s betting big on AI, too. The company announced it’s taking orders for a massive cluster of Nvidia’s next-gen GPUs, which could solidify its place in the AI race. And as capital expenditures are set to double in fiscal 2025, Oracle’s banking on both cloud and AI to keep the revenue train rolling.

# Adobe’s AI Ambitions Stumble — Guidance Misses Mark

# By the Numbers:

* **$5.5B - $5.55B**: Adobe's revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, falling short of analysts’ $5.6B expectations.
* **8%**: Adobe’s drop in extended trading after the guidance miss.
* **11%**: Increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.41B.
* **$4.65**: Adobe’s third-quarter profit per share, beating estimates of $4.53.
* **$550M**: Net new digital media subscriptions, slightly below the $561M forecast.

Adobe has been busy rolling out AI tools like Firefly in its creative software, but investors are still waiting for that AI magic to show up in the company’s numbers. On Thursday, the software giant reported revenue for the upcoming quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations. The company expects revenue between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion, slightly below the $5.6 billion analysts had predicted. In after-hours trading, the stock dropped 8%, leaving investors unimpressed.

**Strong Results, But Not Strong Enough**  
Adobe’s third-quarter numbers weren’t bad by any stretch—sales jumped 11% to $5.41 billion, and profit topped estimates at $4.65 per share. The company’s core digital media business, which includes its AI-infused Creative Cloud, also grew 11%. However, guidance for the fourth quarter disappointed, leaving many to wonder when the much-hyped AI features will start meaningfully boosting revenue.

**AI Hype vs. Reality**  
Adobe has been aggressively adding AI capabilities to its software lineup, hoping to cash in on the generative AI trend. But investors were banking on seeing bigger results by now, and the slower-than-expected adoption of AI tools like Firefly has some worried. Competitors like Canva have already hiked prices for AI features, putting pressure on Adobe to follow suit—although such changes could take quarters, if not years, to fully materialize.

**Price Hikes and Patience**  
Adobe is looking for ways to monetize its AI features, but price increases for its software take time to roll out to all customers. Meanwhile, its key metric of net new digital media subscriptions came in at $550 million, slightly below estimates, adding to investor jitters. Despite all the hype surrounding AI, Adobe’s leadership insists the company is just scratching the surface of what these innovations can do.

**The Takeaway**  
For now, it seems Adobe’s AI-driven future is more about potential than actual results. With shares down 8% after the guidance miss, investors are growing impatient for the promised AI uplift. As the company continues to invest in generative AI, the question remains: when will it start paying off in a big way?

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, we’ll get the latest pulse on consumer sentiment with the University of Michigan’s September Survey of Consumers. While it won’t sway the Fed’s decision on interest rates, it still gives us a decent read on how people are feeling about the economy—which, let’s be honest, is always worth knowing.

On the earnings front, it’s pretty quiet. With no big reports on deck, it looks like companies are enjoying a bit of a breather—perhaps gearing up for something bigger down the line. ",2024-09-13,4,3

1e9i6ih_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna [MRNA]: A bullish near term 2024/25 case,"I realize this is a stock that many love to hate, however I thought I’d try writing a bullish case for long term investors!

......................

After several months researching Moderna, I began buying in Feb24. Since then the stock rocketed up from c.$95 to c.$170, I reckon mostly related to H5N1 (""bird flu"") concerns, and then slide back to c.$120.

The recent share movement was clearly overdone, however I believe there are a number of near term factors that could positively impact the share price. **With the CEO (Stéphane Bancel) calling 2024 Moderna’s ""year of execution.""** 

The following is an overview of Moderna's 2024 drug prospects / expected news & each drugs forecasted total addressable market (TAM).

\[Fair warning this is a long post, It’s not meant for the TLDR brigade!\]

&#x200B;

**BY THE END OF THIS YEAR:**

· **01Aug24 Moderna's Q2 2024 results are released**…. I'm a fan of Moderna's CFO & his announcing in Nov23 of a colossal write-off (""right sizing manufacturing"") & reducing guidance etc (a bit of financial ""kitchen sinking!""), which I believe now leaves Moderna room for upside surprises (granted, more likely later in the year). 

· Moderna's **pandemic flu / ""Bird flu""** (mRNA1018; TAM: If required, potentially $Bns) **phase 1/2 trial ends in Jul24**. If these results are promising, the US Gov. have agreed to pay Moderna $176m for phase 3 & will likely buy an unspecified number of doses. 

· Moderna's **Zika** (mRNA1893; TAM likely $bns) **phase 2 trial ends in Jul24**. Moderna has previously said ""we don’t anticipate advancing into further studies in the absence of further outside funding."" However, you have to wonder given the continuing spread of this disease & its economic impact if they were perhaps just giving potential funders time to prepare a package in the event that these results are strong?

· Moderna's **VZV** (**Herpes/Shingles**; mRNA1468; TAM c.$5-6bn) **phase 1/2 trial ends in Jul24**, with a 27Mar24 press release saying ""**We listed comparable or higher CD4 & CD8 T cell responses as compared to Shingrix**."" **Additional (durability) results are expected in the next few months**, with the product advancing towards a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

· Moderna's **CMV** (mRNA1647; TAM c.$2-5bn) trial is **expected to provide interim analysis, possibly even the final analysis for efficacy in 2024**.

· Moderna/Vertex's **Cystic Fibrosis** (mRNA3692 / Vertex Vx522; TAM ?), **phase 1/2 results are expected to be released by YE24**. I reckon the financial impact on Moderna, if the drug is approved in a few years’ time, will be fairly modest. However, **IF** they could take their ""**aerosol delivery**"" LNP knowledge **into other respiratory diseases** it could mean **no more arm jabs** & instead **smaller doses direct the lungs**... Now that's seriously valuable!

&#x200B;

**ACTIONS SET IN MOTION IN 2024, WHICH WILL IMPACT 2024 & 2025:**

· 27Mar24 Positive clinical trial data, led to **3 drugs** (EBV, VZV, Norovirus) being **moved to phase 3**

· 29Apr24 It's **seasonal Flu** (mRNA1010; TAM c.$7bn) elicited some strong immune responses, with Moderna **intending to file** (for FDA approval) **in 2024** 

· 02May24 Presentation explained that **its cancer drug INT** (mRNA4157; TAM of possibly $2-3bn per cancer type) had 3 phase 3 trials (Adjuvant melanoma, NSCLC & cSCC) & 2 phase 2 trials (RCC & bladder cancer) ongoing & that it **hoped to file for ""accelerated approval.""** **IF approved** it could mean INT **sales in 2025** in the US & possibly also in other countries

· 31May24 FDA approved Moderna's **RSV** (mRNA1345; TAM c.$10bn) vaccine. It **will be on sale in the US in 2024** & is waiting for regulatory review in multiple **other countries**, with some **likely to approve in 2024 & others 2025**;

· 07Jun24 Moderna asked the FDA to review its **Covid NextGen** (mRNA1283; TAM c.$10bn) 2024/25 formula (Note: It outperformed Spikevax with a 1/5th of its dose). Assuming it's approved, it **will be ready for sale in 2025**

………………..

&#x200B;

I think it’s fair to say I’m pretty bullish on Moderna! However, I find the Bird flu mania distracting & frankly hope that none of these vaccines are required. 

When I invested my long term pension assets, **I bought into Moderna primarily on the strength of its’ platform & its’ ability to churn out a large variety of drugs across different modalities** (i.e. Respiratory, cancer, latent diseases etc). **This is something special, relatively unique & sets it apart from many other Pharma groups**.

Moderna’s plan to have **4 products on sale in 2025** (NextGen covid, Seasonal Flu, Flu/Covid & RSV), with a total of **15 products over the next 5 years** is what excites me & I believe will drive my investment towards outsized profits!

But, don’t take my word on it, Bancel on 31May 24 (""Bernstein's 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference"" at8.45) said ""**I believe we are going to become the biggest vaccine company in the world, in that time frame \[15 drugs in 5yrs\] just because of the number of products we have, if you look at the number of products we have in the late stage development vaccine it is more than the rest of industry combined!**"" \[Note: Bancel isn’t shy about promoting Moderna!!!\].",2024-07-22,18,28

1dagwmo_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna  (MRNA) - mRNA platform  -  Promising Future Beyond Covid-19 Vaccine,"Moderna's stock price took a hit as the Covid-19 pandemic receded, but the biotech company's future looks bright. Despite the decline in its share price, Moderna is approaching multiple launches beyond its successful Covid-19 vaccine, and its pipeline of mRNA-based vaccines and treatments is advancing rapidly across multiple therapeutic areas. Morningstar believes Moderna's stock is currently undervalued by 36%, and its fair value is $227 per share.

mRNA Technology Validation and Uncertainties

Moderna's mRNA technology gained rapid validation through the soaring sales of its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 and 2022. However, the company has yet to secure a narrow economic moat around its business due to uncertainties tied to the evolving virus and the changing competitive landscape for innovative vaccines.

In an unprecedented span of just 11 months, Moderna created, developed, manufactured, and received regulatory authorization for mRNA-1273, a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine that was one of the first two mRNA vaccines ever authorized, alongside Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2. The pandemic accelerated Moderna's evolution into a commercial-stage biotech, and the company's ramp-up in manufacturing and clinical know-how is expected to pave the way for faster timelines for additional programs.

 Diversified Pipeline and Partnerships

Moderna's mRNA platform, involving rapid design and similar manufacturing across programs, allows the company to pursue multiple programs in parallel. Moderna retains full rights to most of its programs, although partnerships with Merck and Vertex help support its efforts in oncology and cystic fibrosis.

The company reported roughly $18 billion in Covid-19 vaccine sales in both 2021 and 2022. While vaccine fatigue and uncertainty around the severity of Covid-19 infections in the coming season may impact sales, Morningstar assumes $6.2 billion in sales in 2023. Morningstar sees potential for continued revenue around $4 billion annually if higher-risk populations receive annual vaccines, although there is high uncertainty around the number of long-term competitors (including new mRNA players) and pricing, particularly as the US market moves from government contracts to a commercial market.

 Promising Pipeline and Future Prospects

Moderna's phase 3 pipeline beyond Covid-19 is growing and includes potential 2024 launches in RSV and oncology, as well as 2025 launches for a Covid-19/flu combination vaccine and rare disease treatments. Moderna and Merck's melanoma therapy has potential in a wide range of cancers in combination with Merck's Keytruda. Morningstar thinks mRNA technology will eventually be used in a broad spectrum of other therapeutic areas, from cancer to cardiology to rare diseases.",2024-06-07,4,7

1d2nyn9_MRNA,MRNA,Reminder: $MRNA is still overvalued,"As already outlined in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d16d3c/moderna_mrna_is_overvalued_and_the_current/), MRNA has no value proposition at the current levels. I believe it is still about $30 billion over valued.

The reasons why people bought MRNA and why they are invalid:

* H5N1 - people bought it as a ""covid play"" - MRNA went up and created the second global multi-billion injection dose during a pandemic. Now people are saying it will be similar for H5N1, of course that is wrong:
   * [There are already approved vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine), CSL in australia has one, Sanofi has one, GSK, and there is a newer gen one as well.
* AI - for some reason people have been quoting MRNA is an AI play, probably because[ this headline](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-and-OpenAI-Collaborate-To-Advance-mRNA-Medicine/default.aspx).
   * This is so incredibly stupid. This is basically a press release saying MRNA has a commercial license to use chatGPT. Did anyone actually read the article? Who fcking cares! Further, its not material to the science, mRNA technology doesn't need ai, its literally just sequences of RNA... there isn't anywhere to fit ai that would improve success here. Just a stupid thesis all around.
* COVID
   * Just, really? Use your brain. Nobody cares about covid and sales have gone into the gutter. Covid lethality has become less than the flu, there is no more government stockpiling needed.
* Cancer vaccine
   * They aren't getting accelerated approval, they need to run a huge and lengthy Phase 3 trial. It will be 3 years before we learn that it probably failed. In the meantime, they will burn the remaining cash they have and likely have to dilute.
* ??? Meme stock?
   * I have no idea any other reason you would buy MRNA above $20 billion dollars. They are going to run out of cash in 2 years at the current burn rate, and have a huge litigation that they are the trajectory of losing with ABUS.

Good luck to all! Except MRNA bulls, you need a higher IQ.",2024-05-28,13,17
1d16d3c_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna $MRNA is overvalued and the current valuation presents a generational short opportunity. Sell and sell short,"
HELLO I HAVE A $136K margin call due to a credit call spread on MRNA I opened last week. I'm not worried about it. 

Here is why:



The stock has rallied from about $100 to $170 on a couple non-sensical things.

1) Moderna ""lost"" a markman hearing against ABUS. Markman hearings are not super important, it's basically the judge defining what's actually going on in a patent litigation, the definitions, the claims, etc, so that the actual hearing doesn't get too tangential. But the way the claims were defined make it almost certain ABUS will win in court. If they win, MRNA will owe ABUS somewhere in the range of $1 to $7 BILLION.  just depends what % Royalty the hearing ultimately decides what's fair. BUT THE STOCK SHRUGGED THIS OFF. Likely a crowded short that didn't go down because it's a markman... not down? Then up! Shorts covered.

2) RSV vaccine approval not assured. The efficacy of mrna rsv vaccine is not the best, GSK and pfizer have RSV vaccines, and depending on what time point you look at, mrna is either the middle or the worst. https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Announces-Update-on-Investigational-RSV-Vaccine/default.aspx

The fda delayed their PDUFA approval to the end of the month. I assume it'll get approved, but that approval is already priced in, it was priced in at $80... (were at $160).

3) h5n1 bird flu. This is an obvious covid play book. Mrna went crazy during covid. Bird flu is scary. But mrna, right? Wrong.

HUGE different here, most importantly, WE HAVE BIRD FLU VACCINES APPROVED FOR H5N1. There's 3. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine

[Here is the NBC article discussing the same](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna149961)

So people are buying MRNA as a covid-like play, but there is no reason any government will give mrna a stock piling money now - they'll give it to the APPROVED VACCINES (HINT: THEY ARENT MRNA)

4) ASCO conference for their ""cancer vaccine"". This is a whole rabbit hole that would take a long time to explain, but in early June Moderna and merck will present updated data to their mrna vaccine in melanoma. It's a relatively small follow up where we already know the outcome. It ""worked"" but it's unlikely to work in a very large trial.
People think that the results are so good that Merck (and moderna) will file for accelerated approval to the FDA. That's not going to happen. It's too small a trial in too early of a disease setting. As such they will have to run a very large Phase 3 trial. Moderna has been telling investors they can file on accelerated approval, but if you ask Merck, they say no lol, that would be preposterous. 
The ASCO event is a non-event, but people apparently think it's a big deal. But we already know it ""worked"" in this early trial. This update isn't going to change anyone's opinion and isn't meaningful for approval.

As you can see, every reason MRNA is up is actually at best priced in when it was $80. But some of these catalysts are actually quite negative (ABUS markman hearing).

*MRNA burns $1b a quarter.*


Even if approved, the RSV vaccine will be mediocre at best, likely quite sluggish and not meaningful to topline.
ASCO cancer vaccine update is a non event and if no accelerated approval, that's very negative for the stock here.
ABUS will win in 2025 and mrna will owe them probably 4-5 billion dollars (they won't have that much cash then!) 

The long term puts (2025 and 2026) are quite cheap, given this stocks fair value in my opinion is probably $60.

1bmj2xe_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna (MRNA): Why mRNA represents superior tech over Old Pharma's methods,"  
**Before reading this, to be clear, I have ZERO medical training. I'm just an investor that's listened to an absurd number of Moderna podcasts.** While I've invested in Moderna for its mRNA platform (which I believe sets it apart from its competitors), there are of course other Pharma companies that also utilize mRNA technology, of which Pfizer-BioNTech is a very notable example.  
  
There's no way the following list is complete, so please let me know what I've missed in the comments & of course any mistakes!... I'm up for learning.  
  
**So, why do I think Moderna's mRNA is superior to Old Pharma's methods:**

  
1) Using mRNA **you can make medicines which are technically undoable** using small molecule old chemistry technology. A 09Apr22 Pod at3.00 said ***only c.30% of the proteins in the body were accessible with old pharma / biotech drugs***.. i.e. mRNA gives access the 30% & all the rest.  


2) Using mRNA **you get rapid & iterative development** (""tweaks"" to improve the code), bringing down drug cycle time from Pharma's 6-8yrs down to Moderna's c.2yrs. ***Moderna credits its ability to rapidly tweak its mRNA code with why it only took an average of 1-2 years to move their CV19, RSV & flu programs from Phase 1 to the end of Phase 3***.  


3) **With mRNA our bodies cells create the vaccine**, it's not grown outside the body. Think of it as, ***mRNA turning human cells into medicine factories, producing their own disease-fighting proteins, essentially outsourcing part of the vaccine production to our own cells***! As an example: In the case of Flu, vaccines are slowly cultured on the fluid from chicken embryos which takes time. Because that method takes time, currently the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended **quad**rivalent (i.e. **4 types**) strains are selected a considerable time in advance, ***with mRNA on the scene they could select problem flu strains later, with better knowledge, resulting (hopefully) in a better match to the prevalent strain***.

  
4) With mRNA there's **a lower chance of toxicity issues**. On a 24Jun20 pod\] at20.14 (Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel) said ""the raw material of Moderna is genetic information, this is not something we guess. If you think about it, ***most chemicals tested by pharma have toxicity issues*** because they don’t exist in nature, ***they're not supposed to be in the human body***, but ***the protein we get made by mRNA have existed in the human body forever, so the probability of success will be higher***""   


5) mRNA from the outset **has a better/quicker chance of finding a drug solution**.. a Stéphane Bancel pod (2021 ep89 at29.40) put is this way.. Another thing that's fascinating about this ***mRNA technology***, which I've never seen in pharma before, is that y***ou design your product to spec***. You ***start backwards from what problem you’re trying to solve*** (e.g. the solution for a disease), just as an architect would draw up plans before building a house, *unlike old pharma which works forward from the best molecule you can give me from a lab*.. ***For CMV we didn't start by saying we need 6 mRNA, no we said what’s the right biology to make a vaccine that will get approved because it's going to work safely***.  


6) Using mRNA, unlike Old Pharma, **you don't need a sample of the virus** & all the attendant handling risks with say infectious disease. They ***just need a genome sequence***.  


7) Using mRNA can lead to **capital/manufacturing efficiencies**, leading to **cheaper drugs or (of course) larger margins**. In Moderna’s case, ***each of their new manufacturing sites will support their entire drug platform***, with the ability to go from mRNA vaccines (you don’t yet have the disease) to mRNA therapeutics (you have the disease).   


8) mRNA **can lead to quicker drug discovery**. An obvious example of this is Moderna & Pfizer/BioNTech Covid response compared to Old Pharma’s efforts.   
  
Old Pharma is of course investing in mRNA, partnering with mRNA companies & even acquiring a few businesses (hopefully Moderna it too large, not interested!). To be honest I reckon this is great for society, however **I believe Moderna's Platform which is solely focused on mRNA** (no legacy old Pharma stuff!), **10+yrs of “Data Assets”** \[I've covered this in previous posts\] **& its manufacturing process will keep it ahead of the pack** although there's plenty to go around.  
  
Good luck in whatever you decide to invest in!

1bkiv8o_MRNA,MRNA,"Moderna (MRNA): To paraphrase.. It's not about Covid, stupid!","The stock boomed on its Covid product, then collapsed as the disease moved from pandemic (it's out of control) to endemic (manageable, but always present). However, on the back of this one product the company made tens of $bn's, using this windfall to target other respiratory diseases (primarily flu & RSV) & ploughed $4-5bn R&D a year into pivoting & broadening its product pipeline.

**When thinking of Moderna, forget about Covid**, it's good for paying current bills & provides a handy annuity-like stream of future (diminished) earnings, but **it arguably plays just a bit part on why anyone would buy (like I have) Moderna**.

Moderna's Covid vaccine sits within its Respiratory / Infectious disease ""modality"", with another 6 modalities (e.g. cancer, latent diseases, rare disease, Inhaled pulmonary etc) rounding out their portfolio. The portfolio has 45 development programs, across 4 therapeutic areas, of which 9 are late stage. I didn’t think much of these numbers until I heard (16Jun21 Pod at46.10) that it was ""a high number compared to a 5-10yr old biotech company that will generally have 2-3 clinical candidates!""... What the heck, the power of a mRNA platform over Old Pharm / Biotech!

So, **there's a remarkably fat pipeline** of which their Covid vaccine may in the future play a relatively small part. Nonetheless, they're currently still just a 1-drug-company-with-a-lovely-fantasy-story until some of these other products get approved..... ***The following is a brief overview of part of their late stage pipeline***.

&#x200B;

**1) Next-Gen COVID (mRNA1283)** \#Added 3 days later, having originally missed it off the list#

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Previously the World, now a greatly reduced forecasted sales of c.$4bn.

**KEY DATES**: ***Expected in 1H24***

**COMPETITORS**: Primarily Pfizer/BioNTech

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: mRNA1283 is an update of mRNA1273 (Spikevax), designed to be refrigerator-stable. Phase 1/2 clinical study elicited a potent neutralizing antibody response comparable to 50 µg mRNA1273, using a lower dose levels, all in all it demonstrated encouraging results in multiple clinical studies. Phase 3 had 11.5k in the trial, enrolled between Apr-Aug23.

&#x200B;

**2) RSV: Respiratory Syncytial Virus**

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Potential to be >$10bn market ($2-4bn maternal & pediatrics and $6-8bn older adults), globally 1.5m cases & c336k hospitalizations.

**KEY DATES**: *US approval decision on* ***12May24***. CDC recommendations at a vaccine meeting in late ***Jun24.***

**COMPETITORS**: Two.. GSK (Arexvy) & Pfizer (Abrysvo)

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: *Received* ***“breakthrough” designation from FDA***. Moderna’s data showed an efficacy of 84% at 3.3Mths & c.63% after 8.6Mths. Compared to GSK's fall from 83% to 77% at 14Mths & Pfizer's fall from 89% to 79% at 14mths... So it’s NOT good?... HOWEVER, it's not a like for like comparison, being a different calendar period & for 3 symptoms V. their 2, with Pfizer’s 14Mth efficacy against 2 symptoms falling from 67% to 49%. Overall, they all passed their efficacy levels, with Moderna's pre filled syringe v. 4-9 steps for the others a positive differentiator.

&#x200B;

**3) Flu & Combos (Flu/Covid)**:

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: The current flu market is c.$6bn, however could grow to c.$9bn in 2028. Worldwide 3-5M severe cases of influenza & 290-650K deaths annually.

**KEY DATES**: ***Intend to file for the flu in 2024***... The combination ***flu/Covid phase 3 data expected in 2024***.

**COMPETITORS**: Primarily it’s Sanofi’s Fluzone, a currently licensed vaccine.

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: Flu met it's primary endpoint in a Phase 3 trial, outperforming Sanofi’s Fluzone at tackling 3 strains & as able on the 4th strain. ***Intends to file in 2024***... *The combo* ***has “Fast Track” designation from FDA*** & has recently initiated a Phase 3 trial with the *intention to have a combination vaccine available as* ***early as 2025.*** ......... With regards to Flu, Old Pharma requires a long lead time to prepare, while mRNA is much quicker which could allow a later in the season product to be created providing a better match with the actual (not WHO forecasted 4 variants) outbreak. Old Pharma gets c.60% efficacy in a good year & c.20-25%, leaving the door wide open for mRNA products.

&#x200B;

**4) CMV**: Cytomegalovirus; Birth defects/miscarriage, 2-3x Downs Syndrome, transplant complications.

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: Globally there are c. 40m births a year, with an estimated market of $2-5bn/pa.

**KEY DATES**: Given the rate of case accrual that they're seeing in the study, they're pretty confident that they're going to be seeing a readout from the interim analysis, ***possibly*** even the final analysis for ***efficacy in 2024***.

**COMPETITORS**: Zero. There is currently no vaccine.

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: *CMV has been designated a* ***“top priority”*** *in new vaccine development by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine* ***for more than two decades!*** This is a highly complex virus, with Moderna's vaccine having 6 mRNA molecules per vial (for perspective, Covid had just 1). Their phase 2 results are frankly difficult to understand, however the Moderna CEO said ***""the phase 2 CMV data is phenomenal.***""

&#x200B;

**5) INT**: Individualized Neoantigen Therapy; In particular, for adjuvant melanoma (skin cancer) & adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) & more recently (11Mar24) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC; a form of skin cancer)

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: In 2020 global cancer, all types, rose to >19m new cases & 10m deaths. They're currently targeting a small subset of this, but are expected to expand... Note Merck's Keytruda costs $150k/yr per patient, selling c.$2bn/yr, with INT expected to be approx. the same.

**KEY DATES**: They are ***looking for accelerated approval in 2024***, if not then likely 2025.

COMPETITORS: There is no one doing what they are doing. An individualized cancer treatment, based on your own personal cancer!

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: A Moderna & Merck joint product. It's ***received “Breakthrough Therapy” Designation from FDA*** *in Feb23 &* ***“PRIME Designation” from EMA*** *in Apr23*.. 3yr analysis of its Phase 2b study saw it reduce the risk of recurrence or death by 49% & the risk of developing distant metastasis or death by 62% \[The 2yr data was 44% & 65%\]. They are currently enrolling for phase 3.

&#x200B;

**6) Rare genetic diseases**: There are estimated to be *c. 10,000 rare diseases with a patient population of 1,000s-10,000s*. A pod I listened to suggested they *could sell for $100,000s per patient*, giving perhaps $100’s million per drug which is overall quite small but the ""overall opportunity"" could be quite large across various drugs. In addition, *consider the colossal expense of RSV's 37k patient phase 3 trial against, the* ***rare disease 12-50 patients per study & you can get a sense of how much cheaper such Developments are*** (although the ""Research"" bit of the R&D I imagine is perhaps the same)

&#x200B;

**6A) PA**: Propionic; A rare inherited metabolic disorder.

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: 100-150k individuals worldwide.

**KEY DATES**: They expect to advance it ***into a pivotal study in 2024***.

**COMPETITORS**: Zero.

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**:  It *received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation,* ***Orphan Drug Designation*** *&* ***Fast Track Designation from the FDA***. Their phase 1/2 trial with 16 patients saw a reduction in Metabolic Decompensations Events (MDE; Considered a clinically meaningful endpoint for development) of 71% overall & of an 80% reduction via their 2wk regime dosage! I gather their next trial will focus on this 2wk regime dosage, with another Redditor (I think a doctor) saying ""I thought they would have filed for approval for the PA medication"", which I took to mean the data was as impressive as it looks.

&#x200B;

**6B) MMA**: Methylmalonic acidemia; A inherited metabolic disorder, mainly affects babies.

**POTENTIAL PATIENT POOL**: 1/48K births, 21k patients

**KEY DATES**: They expect to advance it ***into a pivotal study in 2024***.

**COMPETITORS**: There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for MMA.

**A BRIEF OVERVIEW**: Ongoing Phase 1/2 Study with 15 participants. Interim results demonstrated encouraging initial data in cohorts 2 & 3. They are currently dosing their 5th cohort & are selecting optimal dosing.

&#x200B;

***I didn’t set out to write the most tedious article on Reddit, but I reckon I smashed it!*** Anyway, the not too subtle point which I hope I got across is investors should shift their gaze away from Covid (yesterday’s news) to Moderna’s pipeline. It would be great if all of the above succeed, however I don’t think its actually required. Once just a few of the drugs are approved institutional money will once again begin to sniff around.",2024-03-21,50,49

18llx12_MRNA,MRNA,Buy the Rumor on MRNA,"MRNA without a doubt is the proverbial ""Covid Stock.""  Many prognosticators and pundits have gone bottom fishing and failed numerous times to catch the falling knife.  However, I'm going to go where many a portfolio has gone to die before, (except there's actually evidence the sellers are losing momentum).

Let's start with the technicals:  As we saw in my successful prediction on SQ, [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block\_inc\_sq\_high\_probability\_technical\_bullish/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block_inc_sq_high_probability_technical_bullish/), the technicals line up with bullish news and subsequent price reversal which substantially over performed a bull rally in the markets for November and December.  I will use the same technical indicators that predicted the SQ rally to make the case for MRNA on a monthly chart. I will also look at traditional regular candles and Heikin Ashi candles (which can better help us understand trends and avoid the noise).

In this case, the month of November, we saw a bullish MOM divergence which can be defined as a situation where the momentum indicator (MOM) shows a higher low while the price of an asset shows a lower low. This indicates that the downward trend is losing strength and that the price may reverse to the upside soon.  Looking at the monthly chart on MRNA sellers began losing significant momentum in November when viewing traditional candles.  This was confirmed by the Heikin Ashi candles in November which once again measure the overall strength of a trend.   Furthermore, we saw a substantial increase in the Chaikin Money Flow which in layman's terms measures inflows and outflows of capital in an equity.  In conjunction with bullish divergence, the corresponding technicals make a strong case that the bottom on MRNA is in.

Of course, some of you don't believe in technicals (even though they're simply a visual medium of supply and demand...), so we'll discuss how we are in the buy the rumor stage of Moderna. Recently Merck and Moderna announced progress and strong efficacy in Stage 2 trials for their skin cancer MRNA vaccine treatment.  Merck offered somewhat conservative guidelines, but Modenra expects the vaccine to be ready for approval in 2025.  As we saw in some of the recent patent approval for drugs, achieving the patent is not always bullish for a stock (I'm looking at you Bluebird). However, in this case the perception that a 49% reduction in Melanoma is not too far down the pipeline, this correlates with the price action we are seeing in the technicals.

Keep in mind, MRNA stock is mainly owned by large institutions, only a small amount of it is actually owned by retail...you can draw what conclusions on that from you want, but in my mind (and from reading some of the stupid things people say here) that is unquestionably bullish.  Declining COVID vaccination rates have hit other COVID beneficiaries like Pfizer hard, however also take into account Moderna's vaccine showed the greatest efficacy out of all of them, which is an empirically a good sign that the technology is viable and superior to competitors.

With all of that being said, I have and am building a position in MRNA.  The reasons are listed above and your chance to get a 2nd shot at a bio-tech that could potentially quadruple its multiple by 2025.  Don't listen to me, listen to where the money is going....

\*Chaikin Money Flow will be the green arrow at the bottom of the images. Traditional RSI is also shown.  I have provided weekly charts to show a different look and to indicate performance of the indicators mentioned.

Regen BioPharma, [(OTC-PINK: RGBP)](https://regenbiopharmainc.com/) and (OTC-PINK: RGBPP) is a biotechnology company working in the immunology and immunotherapy space. RGBP is focused on rapidly advancing novel technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials. Currently, RGBP is developing mRNA and small molecule therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders.

RGBP plans to rapidly advance novel technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials. Currently, RGBP is advancing therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders by modulating the immune checkpoint NR2F6. RGBP is also developing products treating blood disorders using small molecules and gene silencing (DiffronC), treating cancer with cellular immunotherapy (dCellVax, tCellVax, Dura-CAR, KimerApt), modulating key molecular processes in cancer stem cell through its patented molecular targeting approaches (BORIS), and repairing damaged bone marrow in patients with aplastic anemia and chemotherapy/radiotherapy treated cancer patients (HemaXellerate).

RGBP Expects Second Phase of Confirmatory Study Shortly

On October 18th RGBP reported on its current development of a genetic approach to regulating NR2F6 levels in human T cells. RGBP has recently received unexpected and potentially extremely useful data from one of its contract research organizations (CRO) retained to perform experimental studies on the Company’s DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic. These studies demonstrated that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct expressing siRNA for NR2F6 can be successfully created.

“A second unrelated CRO is currently performing qRT-PCR tests to determine if NR2F6 mRNA is elevated or inhibited by our CAR in T-Cells,” says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to RGBP.” If NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed (stimulating certain immune functions) then this product shows potential for treatment of cancer and if NR2F6 mRNA is elevated (suppressing certain immune functions) then the product shows potential for treatment of autoimmune disorders.”

Once RGBP receives the data, it will analyze the results and report the findings in a press release in order to keep the company’s shareholders informed of its progress.

RGBP Receives First Phase of Confirmatory Study

CAR-T Cells Created

On October 10th RGBP issued an announcement covering its previously discussed initiation of a series of experiments to validate its DuraCAR CAR T-cell therapeutic ( [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regen-biopharma-inc--begins-experiments-validating-its-proprietary-car-t-cell-therapy-301623585.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regen-biopharma-inc--begins-experiments-validating-its-proprietary-car-t-cell-therapy-301623585.html) ) while also identifying new, unexpected and potentially extremely useful findings in developing cell therapy treatments for autoimmune disorders [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/studies-on-regen-biopharma-incs-duracar-indicate-potential-suppression-of-autoimmunity-company-retains-contract-research-organization-to-conduct-additional-confirmatory-studies-301931365.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/studies-on-regen-biopharma-incs-duracar-indicate-potential-suppression-of-autoimmunity-company-retains-contract-research-organization-to-conduct-additional-confirmatory-studies-301931365.html).

RGBP then reported it had received the first set of confirmatory data which demonstrates that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 were successfully created. In addition, the siRNA that is designed into the CAR T-cell was very highly expressed. Subsequent RGBP studies will determine if the expression of NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed or enhanced as a result of the high expression of siRNA.

“This is a major accomplishment in moving this model forward into therapies because in order to test whether we can genetically manipulate NR2F6 levels, we have to be able to produce a CAR T-cell where we demonstrate expression of this siRNA,” says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to RGBP. “We are excited to see the results on NR2F6 expression. If it is inhibited, we will focus on using these DuraCAR cells as originally envisioned - to attack solid tumors. If it is enhanced, we will begin re-tooling these cells to treat autoimmune disorders.”

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by about $8, or 2% last week, less than the 2.5% ($11) move options were pricing. Implied volatility is about the same as last week.

### In the News

Cryptocurrencies have bounced off recent lows but are still significantly lower than their Nov 2021 highs. One of the more high-profile equities in the space, **Coinbase** reports this week. COIN is down nearly 50% since Nov 21. It is lower than its IPO reference price of $250 and significantly lower than the intra-day high it saw on its first day of trading (above $400).  


Options are pricing a move of about 11% for earnings, (or about $21). With the stock $187, a $21 move lower would take out recent lows. In other words, the bearish expected move would mean a new low. And on the upside, a $21 move higher would not reach the $220 resistance level. In other words, the bullish expected move is not pricing a move back to obvious resistance. You can see the difference in probability assigned by the options market at those support and resistance levels.  


https://i.redd.it/9pm1fzd3z8j81.gif

This can help inform strike selection beyond or inside of the expected move. For instance, those that are bullish could target the resistance level for the potential for extra reward beyond the expected move. And for those that are bearish, the options market is *not* putting a lot of weight on the stock being able to hold that support level if the stock goes lower on earnings. Therefore a move lower would be into uncharted territory, a situation that has seen outsized moves lately in other names.

And finally, BTC options are pricing about a 6% move this week, less than the 11% COIN options are pricing, for those that see COIN trade more as a proxy than anything else.

sfjfds_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna’s HIV Vaccine Has Officially Begun Human Trials,"Few people have been hit harder during the COVID-19 pandemic than those who are immunocompromised — including people whose immune systems have been ravaged by HIV/AIDS. But that dark chapter of medical history may soon be drawing to a close. That’s the hope in Washington, D.C., at least, where scientists with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Moderna have announced that human trials for the company’s experimental HIV vaccine have officially begun.

“We are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform,” said IAVI president and CEO Mark Feinberg in the announcement. “The search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.” Human candidates, recruited for clinical trials last August, received the study’s first shots on Thursday at George Washington University’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The vaccine builds on technology developed by Moderna during their COVID-19 vaccine production, with the goal of using mRNA to boost HIV immunogens and prevent the virus from disabling B cells, which are essential to fighting disease.

Although medicines like PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have proved somewhat effective in slowing the spread of HIV and reducing its mortality, the virus is still a threat to global health nearly forty years after it was first identified. Scientists hope to conclude human trials next year in 2023, coinciding with HIV’s grim 40th anniversary. “We believe advancing this HIV vaccine program in partnership with IAVI and Scripps Research is an important step in our mission to deliver on the potential for mRNA to improve human health,” said Moderna president Stephen Hoge. Only time will tell whether this vaccine will succeed where others have failed — but we’ll be praying, crossing our digits, and wishing on every star that by next year, LGBTQ+ communities around the globe will have a new reason to celebrate.

rqtos2_MRNA,MRNA,MRNA is a $30 stock,"I don't do DD.  I look at things from a 10000 foot view.  From my elevation Moderna looks way overvalued.  In December of 2018 Moderna's IPO was the largest biotech IPO in history valuing the company at an incredible $7.5B.  At the time they were touting their research into mRNA as ""the software of life"".  The news story that I read said that there was "" no mRNA-based drug has ever been approved by the FDA nor any other regulatory agency, so it will be years before Moderna will be able to bring anything to market"".  Well that changed pretty quickly and the market went crazy.  Taking the crazy valution from $7.5B to $200B before backing off to the current $100B.  Does the fact that they came up with a fairly effective vaccine (and we don't want to get into the whole debate here about how effective it was) mean that they should now be valued at 12 x what they were worth when they IPO'd?  I say no.  The next drug that they come up with is going to have to go through regular clinical trials and won't have the advantage  of being needed by every human being on the planet.  So what is it worth?  I gave my prediction away in the headline.  For  the first 18 or so months of its existence it was a $20 stock.  Their tech is now a bit more proven so in my mind I'll give them a 50% bump.  That makes it a $30 stock.  I also think that it's going to go down faster than most people think.  Here in Canada, where we have a much higher vaccine acceptance rate, there is resistance to the booster.  Tens of thousands of available appointments are going unfilled in the midst of the Omicron wave.  Covid is largely being ignored.  The government is advising against travel yet everyone I know is travelling for the holidays.  No one that I know cancelled a trip because of Omicron.  If the plane was leaving, they were going to be on it.  When you hear that someone has Covid now you kind of feel badly for them because they have to isolate for a few days.  You're not worried that they are going to die.  Is this a population that is going to rush out and get the booster.  no way.  There's talk of changing the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include a booster but I can't see the political will to do that when the population is effectively ""voting"" by abstaining.  Politician's first job is to get elected and second job is to get re-elected.  They know that.  When there is a 70% uptake in vaccines they can  come up with mandates.  When there is a 40% (I made that number up) uptake in boosters, they won't be quite so quick to mandate them.

I picked Moderna and bought long $70 puts.  I think that Novavax would be just as good a target.

qp11pq_MRNA,MRNA,Help understanding the various outcomes of buying calls on MRNA - suffering from a seeming block on understanding,"Greetings to all,

I have an above average understanding of business fundamentals and standard investing, but for some reason I’m having an extremely hard time wrapping my head around options. I did read the sub info an watch some videos. I also purchased one recently just to see what would happen. A SNAP call at $59. I watched it lose value until it expired at $0. Usually, I watch and learn and emerge with a general understanding of what I’m doing. In this case, I realized I had no idea at all what happened. 

This brings me to today. I invested a year or so ago in Moderna. I believe in the company long term. The market reaction to the COVID pills was too strong in my opinion and the massive drop last week from high of $350 to a low of $211 was far too much of an over correction. 

I think it will return to $300-$310 in the relative near future. The company has orders to easily sustain it through 2022, much increased manufacturing and distribution, and the COVID vaccine was an indicator at just how effective this technology is. I want to buy what I can and hold long, but I also want to try my hand at options to make some gains on the over correction. 

Are there tools or graphs online where I can visualize various scenarios? Or is this basically guesswork? 

I’m considering 11/12 or 11/19 calls. 

Why would anyone buy an option above the current share price? Lower premium, I understand that. It seems I would only do that if I feel really strongly that the stock will move a significant amount very quickly. 

An option under current stock price will cost me more on the premium, but if it does move up to where I think it should be, I make that extra $10 or $20 per share, minus the increase in premium. But the premium increase at every $5 seems to negate the gain?

I can trade from Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, or Robinhood (which is just easiest for me because I like the UI and I already have some MRNA shares there). 

On RH I can see all sorts of things like IV%, estimated chance at profit, each of the Greeks, etc. But what should I be looking for when determining a price to buy and a date to exercise? For example, 

the 11/12 $230 call at $14.95. I’d need the stock to get to $244.35 to break even, an increase in 6.10%. IV is 97.23% and chance of profit is 37.16%. 

The 11/19 $230 call is $17.58. So I risk losing more for the safety of an extra week. IV is 82.13%, chance of profit is down to 35.62%. I don’t understand the relationship between the IV value and chance to profit. 

Or should I shoot further out? Q1 of 2022? Longer?

Finally, do you have to actually sell all 100 shares if you do exercise the option or can you keep some? I don’t understand that part because I’ve never seen a successful option in real life. 

I know that was a lot. I’m eager to learn. I really appreciate your assistance or referral to an easy to understand but solid place to finally crack this comprehension barrier.",2021-11-07,9,12

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

Options are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:

## In the News

The FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.

qfn8vd_MRNA,MRNA,"Curious, was MRNA manipulated on Friday 10/22?","I see this happen all the time, but was wondering what you guys think about this one. On Friday, 10/22:

Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Papadakis initiated coverage of Moderna (ticker: MRNA) with a Sell rating on the shares and a target price of $225.

This is also while:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended booster doses of Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) COVID-19 vaccines for certain groups.     

This triggered a massive selloff and the stock fell from $333 to a low of $317 that day, closing around $326 after multiple days of gains. My question is:

Why does MRNA fall even though there were generally favorable news for the stock that day? 

As in, CDC endorsing took weeks of work while Mr. Papadakis was only a day thing.

Now the stock is sitting at $345 gaining again today building on news starting from the CDC endorsement.

Was this an inside job to cover their Short positions? I am completely baffled by the market response. I would love to understand how this scenario works from a financial (not speculative) perspective. Thanks!",2021-10-25,0,6

p949cz_MRNA,MRNA,Will Moderna maintain it's lead in mRNA technology?,"Moderna has 45x p/e ratio. BioNTech is 15x. What's the difference?

I understand that mRNA technology is going to blow up in the next decade. People are talking about vaccines for zika virus, cancer, other flu-related diseases.

That's great, but is it too early to declare Moderna the clear winner? Do they have some kind of unbreachable lead in mRNA technology compared to other companies? If so then I think their current violation is worth it. I mean, they will literally cure cancer.

Some possible scenarios that will challenge Moderna's current lead in mRNA technology.

* Some researchers from Moderna could leave and form their own company. This kind of competition [happens all the time](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/ex-pfizer_and_az_employees_launch_start-ups_at_biocity_nottingham_350899).

* Moderna could implode due to poor management. There are several [former employees critical of their current CEO](https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/13/moderna-therapeutics-biotech-mrna/), saying that he values valuation over science.

* Geopolitical factors could encourage countries like China to subsidize their own mRNA champion. China would not want to rely on the west for mRNA technology. They will probably subsidize (and protect the market of) their home grown pharmaceutical companies.

&#x200B;

Background:

&#x200B;

After a volatile day typical of a low GEX print, I'd be lying if I didn't go into today's session with a slight upside bias for MRNA. Yesterday I had bought  weekly exp 500c's with the intention to hold overnight following the bounce of $459.xx lvl.

I sold half of that position a little later into the day yesterday for a modest 60% profit, but blinded by my bias towards MRNA I chose to ignore a bunch of signals especially a sub optimal close, choosing instead to foolishly hold on to those contracts overnight. 

BIG MISTAKE, as we discovered today at open. We gapped down below MRNA's $445 support, and opened at $443 with MRNA showing no intention of reclaiming $460. It was a great lesson and timely reminder in keeping my emotional biases in check and not wavering from my strategy. Yeah all these years into trading and the market never forgets to remind me to reign myself in, often harshly, when my head's getting too far up my ass. 

&#x200B;

Trade setup: 

1. With the sub $459.xx and $445 opens, the odds were stacked against MRNA bulls from the start. 

2. It attempted to overcome $445 half heartedly on anemic volume and was promptly rejected

3. With $445 gone I knew a test of the Yellow Channel lower bound would be next

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Entry 1: I BTO 08/13 MRNA 430p @ 7.50 per contract at 9:36 AM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Playout: 

1. Just like clockwork, MRNA wasted no time in sliding to the lower bound of the Yellow Channel

and more importantly chewed through the lvl without any sweat at all.

2. MRNA then proceeded to bear flag with now taking the channel support as resistance

3. On the break of the Bear Flag we visited $420 real quick, which also co-incided with

Trade setup for Trade 2:

1. Buyers were momentarily rejuvenated after this support bounce but the anemic volume

suggests we saw sellers book minimal profits; instead they ostensibly added to their shorts. 

2. Price continued to float up on low volume, for a test of the VWAP it had earlier gotten away

from in how quickly it made this move down

3. Buyers however, had their shot for a follow thru on the bounce and squandered it right here

 by not showing enough conviction, as seen by the less than decent volume on that VWAP test. 

4. Buyers found themselves shown up by sellers who set up a strong bearish engulfing on that resultant VWAP rejection

5. Bulls tried to save face by attempting a half hearted EMA test but that lacking volume wasn't gonna fool anyone

6. This lack of conviction by the bulls in the face of a strong bear showing told us who was in charge 

and all but confirmed the sellers' intent. 

7. The bears who had seemingly had enough of that laughable showing by the bulls, took back control and were raring to let loose 

&#x200B;

Entry 2: I BTO MRNA 08/13 420p @ 9.60 per contract at 10:40 AM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Playout: 

1. As expected, sellers took control and wasted no time in smashing thru the channel $420 and pulled us back into the green channel 

2. With us firmly back in the green channel, there was no major resistance until $400, and we visited that lvl quick

3. I would have ideally exited my position when we hit $400 but with the tailwind we had from tearing through the bounds of not one but two channels, I decided to hang on

4. After a little struggle, and not many buyers showing up to defend $400, we slid below it

5. As I have written before, it is a hallmark of a good, strong trend if price consolidates in a flag or pennant right below/above a contentious resistance/support lvl with that previous resistance/support the new support/resistance depending on whether it is a downward/upward trend. 

6. MRNA did exactly that, forming yet another Bear Flag with the $400 lvl flipped to resistance now, acting as the ceiling of the flag

7. On the break of the flag we rolled down without stopping for a breath, not until we got within touching distance of the green channel's lower bound, only a dollar or two away

8. We had a bounce in the form of a bullish engulfing here and having orchestrated an almost -15% move today, sellers would be naturally vulnerable, leaving the door open for a Dead Cat bounce. And what more opportune moment to have one than at the lower bound of the present price channel

9. I, therefore, knew not to get too greedy and exited my position here.

Here was the original forecast;

One of the things I've found most useful that I've covered in my posts is the tendency for markets to reverse off parabolic moves into a 161 level. 

 

>Now I know most of you don't give a fuck about 161s, but that's probably because you don't know about the fucking weird sketchy shit that happens around 161s.

 [Why I think a SPX high soon is possible. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p08vzd/why_i_think_a_spx_high_soon_is_possible/) 

&#x200B;

Here's the move into the high with fibs drawn off the last pullback in MRNA. 

https://preview.redd.it/foi1gbmxwsg71.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a040b83ecae36f9584a6211db1486485cc6b79b

The highlighted area would have been a very obvious entry in real time if you were using the phases explained.  [ Times to bear: When it makes sense to fade big trends. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1twk3/times_to_bear_when_it_makes_sense_to_fade_big/) 

&#x200B;

We're matching various conditions we'd need for the model. Phase 6 is a parabolic move, the rush of euphoria. Phase 7 is the dump when price rejects from the 161 level. Phase 7 is the bull trap and using this model you'd have been filling pending orders on the 161 retest (Market went a tiny bit higher and then dumped hard).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rosv88z9xsg71.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ad57d8b0aefc1b03b23329e266d2366ba537c29

And using this model this was the forecast generated. 

https://preview.redd.it/90qmrz6fysg71.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=4502472dab4842fe434b98995fdb9de6f8b668cf

Looks a lot alike. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0q0xrnjysg71.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4cfc389cfddc9485ac7b33960f5f77425921f39

I could ""Claim"" that, this isn't actually what I was trying to show in the OP.  I think it's reasonably unlikely the high has been made and the crash has started on this, assuming there's to be a crash. But I actually meant to show a deeper drop (Bear trap) before the high, which I assumed would happen from 440 and not 500. 

I think we're actually in a dummy crash. The start of the trappy section of the trend. Where there's a big drop to trap bears and then a parabolic rally to trap bulls - and then there's a real crash. Typically this is a news loaded part of the move. Prices move fast and volatile and usually there's headlines flying around to explain these.  

If we are in the dummy crash, it should stop by around 38% retracement. And then start to aggressively uptrend. Going parabolic 20% after breaking the high. Then settling into a longer and slower top - a top usually takes a long time to form. We could still be a considerable amount of time away from the top in this.  

We may only be in this section of a top (This is a template of common stages I see in tops I use generically, it's not fitted to this move). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/py300jewzsg71.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ba80e1bd43796ae8aedf7352b59c0a2e81f106

Looking at the small timeframe price action on the break in MRNA it matches quite a lot of the common parts of this topping pattern (I can ""Claim"" this one. These were moves I was talking about when I made this template. Market breaks off highs). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nrpe1f80tg71.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=e423fa1c2cc3fe5401b3c0b8b63637c105ec1fe2

So all of these are flagging up heavy bearish signals, but where things go devastatingly wrong for bears is when they confuse this move with the start of a big crash and it turns out in a big timeframe perspective we're actually here.  

https://preview.redd.it/msjbjp8o0tg71.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8dc7a353f8a06aa1acab6e8b9dc8cecbc76bff6

And that this is going to start to trend back upwards aggressively through the big down day candles and then spike these out by approximately 20 - 25% before making a real top. 

https://preview.redd.it/b3exoogy0tg71.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f23b67d3b0674ed11a89b69881aca24eb710e

When we have sharp pullbacks we can draw 161's off them and if this is to be the last bear trap before the real crash typically we're going to see the crash starting somewhere between the 161 and 220 fibs. Over the 220 fib level price is telling you this is not working. This is not a ""Right eventually"" strategy - small zones are defined in which the probability are more favourable. 

Here would be our forecast with that.  Interestingly the 161 rule matches the ""Above 20%"" rule. And with these two independent factors agreeing we'd also still have to see price going parabolic into that level to give us a confirmed short setup. So as price is heading into the 575 - 600 zone we'd have a very well planned trade.  Very defined shorting plan.  

https://preview.redd.it/4vhhv7nh1tg71.png?width=1429&format=png&auto=webp&s=9047c85e65306f43c99bba429b005316f2ba55d5

**Bear porn** 

&#x200B;

Here's where it gets fucky - and this is the only reason I care about telling people, tbh. 

&#x200B;

Here's the trade we've just seen in MRNA in the SPX. Instability section of 2018 and 2019 into the strong breakout. Hits a 161. Price changes direction.  There was news. I know that's a fact - but this was also exactly on the 161. That's also a fact. There's only one way to draw this swing. Only one high, only one low. Hit the 161 of it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lr4z3a882tg71.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab2b3a0dbc0a6dcadaff66159ab73bdec5a442b

The market would drop about 30% ... This is the ""Known"" typical ratio of the last bear trap. 

When that happened, it would have been possible to do the same thing we've just done with MRNA. If we think a crash can come, we can make a plan that if it gets into a new high, and then it goes parabolic during that new high, with it going parabolic to about 20 - 25% above the high, then we can short it - only if this is also a 161 extension. 

And this gives signals here. 

https://preview.redd.it/pn8rov9y2tg71.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6751623b8d1725728812424ca98f3dd1688e5b5

Using this model is not flagging up a lot of random signals to short things because ""The stock's not worth this much"" - that should work, but it fucking doesn't.  Circled in blue are places where using this you're likely to pick up short signals in real time (Some would lose). And in red is all the places people associate shorting with when they think it always loses. We're not trading those areas.

https://preview.redd.it/w01yjxlp3tg71.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=73e656095c71d93933394a027ad3a672b42a8e5a

With that in mind, a combination of the things covered in '[When to Bear](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1twk3/times_to_bear_when_it_makes_sense_to_fade_big/)' and '[Why I think SPX High](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p08vzd/why_i_think_a_spx_high_soon_is_possible/)'  there is a strong case built up for shorting as it headed into 4,000 and while it is in the 4,000 - 4,750 sort of range. If it breaks over the 220 fib, this would be reason to exit bear trades. It will be right soon, or it won't be. It's not an ""Eventually strategy"". 

If SPX was to be following this model, the next big swing's rules would be; 

* Drops approximately 50% - 60%
* This spikes out low of big bear trap

&#x200B;

Two rules, both have to match. Which they would if price was to fall from the 161. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5meh21jq4tg71.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ae4049c4ab49523b337d7f35d1a18a62fe4a3f

I want to reiterate, there is usually new news that comes along with big price moves, but to have done all the things required to flag up this area as the area in which you'd be most interested in shorting could all be done during 2020.  Like we can with MRNA today. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Updates when MRNA moves a bit. If it crashes it's really fucking up my example. 

&#x200B;

Model implies;

*  Long MRNA while under 390. Stop loss 330.
* Look for strong trending properties. 
* There will be sharp dips, these are good buys.
* Plan to short into 575 - 650 sort of zone, if price action is parabolic into here.
* Expect the news into the high to be positive for the asset, it usually is. 
* Often pop comes on bad news.",2021-08-11,58,48

Background:

After a volatile day typical of a low GEX print, I'd be lying if I didn't go into today's session with a slight upside bias for MRNA. Yesterday I had bought weekly exp 500c's with the intention to hold overnight following the bounce of $459.xx lvl.

I sold half of that position a little later into the day yesterday for a modest 60% profit, but blinded by my bias towards MRNA I chose to ignore a bunch of signals especially a sub optimal close, choosing instead to foolishly hold on to those contracts overnight.

BIG MISTAKE, as we discovered today at open. We gapped down below MRNA's $445 support, and opened at $443 with MRNA showing no intention of reclaiming $460. It was a great lesson and timely reminder in keeping my emotional biases in check and not wavering from my strategy. Yeah all these years into trading and the market never forgets to remind me to reign myself in, often harshly, when my head's getting too far up my ass.

&#x200B;

Trade setup:

1. With the sub $459.xx and $445 opens, the odds were stacked against MRNA bulls from the start.
2. It attempted to overcome $445 half heartedly on anemic volume and was promptly rejected
3. With $445 gone I knew a test of the Yellow Channel lower bound would be next

Playout:

1. Just like clockwork, MRNA wasted no time in sliding to the lower bound of the Yellow Channel

and more importantly chewed through the lvl without any sweat at all.

2. MRNA then proceeded to bear flag with now taking the channel support as resistance

3. On the break of the Bear Flag we visited $420 real quick, which also co-incided with

the upper bound of the green channel. Breaking through price channels takes a lot of volume/effort

on part of the participants which is why bounds of a price channel are contentious and offer massive support/resistance

4. We had a small bounce with decent volume here and I decided to exit my position here.

Background:

MRNA is a ticker I have been actively day trading since it was a mere $130. Overtime it has only gotten a more lucrative ticker to trade because of its high volatility and liquid options chain.

Trade setup:

After breaking out of it rising wedge on 07/16. MRNA has been trading in a nice steep channel. Right before its ER, MRNA was able to successfully break thru the $360 lvl which had proved to be a little sticky.

Buoyed by the momentum of breaking the $360 mark and a good reception to the ER providing further tailwind, MRNA flipped this channel into an even steeper one. It had a high volume break of this green channel and closed well above it.

On Friday, MRNA had a retest of support of this new yellow channel's lower bound, after having had sharp pull backs when testing the upper bound of this trend on the day prior, for support. Buyers stepped in and price closed well above the lower bound, and crucially also above Thursday's close.

Had this been any other ticker I would have not had such a bullish outlook but MRNA has a history of flipping trends so I wasn't too worried.

Entry:

1. Given the very optimistic close on Friday I had a bullish bias going into today.
2. I BTO MRNA 08/13 430c @ 10.5 per contract at 9:33 AM
3. This was followed by a high volume break of Wednesday's high
4. I increased by position further on the pullback right after that

Playout:

1. MRNA made a straight march for $440 right after that
2. Price pulled back here but on LOW volume
3. Ideally I would have taken profits on my position here but given how good the set up was due to Friday's close, I held on + the low volume pull back played a part
4. As tickers usually do when trying to set a new ATH or overcoming a significant resistance, they consolidate in a wedge or a flag or a pennant pattern with declining volume, as we get deeper into the pattern. Shorts who started selling when it hit previous ATH opened their positions here
5. MRNA displayed just that

Entry 2:

1. I bought 460c's as price settled into a structure since it was apparent that a break of the previous ATH was nigh.
2. BTO MRNA 460c @ 7.50 per contract at 10:10 AM
3. Proof of calling pennant formation and breakout: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pseudoku727/comments/p10xpw/scalping_thread_week_of_0809/h8advpv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Playout:

1. The reason for a bull pennant/flag to signify impending breakout is because it is a visual representation of trapped sellers and the breakout is set off by them covering their shorts
2. Like clockwork, the next time volume came in, MRNA zoomed past and set a new ATH
3. After that I stopped monitoring the play actively and let it float up to the upper bound of this trend
4. Any pullbacks/consolidation in this period were brief and low volume

Exit:

1. My take profit lvl was $460 since it was the upper bound of this trend
2. However, since my trade did reasonably well, I exited both my 430c and 460c positions at $457.
3. The reasoning behind that is MRNA has previously displayed sharp bounces off the upper bounds of channels. I didn't want to get caught on the wrong side of it

Trade technicals:

For 430c:

1. Time in 430c - Approx 90 min
2. Price of contract at entry - 10.50
3. Price of contract at exit - 32.50
4. Profit percentage - 210%

For 460c:

1. Time in 430c - Approx 60 min
2. Price of contract at entry - 7.5
3. Price of contract at exit - 18.5
4. Profit percentage - 150%

Trade rating:

9.5/10

p0p46j_MRNA,MRNA,Why are Moderna and Biontech priced so much higher than Pfizer?,"Hi everyone. Please forgive me if this question is simple but why is a share of Moderna or Biontech so much more expensive compared to their counterpart Pfizer? Biontech has a P/E of 64, Moderna has a P/E of 51 and Pfizer has a P/E of 19 so that explains the price differences on the surface but if like to understand why. Are Biontech and Moderna overvalued or Pfizer undervalued? Is there expectations for growth for the two companies but not Pfizer? I guess I'm looking for help in understanding the differences in the P/E in order to understand the stark differences in price. Thanks guys!

p01gam_MRNA,MRNA,The German mRNA developer Biontech will report earnings on Monday. How will they compare to Moderna?,"BioNTech

Germany-based BioNTech S.E. (NASDAQ: BNTX) is the co-developer (with Pfizer) of one of the COVID-19 vaccines. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 370%, and for the year to date, shares are 380%. The stock jumped about 9% on Wednesday following a report that the FDA would soon approve the vaccine, removing the emergency use authorization under which it has been distributed since late last year.


Another vaccine maker, Moderna, reported better-than-expected results Thursday morning and announced a $1 billion share buyback. Investors are never happy: the stock traded down about 2% afterward.

Analyst sentiment on BioNTech is decidedly cool. Of 12 brokerages covering the stock, eight have a Hold rating and the other four are evenly split between Buy and Sell ratings. The stock trades at around $392.50, more than double the median price target of $184.11 and just $6 (1.5%) below the high price target of $398.44.

For the second quarter, analysts expect BioNTech to report revenue of $3.88 billion, up 61.4% sequentially and 91% above the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS are forecast at $8.96, up 74% sequentially. In the second quarter of 2020, the company posted a loss per share of $0.38. For the full year, analysts are looking for EPS of $35.95, compared with a year-ago total of $0.07.

The stock trades at 9.8 times expected 2021 EPS, 10.8 times estimated 2022 earnings and 18.4 times estimated 2023 earnings. The stock’s 52-week range is $54.10 to $433.90. BioNTech does not pay a dividend.",2021-08-07,31,33

ov775j_MRNA,MRNA,Selling $MRNA naked call deep OTM,"Hello all,

I do moderate options trading but have never sold naked calls before. I usually do spreads and naked puts often. However, I found that selling very deep OTM Moderna 500C until August or September is a good idea. MRNA is currently very overpriced and I predict it will go down especially after earnings report. I only sold 1 contract because I like to play it safe. I understand that the risk is unlimited but will keep watching and close it at loss if I have to. I am also not planning to keep it until expiration but will close once hits \~40-50% profit.

opmbej_MRNA,MRNA,MRNA Soft TA - Buying P270 & P300 11/15 at Open,"Title should be 10/15 puts not november. Moving this from WSB to here, going to continue doing watchlists/analysis etc. Ended up selling the PUTS early this morning for $1500 gain after +2 Deviation support held.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, relative volatility index, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. Trading accuracy is now 84%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (second upper and lower purple lines), known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level. I generally use this to find stocks that are trading above +2 deviations to short/buy puts or at -2 deviations to buy calls/stock as these areas represent only 5% of the price action over a given time period and statistically, there's a 95% chance the price will drop back below or climb back above +2/-2 deviations, respectively. I did this with Amazon puts recently as AMZN was trading above +2deviations. Otherwise I mostly trade off deviation support and ride volume up to next deviation resistance level before exiting the position which is what these TAs will be about.

\-So, let's keep it simple stupid. Moderna, MRNA, is currently trading right along +2 deviation support on 6month chart, and right below +2deviation support on the daily(one year) chart. I've drawn red price level lines at these deviation support/resistance levels that carry over onto the one day chart. You'll need to download the charts to see the deviation levels.

First Image is the One Year and 6 month chart from right to left - [https://imgur.com/KZgqC2E](https://imgur.com/KZgqC2E)

This is the intraday chart with the same red price level deviation support/resistance lines carried over - [https://imgur.com/B7nOWox](https://imgur.com/B7nOWox)

We are BARELY holding +2 6month deviation support of around $215. At open today, I'll be buying $270 and $300 puts for October 15th.

Now, because deviation support is being held I expect there's a slight chance MRNA needs to complete its move up to +2deviation resistance on one year of $332 area before reversing, in which case, I'M JUST GONNA BUY MORE PUTS - [https://imgur.com/GG4hhCo](https://imgur.com/GG4hhCo)

\-Why $270 as my lower target? Because it's +1 Deviation on the One year chart. I could play the Mean/Average/Regression line (middle line on one year/6month/intraday) but I like to manage my risk and will be selling the PUTS once the price target of $272 area is reached (remember +1/-1deviation is blue lines on the charts) since this is the first statistical support area where the price may bounce a bit since we have deviation support on both one year and 6 month - [https://imgur.com/QyZlioQ](https://imgur.com/QyZlioQ)

o8pahs_MRNA,MRNA,Why is no one talking about $MRNA?,"A few reasons you should consider getting into $MRNA...  


* The stock has gone up consistently month over month after cyclical profit taking dips.
* It's one of the few vaccines that is being used globally and considered as the gold standard. 
* With the threat of the delta variant ever growing, MRNA tech will be all the more important. 
* Moderna is more than a vaccine play. They have projects ranging from HIV/AIDS to cancer treatments, and with the massive influx of vaccine fueled cash coming in, these projects will have an even higher chance of moving forward.
* It has not garnered much social attention (yet), getting in now before the retail social-media crowds do is always advantageous. 
* MRNA tech is still very very new, and the doors it could open in the future are endless. Moderna now being a household name means more trust will be given to them in comparison to other new MRNA tech companies. 
* Their freaking ticker is $MRNA. 

I've already made thousands on this, and will continue to hold for at least two years. This could easily jump to $400 by year end if current trend maintains itself.

nqnzgw_MRNA,MRNA,"MRNA ATH, sustainable? Discussion","MRNA current price: $193, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

ms81qo_MRNA,MRNA,Crunching some numbers on Moderna (MRNA) upcoming cash windfall,"I have had my eye on Moderna (MRNA) for a while and I decided to crunch some numbers on their upcoming windfall of cash from vaccine sales.  Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.

**MRNA**

Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)

Projected doses sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion

Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.

Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?

Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.

So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...

**Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**

\-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.

\-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.

\-Booster shot sales in the future?  AIDS vaccine?  CURE FOR CANCER??

**Overview**

This is going to be a long post, so I’m not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They’ve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they’ve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.

But Moderna isn’t just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna’s ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let’s talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.

**History of mRNA Technology**

mRNA was discovered in the 60’s in mice, but it wasn’t seriously considered for a possible therapeutic target until the 90’s. Various studies in vitro and in mice since this period have been done, demonstrating potential for the treatment of HIV, cancer, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease… I could go on. As we know, pharmaceuticals move slowly, and serious development of these products didn’t really take off until the 2010’s.^(2)

Prior to December 2020, there were only two medications utilizing mRNA technology that have received FDA approval. Inotersan and Patisiran were both developed and FDA approved in 2018 to treat a rare hereditary condition called hATTR which involves pathologic deposition of amyloid into the tissues of those affected. Without going into too much detail, this condition has a mean survival time of 15 years after diagnosis and leads to significant patient morbidity and suffering in the interim. Inotersan is the more successful of the two drugs and looks to be potentially curative for some patients with a disease which used to be a death sentence. Routine imaging since the phase III trials for Inotersan shows little to no progression of the disease in most patients, laying out the possibility that these patients may live a normal life moving forward.^(3)

With two more successful examples of mRNA technology being used in the COVID-19 vaccines, I expect that interest in the technology will skyrocket and subsequently so will funding and development.

**First Mover’s Advantage**

This will be a short section; Moderna is THE biggest player in developing mRNA therapeutics. There are other companies like BioNTech, CureVac, Gradalis, and Ionis, and of these only BioNTech (BNTX) can compete in sheer breadth of product development as well as having a history of success. For the sake of time I won’t address the other companies, but a key advantage that Moderna has over BioNTech is that they have moved more quickly through their clinical trials than BNTX has. Outside of COVID-19, Moderna currently has 4 products in Phase II trials (with their CMV vaccine moving to Phase III very soon), while BNTX only has 1.^(4) Long term I believe both of these companies will be highly successful, but Moderna is a more mature company that will be seeing the fruits of their labors more quickly than their competitor(s).

**The Future of COVID-19 Vaccination, and Vaccination in General**

Moderna currently has about 60% market share, distributing 40M of the 70M total doses the U.S. has received. I expect that number to drop slightly, but I would expect that Moderna ends up vaccinating approximately 40% of all Americans when it’s all said and done, with Pfizer vaccinating a large chunk of the rest. After that, Moderna will likely shift distribution to other countries and deliver on their agreements abroad.

“But what about NovaVax, J&J, and AstraZenica?” you might ask.

Without undercutting these companies and their potential, they are simply too late to the game in the U.S. to grab meaningful market share from Moderna and Pfizer.^(5,6) Johnson and Johnson was just recommended for authorization yesterday (2/26/2021) and will likely begin distribution in the coming weeks, however they are only expected to deliver 100M vaccines by the end of June. Moderna will deliver 300M by July^(7), on top of the approximately 40M they have already delivered. The U.S. has agreed to purchase more than 1.2B doses of the vaccine from a number of companies, but much of that will go overseas after American citizens have received their 2 doses.

Moderna is establishing relationships and trust globally with the successful development and distribution of their COVID-19 vaccine, but why is this important? Let’s think back to what the CEO said in their recent earnings call – Moderna is NOT a COVID-19 company. Digging into their therapeutics pipeline, we can see mRNA candidates targeting Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, Nipah Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Epstein-Barr, Zika, Chikungunya… Relationships established during this pandemic will serve them well in the development and distribution of future vaccine candidates like those listed above.

WAIT there’s more: back in January, Moderna announced plans to create a combination Influenza/COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of adding more candidates to the mix if they were to receive approval. With the number of viruses that they are targeting, Moderna has the potential to become the leader in vaccination globally, period. Their ability to create combination vaccines targeting a host of common viruses could be the new standard in vaccination. Certain candidates like RSV, CMV, and EBV are likely to become standard vaccinations given in childhood like other vaccines we are familiar with such as MMR and Varicella.

The potential of this company in the vaccination industry is endless, and right now they are just scratching the surface.

**Future Revenue Projections – $18 Billion --> ???**

During their most recent earnings call, Moderna reported that they have orders for their vaccine totaling $18 billion^(8), and they are expecting more orders throughout the year. The COVID vaccine market is likely to cool off a little after that, but experts currently predict that COVID-19 boosters will become a routine part of care in the future, likely needing a new dose every 2-3 years.^(9) Now this would likely represent a major hit to revenue if Moderna was just a COVID-19 vaccine company but once again, they are not.

Lets briefly talk about a virus you may have never heard of before – cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is something you’ve likely had in the past and didn’t know it, so why is it a problem? Oddly enough, this seemingly benign little virus causes about 25,000 birth defects per year in the U.S. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 1000 babies will be born with a birth defect due to CMV.

Currently there is no vaccine, but do you know who has the most promising candidate that is already enrolling participants for phase III trials? You guessed it – Moderna. The addressable market for this vaccine is conservatively estimated at $2-5 billion/year.^(10) I expect that if it is approved by the FDA that it will likely see global adoption and that revenue number is likely to be much higher.

Repeat the above for RSV, EBV, Zika, etc. and it is not hard to envision a company that is bringing in $30-50 billion a year in annual vaccination income alone. If they were to succeed in any of their more lofty quests to develop an HIV vaccine, or therapeutics for autoimmune hepatitis, or personalized cancer vaccines… the sky is the limit.

**Justifying Current Valuation, and Then Some**

Moderna’s current market cap is 62.16B. Their orders for 2021 currently exceed $18B with room to grow. The average revenue multiple for a biotech company is between 6-8x, and Moderna is trading at less than 4x. If you consider Moderna a pharmaceutical company, than the average multiple would be about 5x, still under.^(11)

I know we are looking at unrealized revenue with Moderna at this point, as that $18B will be earned throughout the year, so I understand that technically speaking they are still trading at an obscene P/S ratio compared to other more mature companies. However, I think it’s safe to say that demand for their product isn’t going away anytime this year and they have proven that they are able to execute and even exceed expectations when it comes to manufacturing and distributing their product.

Looking at their most recent earnings report for Q420 which was released on 2/25/21, their balance sheet is stellar. They are holding around $3B in cash from recent deposits, and they have almost no debt to speak of.

Simply put, they are undervalued at their current price. Without even factoring in the potential of everything else in their pipeline, they should be worth more as just a COVID-19 company with stellar financials and a relatively palatable multiple going into the later part of this year.

My personal price target: $220/share. With 396M outstanding shares, a $220 share price would place Moderna at $87B, which I believe to be a fair valuation through this year. This would represent a 4.8x multiple to their projected revenue in 2021. This represents a 41% increase in price from where Moderna is trading at currently which is \~$155/share.

**Closing**

Understand that this company has enormous potential for growth, but also potential to fail. Most pharmaceutical products fail in clinical trials before ever reaching market, and the same could be true for most if not all of Moderna’s pipeline. I personally believe that mRNA products have a higher chance of success than traditional therapeutics, but I’m not going to go into my reasoning for that in this post.

Every trade carries risk, and the risk with buying Moderna is that the market for COVID-19 vaccines shrinks as the world gradually develops herd immunity, the rest of their products fail in clinical trials, and they die a slow death without ever bringing another product to market. Nonetheless, I am confident and hopeful that this will not happen, and Moderna will become the next company to join the ranks of Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and company as a true juggernaut of the biotech/pharma sector.

*Disclosures: I own shares in Moderna, and I am considering buying leaps at some point next week. I am not a financial advisor, always do your own due diligence before investing in the market.*

lul3dx_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna (MRNA) DD – Why a 60B Company is Still Undervalued,"\*This will be my first DD post so let me know if you would like to hear about anything I didn’t touch on, or if you disagree on any particular points. Hopefully you find it useful!

**Overview**

This is going to be a long post, so I’m not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They’ve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they’ve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.

But Moderna isn’t just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna’s ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let’s talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.

**History of mRNA Technology**

If anybody has any knowledge about this topic please let me know",2020-11-20,5,15
jvyqlu_MRNA,MRNA,NVAX as mRNA vaccines are not safe,"Both PFE and MRNA have produced mRNA vaccines. The way these vaccines work is that they inject a mRNA segment coated with a protein sheath. The protein sheath gets the mRNA inside our healthy cells. The protein factories in these cells read the mRNA and produce the spike protein and die in the process. As they die they release the spike protein into the blood stream. Now our immune system sees the spike protein and creates antibodies to the spike protein. Later when the SARS COV2 virus enters the body the antibodies attack the virus as they already recognize the spike protein as bad.

Now compare with traditional vaccines  - we introduce a dead or weakened form of the virus. Immune system recognizes the virus and creates antibodies.

Now compare NVAX vaccine. No mRNA or virus is introduced. Instead the spike protein is grown in vats and the spike protein is injected. Immune system sees the spike protein and creates antibodies.

So why do I think the NVAX approach is better than the mRNA or traditional approach

Traditional approach takes time - years to create a weaker form of the virus so NVAX beats that from a time perspective

But the mRNA approach really scares me. We are taking over the cell machinery of healthy cells and turning them into virus protein factories. What happens when something goes wrong in the process?

Say the cell we are taking over already is infected with HIV. The cell factories are busy turning out copies of HIV. Now we infect it with the mRNA and it starts producing spike proteins. Random mutations do happen especially when creating proteins and viruses foreign to our system. Say randomly a copy of the HIV virus gets created with the COV2 spike protein attached. The spike protein is what makes COV2 so infectious so now we have a virus with the infectiousness of Covid and the deadliness of AIDS and this ""vaccinated"" individual is walking around shedding this virus. Which means HIV could be transmitted through the air.

Another scenario - autoimmune disorders. In people who suffer autoimmune disorders like lupus or arthritis the immune system gets confused and attacks our own cells. Well now we are adding to the confusion. We are changing cells in our own body to create a foreign protein. What if the immune system instead of creating immunity to the spike protein creates immunity to our own cells. Our own antibodies start killing off cells in our own brain. We have created early onset Alzheimers. Sure these folks will seem to be protected from COVID in vaccine trials of 2-3 months duration but 2-3 years down the line they wont be able to remember their own name or use the bathroom without help.

mRNA vaccines are just too dangerous which is why the technology has been stuck for 10 years. No way to know its safe wthout large scale and long term trials and no way to ethically justify such a trial (except of course if you are in the middle of a pandemic)

So mRNA could work but also PFE and MRNA and CVAC could get sued into bankruptcy a few years from now (And now you understand why the Republicans are desperate to get liability shield for COVID treatment into any Stimulus package. Without such a package passing neither MRNA nor PFE will actually start vaccination)

NVAX nanoparticle vaccine avoids the risk of autoimmune disorders or frankenstein viruses. Plus they dont need a specialized cold chain.

Finally the CanSino, Sputnik and AZN vaccines use a genetically modified common cold virus to produce the spike protein. It wont work for anyone who has already had the common cold as the delivery vector will get destroyed before it has a chance to takeover cells to produce the spike protein due to their eisting immunity to the Adenovirus vector.

India is working on a traditional vaccine but that will take at least another 18 months

&#x200B;

So from a speed, logistics and safety perspective NVAX has the best vaccine.",2020-11-17,17,69

# Short or Long Setups

**$PLUG**

Massive multiday rip with a spinning top candle 11/12. Could signal a reversal, and see a nice dump below LOD. Could also catch shorts sleeping and squeeze above HOD. Either play I'd be scalping and taking most profits off the table pretty quickly. As with all names, don't anticipate, wait for key levels break.

**$PTON**

Gap down with some tailing dojis on a bounce. Today we closed just over 50D SMA. If this holds and we break 11/12 HOD, could see nice move into gap fill territory. If we break back below 50D SMA, there's not much room before 11/12 LOD, and no support until 99.83. Nice pockets on both sides.

# Trade 1: $QDEL short +$1711.43

Trade thesis: Bear flag on the daily chart, yesterday closed towards lows, looking for any weakness out of the gate to go short w/ target below yesterday LOD.

Trade execution: Out of the gate we get a nice clean dump below VWAP. I jump in full size. I start profit taking on the move down, holding half size into break below yesterday's LOD. Scale out as we confirm break through YLOD, and get stopped out on final 1/8th of position w/ trailing stop.

Lessons/Takeaways: I'm pleased with me execution, but I'd be very hesitant to trade this name again. Within minutes of open, spread became abysmal and volume started drying up. Too risky for the kind of size I trade with.

# Trade 2: $PTON short +$266.38

Trade thesis: Looking like a potential daily bear flag and forming a tightening range below VWAP while struggling to break 50D SMA. 

Trade execution: Went short with small size on first 1m candle to break low. I wanted to see a break down below LOD and we didn't get it, so I covered on the way back up. 

Lessons/Takeaways: I don't regret exiting this trade even though it ended up dumping later. The break back over 50D SMA and VWAP would've been way too bullish for me to be holding short, and this would've been a losing trade had I not exited. By the time it came back down, I had moved on to other names.

# Trade 3: $MRNA long +$549.81

Trade thesis: In a daily up trend heading towards all time highs. 7$ pocket between 11/12 HOD and all time highs. Looking for a break through 11/12 HOD and a squeeze into area of no resistance. 

Trade execution: Took full size on break through yesterday HOD. Exited half on rejection of $88.50 to lock in profits. Exited another 1/4 below $89. Threw a $0.80 trailing stop on and got stopped out quickly.

Lessons/Takeaways: Solid execution overall. A little trigger happy on the sell below $88.50, but that topping tail made me jumpy. 

https://preview.redd.it/hs1nvdf481z51.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e5e8764074802b8d67fbf6eb65bd60d9910758

# Trade 4: $BABA short +$474.81

Trade thesis:  In a sharp daily downtrend. Multiple rejections off \~$272 100D SMA resistance with a close near the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD and 4H bear flag confirmation. On intraday, grinding between yesterday LOD, today LOD, and VWAP. Looking for clean break below today LOD.

Trade execution: Took half size on break below LOD. Covered above low of dip. Covered 1/4 on mini 1m bear flag confirmation, stopped out on remaining position. 

Lessons/Takeaways: Happy with execution over all. Could've added on break below low of dip. Could've also had wider trailing stop. Used a $1 trail instead of my normal 1%, which would be $2.60ish. 

https://preview.redd.it/3blhp3rjd1z51.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fd2f80ff9b48ca4f5e99357c8481447d88665e9

# Trade 5: $NIO short +$839.26

Trade thesis: Had this on the watchlist as a potential momentum long. Noticed a blow off top (tailing top candle on top of a parabolic move) on the daily chart. Saw 2 potential short entry points and a head and shoulders look. 

Trade execution: Took half size starter position on first 1m candle to make new low on VWAP rejection. Added to full size on confirmation of imperfect head and shoulders. Covered 1/2 into initial dump. Break even level has plenty of cushion now. Covered another 1/4th into next leg down. Made a good lot of my profits on the last leg down with a $0.50 trailing stop.  

Lessons/Takeaways: Probably my cleanest execution out of all 5 trades today. If you follow me, you'll notice many times the trailing stop on the last 1/4 or 1/8 position doesn't always add to my profit, but it never cuts deep into my losses. It's trades like these that make that strategy pay off. \~Half the gain came from that final quarter position.

gmz190_MRNA,MRNA,The Case Against Moderna,"There's been a lot of talk (most of it bullish) about Moderna, the biotech company with the first Covid-19 vaccine in the pipeline. I think a vaccine can be developed, but there doesn't seem to be enough skepticism about Moderna's chance of pulling it off. Even after today's 10 percent drop, the company has a $26 billion market cap, more than 3x the pre-Covid-19 value, which was itself speculative.

The gist of the bear case is that:

\-No one has ever developed an mRNA vaccine (it's cool tech that may or may not work) and Moderna has never brought a drug to market.

\-Moderna hasn't published much data about any of its research and nothing meaningful about the corona virus vaccine.

\-The phase 1 trial is just a safety trial -- it's a not big hurdle for a vaccine candidate to pass. The results that n = 8 test subjects had neutralizing antibodies is a far bigger deal and some of yesterday's run up was justified. But there were no numbers and there's always reasons for skepticism when you don't have a control arm ( as is the case in a phase 1 trial).

\-Again mRNA vaccines are thought to be less stable than protein based vaccines. A protein based vaccine is a safer bet.

Or do you believe the experts statements that vaccine trials could take a year to a year and a half?","Dr Anthony Fauci leads the NIAID, has seen this country through many outbreaks,  From the HIV/AIDS outbreak in the 80's when it was still referred to as GRID, and has also seen us through more modern outbreaks such as the avian flu, SARS, MERS, and now Covid19.  With many influenza outbreaks in between.  He's no stranger to fast tracking the FDA approval process for both therapeutic drug candidates, and for vaccine candidates, while also ensuring the safe administration of these interventions within the context of ethical medicine.  


When the president needs to be corrected about the vaccine timeline during task force meetings multiple times by CEO's of pharmaceutical companies, and by Dr Fauci himself, does anyone here believe that a vaccine could actually come to market within the Presidents proposed timeline of 2 months at the soonest?  The experts are saying 1 to 1.5 years, if it's fast tracked.   
\> Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White house news conference on Feb. 26: “So although this is the fastest we have ever gone from a sequence of a virus to a trial, it still would not be applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year and a half.”   


The bottom line is that one the short term drug therapy is a more exciting and promising treatment for Covid19, even assuming drug trials actually work.  If Covid19 stays around for longer than a year, then a vaccine would be a promising treatment as well, but its not possible to predict if this outbreak will be recurring, or a one time event.   So if you think this outbreak is going to linger for more than a year, by all means hold these companies.  If this particular virus is just a one time event, and doesn't come back as the same strain in the next 2,4,6 years, these vaccine trials will likely be sunken costs.

During the 2015 ebola scare GILD shot up to about $120, and its vaccine was not even working. This time is a different story, however. They used their drug remdesivir on a man from Washington in an emergency situation earlier this year and he showed good signs of improvement. 

Clinical trial of remdesivir began today, 2/25. Trial per patient will last up to 10 day’s total. “Initially, investigators will compare participant outcomes on day 15 in both the remdesivir group and the placebo group to see if the investigational drug increased clinical benefit compared to placebo.” 

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins

People don’t understand the advantages that remdesivir has over other its competition. Basically, it decreases the viral load without the drawbacks of facilitated entry into cells using MAB.

MRNA was up almost 40% at its peak today because of news stating it would be ready for human trials in April. GILD’s remdesivir could be a treatment before then. China will announce the results of their remdesivir trials on April 27th, but information probably be leaked by then. Occasionally these trials get stopped early. There are two reasons - 1. the drug is clearly worse than the controls or 2. its clearly better than the control and its unethical for the controls not to get the drug.
