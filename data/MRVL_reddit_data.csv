1kgy14z_MRVL,MRVL,Marvell Technology : it's over ?,"Hello everyone,

I am invested in Marvell Technology because I had confidence in their potential to stand out in the custom chip market, which is a strong trend with various announcements from major tech companies seeking independence from Nvidia. However, even today, the stock is down -10%, just like during the Q4 results release, which wasn’t bad. It feels like I’m reliving the same nightmare as with AMD. I heard that the postponement of a conference tanked the stock today. I just want to sell everything and find more attractive investments...

1jxe2ti_MRVL,MRVL,My amateurish attempt at pricing/Relative Valuation (MRVL),"This is for ACADEMIC PURPOSES and it is NOT financial advice.

This is my first ever relative valuation model. As I’m still learning, I hope to one day incorporate both relative and intrinsic valuation in my own analysis. During the making of this model, I’ve had many doubts. I’d appreciate any and all forms of advice, criticisms and feedback.

Here is a link to my model in google sheets : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MubnGBt9srx36aNuc7-XD7SzZa9rAUjDc3wiFWd\_tD8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MubnGBt9srx36aNuc7-XD7SzZa9rAUjDc3wiFWd_tD8/edit?usp=sharing)

The comparables I’ve selected for the fabless semiconductor company Marvell Technologies are acknowledged as competitors that directly compete with MRVL’s business (Stated in the 10-K). There are a total of 22 companies (including MRVL) and I used ChatGPT to help me pick companies that resemble the closest to MRVL, which brought the sample size down to 8. Would that be a reasonable number? Or would you rather have just simply priced all of its comparables?

Most of the financial data was obtained from Yahoo Finance. One of the main problems that I encounter using data from this is that the fiscal year ending date varies for each comparable. This enables a problem of inconsistency. How should I go about this?

The EV/EBITDA value for MRVL is abnormally high compared to its peers. Additionally, its net income for fiscal year 2023 and 2024 is negative which gives rise to a negative P/E ratio (I use Market Cap / Net Income ). Would these valuation metrics remain feasible to use? Or rather, perhaps there are better alternatives suited for these companies? How about Dividend Yield or EV / FCF?

A relative valuation model does not dictate the true value of a company but rather, it acts as a proxy for how the market perceives it relative to its peers. With reference to my model, if you’re considering investing in MRVL, you are better off investing in QCOM instead. While QCOM’s profitability metrics are mediocre compared to NVDA, its valuation metrics remain an attractive option. Do note that this model DOES NOT account for tariffs and market uncertainty (I’m not sure yet of how to incorporate it into these valuation metrics).

If any of you have ideas on how to optimize the format, or a better idea to justify investing in another company over the other in a detailed manner, I’d love for you to share your insights.

It's the 4th quarter right now, where champions are made, where destinies are determined. Let's finish this season strong baby. Am I the only one who is sensing a deja vu moment right now? LMND & AAP (0/2) -> SNOW, AI & PARA (3/3)???

Today Ive got 2 companies that I’ll be gambling on, they both report right after the bell today: Marvell Technology & MongoDB.

&#x200B;

1. **MRVL** \- I've never heard of them, you've never heard of them, but these fellas make semiconductors. Chips -> AI -> BRRRRRRR. I'm getting ARM vibes off this one. Add to this, one of my favorite movies is Avengers Infinity War. Even though I've only watched like 3 Marvel movies before seeing this one, it was very very entertaining. They got a dwarf playing a dwarf on a dwarf planet; now that's called good writing. Earnings are gonna be marvelous tonight boys
2. **MDB** \- Okay so MongoDB is a software company, and we all know what that means..... Yes I messed it up with CRWD, but that one was Wall Street's dark horse to save the industry. Aside from CRWD & NET, software/cloud companies keep getting slaughtered after earnings, and I know not all cloud companies are the same, but who the fuck cares, they all keep going tits up. It aint gon be different tonight, so expect red dildos.

Here’s an example of using the expected move to generate an Iron Condor that “sells the move” in GME. The Condor looks to profit if GME stays within its expected move following earnings. It is a max gain between 195 and 297.50. If the stock moves beyond what options are pricing, the Condor is a max loss (with defined risk) below 190 or above 302.50:

Trading directionally can also use the expected move to establish debit spreads to those levels in the stock. Any OTM calls or puts beyond those levels need a stock move beyond what options are pricing. Skew in the meme stocks is off the charts, as retail is reaching for OTM calls in particular way beyond what options are pricing. That can work in a traders favor to sell those OTM options to help finance closer to the money options.

msx9ff_MRVL,MRVL,MRVL INPHI Merger,"Thoughts on this MRVL play?

https://investor.marvell.com/news-releases/news-release-details/shareholders-approve-proposed-acquisition-inphi-corporation

POS: 4/23 50$c 

Marvell confirmed today with a shareholder meeting their merger with INPHI. I’m thinking given this news that share price will rise in light of this news. 5G communications is on the rise and they are a great investment long term anyways.

Additionally, this transaction is expected to close around April 20th 2020.

Happy Trading",2021-04-17,7,1

mjc5le_MRVL,MRVL,MRVL acquisition date 4/15 play,"I am looking to get into MRVL on Monday in light of their recent shareholder meeting coming up on 4/15.

This meeting will cover a potential date for the acquisition of Inphi and this news could boost MRVL prices.

Unusual options prices for 55 and 60 Strike prices indicate potential moves to the upside in light of this shareholder meeting. 

Here’s an article to check out on the meeting:

llvban_MRVL,MRVL,DD $MRVL - Marvell Technology Group,"I try daily to focus on the best companies and to invest constantly in their potential. With that said, today I will focus on the 5G sector, where the huge potential of companies competing in this field I think is not yet met. My choice is for a company from Hamilton, Bermuda, $MRVL – Marvell Technology Group Ltd., founded in 1995. Don't confuse it with the cartoon franchise. 

$Marvell designs, develops, and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. It offers a portfolio of Ethernet solutions, including controllers, network adapters, physical transceivers, and switches; single or multiple core processors; custom application specific integrated circuits; and printer SoC products and application processors. The company also provides a range of storage products comprising storage controllers for hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives that support various host system interfaces consisting of serial attached SCSI (SAS), serial advanced technology attachment (SATA), peripheral component interconnect express, non-volatile memory express (NVMe), and NVMe over fabrics; and fiber channel products, including host bus adapters, and controllers for server and storage system connectivity. 

It has operations in the United States, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. With its profile, it is normal that the company to be involved heavily in the 5G sector, which presents great opportunities for growth. This new industry has yet to reach maturity and companies present in the market try heavily to invest in innovation and in conquering as much market share as possible. Main competitors of $MRVL are strong also ($Micron, $qualcomm etc), but there is a shortage of reliable solutions, a lot of room to develop and occupy niches and market gaps. I think that those who will put a strong foot now, at the dawn of the 5G era, in this industry, have a lot of growth potential. 

Now, $MRVL it has a P/E Ratio (TTM) of 24.26 and an EPS of 2.18. The next earnings release is scheduled for 2nd March. Analysts expect Marvell earnings of 29 cents a share, up 71% year over year, on sales of $794.7 million, up 11%. If it hits those numbers, it will mark its fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. The company is benefiting from a cyclical upturn in semiconductor sales. I do not think this stock is overvalued and with a price right now if $52, a price target of $55 and a high estimate of $64, there is a lot of room to gain. It is normal to consider it a good buy entry point and I will invest for the next months. 

Thank you for reading and your feedback is welcomed!

Considering Nokia has earnings this Thursday before open, I'm almost certain they will mention their expansion into 5G and shine the light into their partnership with Marvell. Premiums are pretty reasonable at the moment too.
