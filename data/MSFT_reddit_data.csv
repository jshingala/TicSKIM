1kk7jrp_MSFT,MSFT,OpenAI in talks with Microsoft ($MSFT) to secure funding & prep for IPO,"Just read that OpenAI is renegotiating its deal with Microsoft to raise more funding and potentially clear the path for an IPO. Microsoft already has over $13B invested, but they’re reportedly working on restructuring the partnership — possibly giving up some revenue share or extending access to OpenAI tech beyond 2030.

This could be huge. OpenAI staying under nonprofit control while still planning for more for-profit funding is a rare structure. If they pull this off, it could unlock major value not just for OpenAI, but also for Microsoft shareholders.

If OpenAI eventually goes public, does that increase the long-term value case for $MSFT? Curious what other value investors think here — is this a moat builder or a distraction?",2025-05-11,41,9
1khsmh6_MSFT,MSFT,"OpenAI, Microsoft, AMD To Present Senate With AI Wishlist To Beat China","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is expected to emphasize the need for public investment in infrastructure, while Microsoft President Brad Smith would reportedly highlight concerns around export restrictions on U.S. AI chips.

Top executives from OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and CoreWeave (CRVW) are scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday, urging lawmakers to back policies that strengthen the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence (AI) amid rising competition from China.

The hearing, led by Senator Ted Cruz, comes as Washington faces renewed pressure to counter advances by Chinese firms. 

Last year, DeepSeek—a Hangzhou-based company—surprised the global tech community by unveiling a capable, lower-cost AI model that challenged OpenAI and Meta Platforms (META) offerings.

U.S. tech leaders have since stepped up lobbying efforts, arguing that AI aligned with democratic norms is a strategic imperative. The industry wants looser regulations and increased support for critical infrastructure such as semiconductors and supercomputing capacity.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is expected to emphasize the need for public investment in infrastructure. 

“Infrastructure is destiny, and we need a lot more of it,” he is expected to say, according to his prepared remarks cited by Reuters. Altman, who in earlier testimony before Congress advocated strong regulation to mitigate AI risks, now says scaling AI requires “more chips, training data, energy, and supercomputers.”

Microsoft President Brad Smith would reportedly highlight concerns that export restrictions on U.S. AI chips could push global buyers toward Chinese alternatives. 

AMD CEO Lisa Su and CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator would also pressure lawmakers to back policies supporting U.S.-based AI development.

The Biden administration’s sweeping curbs on AI chip exports to China aimed to limit Beijing’s military advancement. However, the Trump administration is preparing to rescind those controls. 

According to a report by Bloomberg, Trump will not enforce the Biden-era “AI diffusion rule” when it takes effect on May 15, part of a broader plan to overhaul semiconductor trade restrictions that have drawn industry backlash.

U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips to China have caused major revenue losses for chipmakers. AMD expects up to $800 million in charges related to unsellable inventory and commitments, while Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion write-down due to its H20 chips being blocked from the Chinese market.

“The way to beat China in the AI race is to outrace them in innovation, not saddle AI developers with European-style regulations,” Cruz said when announcing the hearing.

AMD’s stock is down over 15% year-to-date, while Nvidia shares have dropped nearly 14%.",2025-05-08,16,2

1kf7rk5_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft Stock Lands Rare Downgrade After ‘Exceptional’ Quarter — But It Has Nothing To Do With Fundamentals: Retail’s Bullish,"The firm believes that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence models.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has gained 10% over the two sessions since it reported its third-quarter results. 

Friday’s close of $435.28 meant Microsoft stock has turned positive for the year with a year-to-date gain of 3.5%.

Notwithstanding the investor optimism over the Satya Nadella-led company, an analyst downgraded the stock on Sunday. The Fly reported that research firm Phillip Securities downgraded the Microsoft stock to ‘Accumulate’ from ‘Buy’ but left the price target unchanged at $480.

The firm attributed the downgrade to the stock rally amid the recent market upturn and the company’s earnings.

Phillip Securities analysts, however, believe that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence (AI) models, which in turn enhances the attractiveness of the Azure public cloud platform.

The firm also sees minimal impact from the Trump tariffs, given Microsoft’s strong enterprise customer base and the accent on its cloud service.

Microsoft stock is still trading off its all-time high of $467.70, hit on July 8, 2024.

Last Wednesday, Microsoft reported a solid third-quarter beat and issued positive guidance. The company also said it expects strong Azure revenue growth and a sequential increase in capital spending.

Following the results, Microsoft analysts hiked their price targets, with the new targets ranging from $475 to $550. Analysts called the quarter an “exceptional one.”",2025-05-05,28,8

* **Revenue:** $70.07 billion vs. $68.42 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.

The company said Azure revenue grew 33%, with 16 points of the growth associated with AI. Analysts polled by StreetAccount and CNBC had anticipated 30.3% and 29.7% Azure growth, respectively.

During the quarter, which ended on March 31, Microsoft announced an adjustment to its relationship with key AI partner OpenAI.

1k0citt_MSFT,MSFT,"Microsoft - buy or hold, depends on your time horizon","Been analyzing Microsoft's current position and wanted to share some insights alongside valuation metrics from valuesense.io. This is a deep dive that looks beyond surface metrics to unpack the risk/reward dynamics.

Microsoft remains a blue-chip cornerstone, currently comprising over 6% of the S&P 500's total weight. Since the start of 2022, MSFT has delivered an 8% total return (including dividends) - essentially matching its dividend yield on an annualized basis of 2-3%.

# Revenue Driver Analysis

Two primary growth engines:

**1. Productivity and Business Processes ($29.4B in Q2)**

* 14% YoY growth
* Incredibly sticky revenue model with high switching costs
* Microsoft 365 ecosystem continues expanding through cross-selling
* AI initiatives already exceeding $13B annual run rate

**2. Intelligent Cloud ($25.5B in Q2)**

* Azure continues capturing significant market share
* Cloud sector projected to maintain \~20% growth trajectory
* Microsoft's positioning here remains exceptionally strong

**3. More Variable Segments**

* Gaming division (post-Activision)
* Windows OEM business

Projections indicate close to double-digit revenue growth with potentially stronger EPS performance due to efficiency initiatives.

# Valuation Framework

Currently trading at 25.7x forward earnings, below the 10-year average of 27x.

**Recent** [**valuesense.io**](http://valuesense.io) **metrics provide additional perspective:**

* Intrinsic Value: $427.4 (suggesting 10.2% undervaluation)
* DCF Value: $379.3
* P/E (LTM): 31.1x
* P/FCF: 41.2x
* FCF Yield: 2.4%
* PEG Ratio: 2.9x
* Reverse DCF implies 12.3% FCF growth expectations

Interestingly, traditional value investing approaches show significantly lower fair values:

* Peter Lynch fair value: $162.9
* Ben Graham fair value: $191.4

For those with longer horizons:

* FY2026 projected EPS: $15 (4.2% earnings yield)
* At 13% annual EPS growth, earnings yield approaches 7% by 2030
* The EPV (Earnings Power Value) at 35.6% of EV suggests much of Microsoft's valuation relies on future growth rather than current earnings power

Why?



Microsoft is like a big tech etf due to the largest quantity of business sectors, just go look at their quarterly revenue streams by sector. Compare that to a company like Nvidia which generates most of their revenue from data centers its night and day. Microsoft has a hand in almost every sector of tech. 

  
I also work with microsoft tools everyday in my job as a system administrator and they have such a grip on business operations (think O365, domains for your workplace all that good stuff) that they can essentially price licenses and other necessary products at whatever they want.

* Cloud and AI are major growth drivers, with Azure revenue up 31% YoY and AI services growing 157%-175%.

Microsoft (MSFT) is maintaining its market leadership worth nearly $2.96 trillion. The market cap of its stocks is currently $2.96 trillion, currently trading at $402.85, reflecting its stable and firm trend over this year, ranging between $385.58 and $468.35 during a 52-week trading. While there have been minute movements in its stocks, its trend in total is generally sideways. Financially, Microsoft performed well in FY 2024, with its revenues improving 15.7% yearly, amounting to $245.1 billion, and earnings improving 21.8% to stand at $88.1 billion. The company’s consistent numbers support its growth prospects in its business divisions. Despite the challenges of escalating capital investment and increasing competition in AI, Microsoft's strategic investment in AI and cloud continues to drive growth. They are well positioned for stability in the long term and success in the future in a transforming technology landscape due to their investment in AI solutions, business solutions, and growth in the cloud.

Microsoft’s collaboration with AI models will offer the company tremendous growth in the near future. Since the explosion of AI, the Microsoft Azure program has become invaluable to other enterprises looking to integrate AI into their platforms. The high quality of Azure’s programs is a massive growth driver for MSFT. It has experienced a YoY revenue growth of 31%, which is over 3 percent above the predicted 5-year CAGR of AI models. Microsoft Cloud itself also experienced a notable 21% YoY increase in revenue and 12% growth in revenue in Q2. In January of this year, MSFT gained permission to add the Open AI model to their neural network, Copilot. These companies’ collaboration takes advantage of the $13B revenue run rate (predicting future revenue based on a company’s current revenue) of AI models and their YoY growth of 157%–175%. MSFT’s AI programs will gain huge amounts of revenue from the 345 million users using its services.

Microsoft is making a massive investment in its future, expecting to spend around $80 billion on capital expenditures this year - nearly double what it spent just a couple of years ago ($44–$55 billion). Most of this money is going toward building AI-powered data centers and expanding its cloud infrastructure, ensuring the company stays ahead in the rapidly evolving tech space. In the short term, this aggressive spending is putting pressure on free cash flow (FCF), which was about $70 billion over the past year and even saw a 29% drop year-over-year in Q2 FY25. But Microsoft is playing the long game—by fiscal 2026, FCF is expected to recover to $82.38 billion as these investments start paying off. This is a familiar playbook for Microsoft, much like when it bet big on cloud computing years ago. The short-term financial squeeze is real, but the payoff could be enormous, setting Microsoft up for 15+ years of sustained growth and solidifying its position as a leader in AI and cloud computing.

In terms of current valuation metrics, Microsoft's current stock price as of February 1st, 2025, is 121.95, and the forward P/E ratio is 33.4x. Additionally, its expected earnings per share (EPS) for Fiscal Year 2026 is $15.04, as well as a 12-month target price of $490, based on earnings growth and valuation expectations. In terms of projected price target calculations, the standard valuation formula is used, and via the given EPS for 2026 and P/E ratio, it is projected that the stock price by the end of fiscal 2026 will be approximately $500. This, however, is under the pretext that Microsoft maintains a P/E ratio of 33.4x. Stock valuation fluctuates based on market conditions; thus, if the market decides that Microsoft deserves a lower valuation, for instance, a P/E ratio of 30 instead of 33.4, the target price would change, falling to around $451. This suggests that if Microsoft’s stock trades at a more conservative multiplier, the price might be closer to $451 instead of $500. Microsoft's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is at 13.3%, meaning that Microsoft's stock would be growing at a healthily above-average rate compared to the broader market. Microsoft's cloud computing (Azure) and AI services are key growth drivers as AI-related revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion annually, growing at 175% year-over-year. The growth of overall revenue, at approximately 12-13% per year, supports earnings growth. The growth margins are expected to be 68-70% in FY 2025 and FY 2026, indicating profitability, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $65 billion in FY 2025 and $72 billion in FY 2026, meaning that Microsoft has money to reinvest or return to shareholders. However, risks include the fact that their valuation relies heavily on AI expansion; therefore, if AI adoption slows, the stock might not meet growth targets. Additionally, a declining P/E ratio could bring the price closer to $431 instead of $500. Competition also plays a key role, as rivals such as Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also growing their AI and cloud businesses, which could impact Microsoft's market share and interest rates. Finally, economic conditions influence investor sentiment, ultimately affecting stock valuation. Overall, Microsoft remains a strong investment, but future performance depends on AI adoption, earnings growth, and maintaining investor confidence.

Microsoft integrates security into its cloud and AI strategy with a Zero Trust approach, AI-driven threat intelligence, and a unified security platform. Its key security solutions include Microsoft Defender, an AI-powered XDR for endpoints, cloud, and email; Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR for real-time threat detection; and Microsoft Entra, an IAM solution with multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance. Microsoft’s cybersecurity business is rapidly growing, generating over $20 billion annually at a double-digit rate, serving 785,000+ customers, and investing $1 billion+ annually in security research and development. AI-driven security processes 65 trillion signals daily, enabling real-time threat mitigation. This robust security framework strengthens Azure adoption, AI deployments, and enterprise trust, making security a growth driver rather than an add-on. By embedding security across its cloud ecosystem, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in cybersecurity while accelerating Azure and AI innovation.

TL;DR: Microsoft maintains market leadership with a stable stock price, driven by AI and cloud growth. Heavy CapEx investment impacts short-term cash flow but positions the company for long-term gains. Valuation suggests a price target of \~$500 by FY2026, but risks include free cash flow declines and AI adoption uncertainty. Quantum computing advancements and a strong cybersecurity ecosystem further solidify Microsoft’s market strength.",2025-02-28,10,3

The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2025-02-28,2656,300

I'm trying to understand where the flow of money is coming from; debt is not cheap as monetary policy has led to interest rate hikes and, now, a hold. I don't believe the US Federal Reserve is QE'ing right now and are either attempting to lower/sustain their balance sheets.

In my personal and useless opinion, I think pure value investing is gone out the window in this ""era"" as sentiment seems to rule everything (as it always seems to do during asset bubbles). So, is *this* the cause of these insane valuations? Is it just hype that's fueling the market?

Is it based on the change in political landscape? New hyper-pro business government leading to less regulation, less oversight, and near full green light to do whatever you want as a business if you're pro-regime? I can definitely see this being the case for TSLA and, if I can assume, the other tech giants are vying for their chance to hop on the same gravy train with Elon as conductor.

Even Meta's run makes no sense to me—especially after their Metaverse blunder and even the AI hype to me seems like a misdirection away from some deeper systemic reason.

1ivol7o_MSFT,MSFT,Is Microsoft’s quantum leap a game changer?,"As a value investor who has been closely following the tech valuation debates, I want to share my thoughts on Microsoft's latest quantum computing announcement and why, despite the seemingly rich multiples, I'm seeing something different in the numbers.

  
Diving deep into Microsoft's financials, I noticed something interesting. The market sees the company trading at 11.6x EV/Revenue and 32.8x P/E, numbers that would make traditional value investors wary. However, my intrinsic value calculations suggest that Microsoft is actually undervalued by 7.9%.  
  
What really got me was comparing Microsoft to its peers:  


* EPV at 35.7% of EV (peer median: 20.7%)
* Net income margin at 36% (peers: 14.6%)
* EPS growth at 22% while maintaining these margins 

These metrics are quite impressive, almost defying conventional wisdom. Then, Microsoft drops the bombshell about Majorana fermions and quantum computing. After 15 years of research (and some drama that would make Netflix writers jealous), they might have cracked something fundamental. But here's where it gets interesting:  
  
The market is pricing Microsoft like a mature tech company (P/FCF of 43.4x, PEG of 3.2x), but with these quantum developments, it's potentially becoming something else entirely. It's like valuing Amazon in 1999 based only on their book sales.  
  
Looking at the DCF value ($379.7B) and considering the quantum computing potential, I'm starting to wonder if we're all looking at the wrong metrics. It's not about current multiples – it's about the optionality in future technologies that could fundamentally reshape computing.

Hello fellow investors,

I’m currently evaluating a $10,000 investment over the next year and am deliberating between NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Given the dynamic nature of the tech industry, I would appreciate your insights on the potential trajectories of these two companies.

NVIDIA (NVDA):

NVIDIA has solidified its position as a leader in AI hardware and chip technology. The company’s GPUs are integral to various applications, from gaming to data centers and autonomous vehicles. Recently, NVIDIA’s market capitalization surpassed Microsoft’s, making it the world’s second-largest company by market cap.  ￼

However, the emergence of competitors like China’s DeepSeek, which has developed a cost-effective AI model, poses potential challenges. DeepSeek’s advancements have raised questions about the sustainability of high capital expenditures by US tech companies on AI.  ￼

Additionally, recent geopolitical developments, such as the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, have led to market volatility. NVIDIA’s stock experienced a decline, which some attribute to these tariffs and the competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek.  ￼

Microsoft (MSFT):

Microsoft continues to be a dominant force in software and cloud computing. The company’s strategic integration of AI across its product suite and its partnership with OpenAI underscore its commitment to innovation. In Q1 2025, Microsoft reported a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue, with the Microsoft Cloud division seeing a 22% surge.  ￼

However, analysts have raised concerns about Microsoft’s reliance on NVIDIA for its AI and cloud computing efforts. As competitors develop custom AI processors, Microsoft’s dependence on third-party hardware could impact its competitive position.  ￼

Considerations:
	•	Growth Potential vs. Stability: NVIDIA offers significant growth potential, especially with the increasing demand for AI applications. However, this comes with higher volatility due to market competition and geopolitical factors. Microsoft provides a more diversified portfolio, potentially offering more stability but with comparatively moderate growth prospects.
	•	Valuation: NVIDIA’s rapid ascent has led to high valuations, which may be susceptible to market corrections. Microsoft’s valuation, while also elevated, is supported by its diverse revenue streams.
	•	Risk Factors: NVIDIA faces risks from emerging competitors and geopolitical tensions affecting its supply chain. Microsoft’s risks include its dependency on external hardware providers and the need to continually innovate in the competitive cloud space.

Given these factors, I’m interested in the community’s perspective. Which company do you believe offers a better investment opportunity over the next year, considering the current market dynamics and potential risks? Your insights and any additional considerations would be greatly appreciated.",2025-02-03,3,27

# Tesla Fourth-Quarter Results Miss Estimates As Automotive Revenue Drops 8%

Tesla’s Q4 results weren’t exactly electric—profits missed estimates, automotive revenue fell 8%, and margins shrank to 6.2%. But none of that mattered once Elon Musk started talking about Tesla’s glorious future. The stock initially dipped, then flipped positive after Musk reassured investors that 2025 will be the year Tesla returns to growth. With plans for a cheaper EV, self-driving tech, and even humanoid robots, Musk essentially told Wall Street: “Ignore the numbers, focus on the dream.”

**Self-Driving Hype and a White House Connection**  
  
Musk is doubling down on AI, telling investors that fully autonomous Teslas will hit the streets this year and that the Cybercab—a driverless taxi—will arrive in 2026. Meanwhile, his growing influence in Washington could shape Tesla’s trajectory. As one of Trump’s key advisors, Musk has a front-row seat to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit his AI and self-driving ambitions. However, Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports could dent Tesla’s bottom line, given its supply chain reliance on both countries.

**Investors Are Betting on the Vision, Not the Numbers**  
  
Despite rising competition and an aging product lineup, Tesla’s market value has soared post-election, driven by optimism around Musk’s political clout. But reality looms: margins are shrinking, demand is softening, and price wars—especially in China—aren’t letting up. Tesla still holds a dominant position in the EV market, but it needs more than hype to maintain its $1.5 trillion valuation.

**2025, Make or Break for Tesla:** Musk insists Tesla will be “ridiculously good” by 2027, but investors won’t wait that long. The next 12 months will be critical, with cheaper EVs expected to revive demand, and self-driving tech facing regulatory and technological hurdles. For now, Tesla remains a high-stakes bet on Musk’s ability to turn grand visions into reality—and avoid getting lost in his own hype.

# Big Tech’s AI Binge: Meta Bets Big, Microsoft Hits a Wall

**Zuckerberg’s AI Ambitions Hype Up Investors**  
  
Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission to make Meta the AI kingpin. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call, he predicted that 2025 would be the year Meta AI reaches a billion people and that its AI engineering agents would rival mid-level software engineers. Despite a weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast, the stock climbed 4.5% after hours as investors rallied behind Zuck’s AI-fueled optimism. Meta’s ad business remains strong, with Q4 revenue beating expectations at $48.4 billion, even as the company prepares to slash 5% of its workforce to “make space for new hires.”

**Microsoft’s AI Boom Faces a Data Center Bottleneck**  
  
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s AI-powered growth is hitting a roadblock—there simply aren’t enough data centers to keep up with demand. While Azure AI services surged 157%, the company warned that cloud growth would remain sluggish until it expands capacity. That cautious outlook sent Microsoft’s stock down 5% in extended trading, despite Q4 revenue of $69.6 billion, slightly ahead of estimates. CFO Amy Hood reassured investors that the bottleneck should ease by the end of the fiscal year, but Wall Street remains skeptical of its $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.

**The DeepSeek Disruption**  
  
Both Meta and Microsoft are plowing billions into AI, but a Chinese startup just threw a wrench into their plans. DeepSeek’s latest AI model claims to rival the best of U.S. tech at a fraction of the cost, sparking a $1 trillion market wipeout earlier this week. While Meta was spared from the carnage, analysts are questioning whether its $65 billion AI spending spree is visionary or just bloated. Microsoft, already struggling to monetize its AI push, now faces growing pressure to prove that its massive capital outlays will pay off.

**AI Dreams vs. Investor Reality:** Both tech giants are betting their futures on AI, but execution is everything. Meta is using AI to supercharge its ad business and roll out new consumer-facing tools, while Microsoft’s AI dominance hinges on fixing its cloud supply crunch. With investors growing impatient for returns, the real question is whether these AI moonshots will turn into sustainable profits—or just expensive hype.

# 

# Fed Hits the Pause Button

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: interest rates aren’t going anywhere—for now. While traders were itching for a March rate cut, Powell’s message was more “let’s wait and see” than “get ready for liftoff.” The Fed wants proof inflation is truly under control before it starts easing, with Powell repeating (more than once) that policymakers need to see “serial readings” of cooling prices. Translation? The Fed isn’t convinced yet, and rate cuts might not come until June or later.

**Trump vs. Powell: Round Two?**  
  
If you thought Trump and the Fed’s rocky relationship ended in 2020, think again. The former—and now current—president wasted no time slamming Powell on Truth Social, blaming him for past inflation woes and making it clear he wants rates slashed ASAP. Powell, unfazed, reiterated that the Fed’s decisions are driven by data, not presidential tweets.

**Markets Take a Step Back**  
  
Investors weren’t thrilled. Stocks dipped, Treasury yields popped, and futures traders quickly adjusted expectations, pushing back bets on the first rate cut to June instead of March. While Powell didn’t slam the door on cuts this year, he also didn’t give the markets the green light they were hoping for. With inflation still hovering above the Fed’s 2% target and the economy chugging along, Powell isn’t in a rush to make moves.

**Looking Ahead:** The next big test? Inflation data in the coming months. If price pressures keep cooling, the Fed might start cutting sooner. But if Trump’s policies stir up inflationary headaches, Powell could be forced to keep rates higher for longer. Either way, expect more market drama as the Fed and the White House navigate what’s shaping up to be a bumpy economic ride.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Thursday’s data drop is packed with fresh reads on the economy, including jobless claims, pending home sales, and an early look at Q1 GDP. Investors will be watching closely to see if the labor market and housing sector are holding up or showing signs of strain.

On the earnings front, another wave of corporate heavyweights is set to report. Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA), Caterpillar ($CAT), Intel ($INTC), Shell ($SHEL), Altria Group ($MO), Thermo Fisher Scientific ($TMO), Blackstone ($BX), Cigna ($CI), Southwest Airlines ($LUV), and Nokia ($NOK) will all reveal their latest numbers, giving Wall Street plenty to chew on.

# Before Market Open:

* **UPS** is often seen as a pulse check for consumer demand, but lately, that pulse has been weaker than expected. The stock has tumbled over 14% in the past year as revenue growth slowed and profit margins took a hit. Still, investors are banking on a rebound, with automation improvements and a strong holiday shipping season potentially lifting results. Wall Street will be watching whether UPS can deliver on expectations. Consensus: $2.53 EPS, $25.41 billion in revenue. ($UPS)

# After Market Close:

* **Apple** is in damage control mode. Another day, another analyst downgrade— this time from Oppenheimer, citing weak iPhone sales in China. Between a lukewarm Vision Pro launch, skepticism around Apple Intelligence, and Warren Buffett offloading shares, the company is under pressure to prove it still has its magic.

1hx0wjz_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft confirms performance-based job cuts across departments,"Microsoft is cutting a small percentage of jobs across departments, based on performance, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.

“At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email to CNBC on Wednesday. “We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.”

Business Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday.

The job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%.

Microsoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts.

In early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap.

As 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year.

Over the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month.

Meanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.”

Microsoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.

1hdj3ru_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft (MSFT): a balanced look at valuation,"Okay, so I've been digging into Microsoft (MSFT), and the picture is pretty interesting. Here's what I've found:

**Growth is looking strong:** I've run some numbers (a discounted cash flow model), and Microsoft's projected growth is impressive. We're talking about a possible 9.1% jump in free cash flow over the next ten years – that's way better than its recent history and much higher than most other companies in tech. 

https://preview.redd.it/d7rhqu45un6e1.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=84eb0ffbe7afb471158755f1244094954732e7ea

  
**Undervalued:** My analysis suggests MSFT is actually a bit cheaper than it should be right now – maybe around 9.3% undervalued, based on what I think it's really worth. That's a pretty good potential upside if the market catches up.



https://preview.redd.it/k4l6361bun6e1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=15dcc0dc8ffea9144385a54c489046b9e6c9427b

  
**Financials are solid:** Microsoft's balance sheet is healthy, and their profit margins are expected to stay strong (around 42.7%). They're making money, and they're doing it well. Plus, their revenue is projected to explode – we're talking potentially tripling over the next decade.

By revenue size, Microsoft would be the 49th largest economy, ahead of Portugal, and within a year or two its sales should be greater than the economy of Finland.

If we believe the analysts, Microsoft will grow earnings between 13-14% a year for the next five years. At this rate, it will be the 3rd Largest country by market cap just behind the USA and China in just six years.

My cognitive dissonance is that the world GDP is only growing on average at 3% a year. How can a company the size of Portugal continue to grow at 13-14% a year?

Morningstar values MSFT at $490. My blended valuation based on 14% growth for next 5 years and then 9% for another 5 years gives it a fair value of around $400. But perhaps this is too optimistic, a more realistic scenario could be that Microsoft continues to take advantage of cloud computing and AI for the 5 years at 9% growth, followed by a gradual slow-down to 5% and reaches 6 Trillion market cap in the next 10 years.

Since this is my post, i can certainly dream of a couple of future scenarios for Microsoft:

**Scenario #1: MSFT cannot find a good place to allocate capital.**

If buying another company is no longer an option, and as growth slows, i think Microsoft will increase its payout ratio, or simply buy back more shares. Currently it has been raising its dividend by about 10% a year for the last 10 years. And at the current payout ratio of 27% five year average, it has a long run way to raise dividend.

**Scenario #2: Microsoft splits up like GE into three or four companies.**

Maybe Home + Gaming, Business and Apps, and AI + Cloud. These companies will be standalone giants, higher growth rates are possible due to lessen regulatory oversight, less fricitional costs and better partnership with former competitors.

**Bonus Scenario #3**: Microsoft doubles down on General AI, launches its Business Metaverse from its acquisition of Activision. And maybe battles AAPL and NVDA to try to will rule the world.

1gft011_MSFT,MSFT,MSFT covered put spread double hedge,"Hey all, wanted to run by a trade by people smarter than I to make sure my logic checks out.

  
I believe MSFT is going to start ramping up in to the end of the year. I bought a Nov 8 425 call a couple of weeks ago. I have enough cash to execute if my thesis is correct on the surprise growth I believe will be delivered on the earnings tonight.

  
However, if I'm wrong and MSFT pulls a AMD and drops below my 425 call I was thinking of hedging the play doing the following.

  
Sell 440 put for Nov 15th buy two 435 puts. If MSFT tanks below 425. I buy the shares with my cash.

One contract would execute to sell the 100 shares at 435. My other contract is a hedge against the 440 put I wrote, so I would get premium out of that which will help lessen the loss as I would buy back my 440 put contract to not be assigned 100 shares at 440.

  
If I am correct, I would have 2 puts that would essentially expire worthless and not execute if we do in fact run up.

  
Does this play make sense? Am I missing anything glaring that would put me at way too much risk for this play?

  
Thank you!

  Edit. I could even go out a little further on date for put written to capture more premium to cover more premium on puts purchased. 

Update, I decided to only buy a single 435 Put for Nov 15th so I can capture some profit if MSFT moves against me. Figured best not to rush in to this trade before I fully understand if the play makes sense.

Ideally, I'm correct and I will execute my 425 call. If incorrect, well, at least I will have a play for the down side and build more cash for when I finally want to buy shares. Still intererested in hearing opinions on my original setup I was considering for future plays :)

1gf523l_MSFT,MSFT,Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft.

What if she was hired to design the eventual breakup of MSFT like GE.  How do you think MSFT could be spun off ?

I can think of the following categories:
- cloud vs non cloud (doesn’t make sense, since everything is cloud)
- Ai vs non Ai 
- home vs corporate

The motivation for a split, in my opinion, is to unlock the value of this 3T company. It would do much better if it were 2 or 3 companies at 1 - 1.5 T each.

1eg3abt_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft shares drop as cloud miss overshadows better-than-expected revenue,"Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

1dyltw8_MSFT,MSFT,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

1do4yti_MSFT,MSFT,EU charges Microsoft with 'abusive' bundling of Teams and Office ,"The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products.

“The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them.

If the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue.

Microsoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.”

Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday.

The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.

The Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications.

“In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors.

“The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

1dd3guy_MSFT,MSFT,Riding the MSFT Rocket ,"Riding the MSFT Rocket 🚀 

Alright, here’s 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume’s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their “buy” rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it “overweight,” targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a “buy.” 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a “buy,” with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft’s advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsoft’s financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsoft’s robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**There’s been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft’s future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They’ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They’ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft’s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications’ performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure’s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft’s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apple’s Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it’s got people rethinking their game plan. Here’s the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, “Seriously, Apple? That’s it?”
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn’t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren’t having it. Apple’s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say “AI fail.” Wall Street’s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn’t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they’re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple’s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT’s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: I’m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it’s a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: I’m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: I’m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays’ more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: I’ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: I’ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsoft’s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I’ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade. 

Here’s to making smart moves! 🥂

1bhxsya_MSFT,MSFT,First real options trade- MSFT,"I've made two options trades so far, once for Disney that netted me a good percentage, but threw my hat in the ring for the big boys and bought a MSFT call for $1,270.

3/8- bought 4/19 410C for $1270
3/14- new ATH, was up 90% when considering to sell, but thought it would go up further Friday.
3/15- stock tanked, was up 20% after Friday close, thought about my mistakes all weekend
3/18- stock rose and fell in pre-market hours and got scared it was doing to fall again like it did Friday. Sold it at 9:31am for a 15% gain. Within 5 minutes the stock got back up to $419 (would've been at 50% gain)

So I realized how terrible I am in the moment, both of excitement and fear!

Lessons learned:
-If excited with the return, don't tell people, SELL... Then tell people!
     -I called my wife and brother about how well MSFT was doing Thursday afternoon. The excitement that it would keep doing up (greed) got the best of me.
-If fearful of fall, put in trailing stop-loss instead of just sell... Even if I would've done it this morning, it would've gotten me nearly $700, not just $170
     -This step should be done well in advance.

1b6yw07_MSFT,MSFT,AI has become the key to the chip industry recovery: Meta / Microsoft / WiMi develop their AI technology," 

Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued to rise in 2024, adding about $500 billion to its market value in about six weeks. Driven by AI, Nvidia has almost monopolized the AI chip market with an 80% market share, and the H20 chip customized for China has also accepted pre-orders.

The rise of self-generated AI has revealed the infinite possibilities of AI, and it has also spawned the demand for stronger, smarter, and more efficient AI chips. In last year’s wave of generative AI, Nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. Predictably, AI applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants.

**Meta plans to launch a new AI chip, Artemisintelligence**ial intelligence gold rush, the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. To support the artificial intelligence business, Meta (META) plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year, and Meta plans to launch Artemis of AI chips for model reasoning this year, to reduce its reliance on Nvidia chips.

Meta h,as been improving its computing power to meet generative AI products in applications such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as hardware devices such as Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 processors by the end of the year, and with other suppliers, Meta will have 600,000 H100 equivalent computing power.

**AMD / Microsoft makes a full preparation for AI chips**

In addition, US chip giant AMD (AMD) recently raised its 2024 AI processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. AMD CEO Zifeng Su said on the conference call that its AI chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year.

Microsoft (MSFT), which is betting on AI, has also launched its first AI chip, Maia 100, to compete with Nvidia’s GPU and reduce its expensive reliance on Nvidia. Maia 100 Using the 5nm process, the number of transistors reaches 105 billion, which can be used for large language model training and reasoning.

The two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. Both custom chips power Microsoft’s Azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. Nadella said Maia will first support Microsoft’s own AI applications and then to partners and customers.

There is no doubt that demand for AI chips is extremely strong, and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the Nvidia H100. According to the latest forecast from market research firm Gartner, the AI chip market will grow 25.6% from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. Gartner The AI chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027, reaching $119.4 billion.

**WiMi explores the value from the industrial chain**

Definitely, the outlook for AI chip demand is extremely promising. Data shows, as a leading AI vision enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) under the boom of artificial intelligence, currently in semiconductor, algorithm and holographic AR light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength, and has developed its AI chip business, to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business.

At present, the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given WiMi a new role. WiMi based on AI chip is no longer limited to command control, but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis, which requires CPU and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of AI applications. At the same time, with the deepening of the industry, WiMiAI chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. In terms of horizontal development, AI vision is promoted to intelligent home, commercial buildings, intelligent security, intelligent retail, autonomous driving, robots and other broader application scenarios.

No doubt, 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth, and AI, electrification, energy transition, etc., all need a large number of chip support. With its excellent technical strength and market performance, WiMi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology, and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. With the acceleration of the global digital transformation, WiMi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry.

**To sum up**

In the past few years, the global chip industry has been in a downturn, with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. Today, the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market, and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. However, as the competition in the AI chip market intensifies, it will be interesting to see who will emerge from the AI wave, and how this important market will change in the future.",2024-03-05,1,2

1af84b8_MSFT,MSFT,Part 2 - I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Welcome back my fellow regards and degenerates. Hope everyone had a great holiday season and is getting situated in the new year.

Regarding Lumen it has been quite the rollercoaster since we last spoke. My calls and shares almost doubled when the stock neared $2, but have been humbled on the decent back to $1.30. Since then I have had a chance to dive more into their stock news, have discussions with businesses across the industry, and have stumbled on news that impacts just about every tech business on earth regarding bottlenecks to growth. This is going to be a long discussion as always.

In short, I believe Lumen is decreasing their debt and parting out legacy chunks of their business for a behemoth like Microsoft to come in and gobble them up. Why? Because their infrastructure, physical assets, and network can be transitioned into whatever Microsoft needs and writing a $10-$20B check is nothing to a tech giant like them. Every physical Lumen location could be easily transitioned into a point of presence (POP) or an edge facility for any of the numerous SaaS or physical products that Microsofts sells. Lumen (the Level3 side) also owns numerous contract vehicles within the government space, giving Microsoft unique access to Fed contracts they didn't have before.

&#x200B;

This is a pit stop for the tl;dr boys, see you on the other side.

&#x200B;

To get this started I am going to discuss some brief Lumen news, rumors and topics the industry believes, and wrap it up into how I think Lumen is uniquely positioned for the industry strangulation that is about to occur. I will discuss the bottlenecks and provide speculation on how the obstacles will be handled.

First things first Lumen rebranded, again... They're orange now; why? I am not sure but they are. Next Lumen has effectively fired \~15,000 employees without anyone blowing a whistle on such a decline over the past few years. Very impressive Kate, but too bad it didn't work the same with UPS; womp womp.

Lumen recently restructured their debt TSA' allowing them access to $1.325B long term debt, and delaying the strain of $12.5B of their current debt. Freeing up this strangle will allow the business to maneuver much easier without banks putting a damper on everything, but they're not out of the woods yet.

Lumen is going all in on NaaS and Quantum Fiber. They received certifications at the CES 2024 show in Vegas for two WiFi-7 devices (golf clap). This may seem dumb, but this is actually huge for the future growth of WiFi, and they've recently hired Satish Lakshmanan who is a AI wizard and the new Chief Product executive. Satish is likely going to innovate the product suite with AI buzzwords and fire off more redundant staff along the way.

This doesn't look like a company that is consolidating its losses, and preparing to die. The noose around their neck has been loosened by the banks, they're reducing their operating costs, and they're innovating their offerings for future demand; which will be important in our last segment.

Before we get there, lets talk about the rumors on the street.

The bulk of the industry doesn't thinks Lumen can turn this around, and I agree with them to a certain degree. That is why I see a acquisition in the future, this is common in the telecom industry, and has happened numerous times. I don't see why a good thing like acquisitions would suddenly stop, especially since banks are waking up and are starting to spend the cash they've been hoarding during the recent economic down turn. The difference is I see Lumen adapting to their current situation whereas giants like Verizon and AT&T are focusing on the same old.

&#x200B;

Lumen does have something a lot of companies want though, and that is physical fiber and this brings me to my last segment. The bottlenecks that will soon plague the tech space, and will require a huge lift to fix. These bottlenecks cover the entire industry vertical and absolutely will impact your life. How fast is happens is up for debate but I could see it happening as fast as 5 years, but will be a common discussion within 10-20 years.

The bottlenecks are:

1. Regulatory
2. Interconnectivity (Fiber, Copper, Radio, etc.)
3. Datacenters (Power Consumption)
4. Energy Companies (Energy Generation)

I am going to start from the ground up, so energy generation. There is no amount of renewable energy that can sustain human tech in the near future. The only way to generate enough will be nuclear energy. There is no ifs, ands, or buts; nuclear power will be utilized to meet industry needs, and I have already heard numerous telecom, datacenter, and investor executives starting to talk about it.

To put into perspective a current rack at a datacenter is usually outfitted with maybe 5 kW of energy, and upwards of 10-12 kW per rack on a good day (a really good day). A fully functioning AI setup with all the bells and whistles will require closer to 60 kW of energy per rack. A more modest AI rack will pull 30 to 40 kW if they aren't using all the latest and greatest equipment. 

Datacenters are going to have to overhaul all their equipment, and allow more power to get into their racks, this is going to take time and depending on the Datacenter company it will mean make or break for some of them. Personally I think Digital Realty is doing a great job of getting ahead of this, if you are curious about a DC I recommend. However, some hubs like Singapore are getting maxed out due to strict regulation. Physical assets can only expand so far.

This brings us to that pesky interconnectivity we were discussing and this is something the industry is very split on at the moment. Currently there is a lot of interconnectivity between various locations across the globe, and Lumen owns a good chunk of it. Most of the major cities have a hub of sorts, and if you're familiar with the industry you're thinking about Singapore, Tokyo, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles, London, and a handful more of places. 

The issue is these connections are starting to get maxed out. There is a terminology called bursting where they are able to fit more information on a fiber asset than it can handle. In short, we're putting 10 lbs of potatoes in a 5 lb bag. The issue is there is no incentives for building more fiber. Previously the government incentivized fiber buildouts and a lot of the companies were able to do these massive build outs for free. This is not the case anymore, and the cost and time delay for these buildouts are large if you're building undersea cables and traversing the globe. If by some chance you do pull a profit, you are making fractions of pennies per dollar spent, and you're waiting 5+ years to get these cables up and running. Very few companies are building fiber assets today, AT&T I think is the only one I've heard of recently, but its all local city fiber. Eventually the interconnectivity assets will be more valuable since demand will be high and supply will be low, and this will require regulatory restrictions across the whole vertical to be relaxed. 

If not, companies will seize these connections from public use, and control the traffic that is allowed on them. 

Essentially laws and regulations are going to have to be eased up to progress forward. In the Philippines they have ""gray outs"" where the government will shut off the internet momentarily to ease up on traffic congestion. This is not a unique occurrence around the world, but if it ever happens to America; there would be full blown riots. 

I think the traffic congestion will cause political pressure, and the lawmakers will have to alleviate nuclear regulations to provide enough energy for the world. The increase in energy we discussed is just in AI equipment at DC', it doesn't account for the electric car grid, crypto, or any of the other massive energy sucks our community has. Nuclear is the only clear action forward, once those restrictions are removed our DC' will be able to provide ample energy, and this will spur new growth across the globe. 

Companies like Lumen are positioned to make a killing when interconnectivity is once again a profitable business. I still believe a merger is likely in the next few years, and to say it bluntly; I like the stock. 

As always do your own research and make your own decisions on the matter, but due to the changes the company is making, and the industry constraints of the near future. I believe this stock is uniquely positioned to blow tf up due to an acquisition. Of all the large companies able to gobble Lumen up, I think Microsoft would have the most to gain from it's offerings.  


But who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.

let's take a look at what this historical data says about $MSFT's behavior on Friday's.

based on the 'average volume & range report' we can see that $MSFT has an average range of nearly $7 - let's say $6.90 and based on the 'range to ATR by weekday report' we can see that it usually fills 88% of that range. 

if 88% of $6.90 is $6.07, we can estimate that on Friday's MSFT will move roughly $6.07. knowing this can help you build trading strategies that put the odds of success in your favor.

3. Law of large numbers: the bigger companies become the harder they are to double, triple and 10x in price. If Microsoft 10xd they would be worth $27 trillion more than the entire GDP of the United States!  
4. Spread Out Businesses: Microsofts business model consists of: cloud services, office products, windows, Activision blizzard, Linked In, Xbox, Open AI, Bing, Enterprise & devices. All of these industries are VERY competitive and the slight loss of focus can result in another company stealing your market. To maintain dominance in these fields a lot of time, focus and money must be put in, not easy when you’re so spread out.

MSFT is amazing when it comes to giving guidance. They break down their revenue, expenses, and from here we can actually create an income statement.

2) MSFT next quarter income statement: [https://i.postimg.cc/FHHcdsLN/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FHHcdsLN/image.png)

I put a low and a high because MSFT gives us their estimates in ranges. This way you can see the more bullish/conservative numbers. I also this a 12-month EPS calculation here which is just the 4 most recent quarters except I'm using ""forward"" numbers because q1 2024 earnings has not yet happened.

3)MSFT has recently seen very low revenue growth and EPS growth: [https://i.postimg.cc/Y9zqzY5V/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Y9zqzY5V/image.png)

Their last quarter earnings was for their fiscal 2023 Q4. Now we have the full 2023 year of earnings and the growth was very very weak.

4) MSFT forward PE as well as historical PE: [https://i.postimg.cc/Xv0b1Xk0/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv0b1Xk0/image.png)

Forward PE is over 30+ with a weak year of growth. Not the best valuation atm, but we all know the rally has been fueled by AI optimism.

5) Don't forget about the Activision acquisition: [https://i.postimg.cc/DybRVnZf/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/DybRVnZf/image.png)

Plus, I would like to reap the dividend benefits but getting nervous of the stock at $332. Yes, it still has upside potential and I believe in it, but the macro-economic situation seems a bit tipsy. I'm thinking of doing a collar option where I would do the following:

1. Buy 25 MSFT 320P Expiring Jan 24
2. Sell 25 MSFT 370C Expiring Jan 24

This is almost as close to a zero-cost collar and provides me with good downside protection while still giving enough breathing room for the stock to run up another 10-12% while absorbing any shocks from earnings or Fed going crazy again/recession. If the stock runs up like a rocket in the next couple of months, great. I'll exit at $370 and pay taxes. If it stays flat, I continue to get dividends and my options expire worthless. If it dips below $320, I can decide whether to close out my options position and up my cost basis (with the PUT appreciation) or sell MSFT at $320 and pay taxes.

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.",2023-05-15,2228,302

12zeetm_MSFT,MSFT,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.",2023-04-26,3186,594

12xbh3p_MSFT,MSFT,"Microsoft ($MSFT), Meta ($META), and Google ($GOOGL) lead earnings waves."," The stock market rally had another sideways week, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all drifting lower in continued tight action. Investors await a flood of earnings headlined by **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and Google parent **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**). 

 

Buying opportunities haven't been plentiful, and many have fizzled or failed. Earnings season will hit full force in the coming week, offering the potential for the market rally to break out of its rut.

Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google are especially important. Microsoft and, arguably, Amazon stock are actionable now. Google stock is close to a buy point while Facebook parent Meta is pulling back after a massive run.

By themselves, they have a big impact on the major indexes. And their comments about future growth in key markets such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and PCs will have a major influence on the tech sector and beyond.

 

Meanwhile, **First Solar** ($**FSLR**), **Dexcom** ($**DXCM**), **Mobileye** ($**MBLY**), **Boeing** ($**BA**), **ServiceNow** ($**NOW**), **Cloudflare** ($**NET**), **Align Technology** ($**ALGN**), **Fair Issac** ($**FICO**), **Visa** ($**V**) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ($**CMG**) are just some of the notable companies reporting this coming week with stocks in or near buy zones.

MBLY stock in particular has an action-packed week, with its IPO lockup expiration on Monday followed by earnings on Wednesday.

**Bed Bath & Beyond** ($**BBBY**) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday, with the long-ailing housewares retailer struggling with debts and declining sales. BBBY stock has been plunging for a long time, but the meme stock did jump 23% last week despite the prospect of bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, keep an eye out for news on **Shockwave Medical** ($**SWAV**). SWAV stock spiked Friday on a report that **Boston Scientific** ($**BSX**) is mulling a **Shockwave takeover bid**. But the companies haven't said anything.

# Valuation (Discounted Cash Flow)

* **Revenue growth rate:** for the next 5 years will be **10%** decreasing slowly from year 6 to 10 to the **risk-free rate**.
* **Operating Margin:** The operating margin is forecasted to increase from 40.97% in 2022 to **46%** in 2027, as the transition to software revenue increases their operating margins.
* **Cost of Capital:** The company's cost of capital stands at **8.66%**, with 97.17% of it being equity with a cost of 8.83%, and 2.83% being debt with a cost of debt of 2.99%.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** The terminal growth rate is anticipated to be a risk-free rate of **3.30%**.
* **Terminal Cost of Capital:** The terminal cost of capital is calculated as the risk-free rate plus 4.5%, equating to **7.80%**.
* **Terminal Return on Invested Capital:** The terminal return on invested capital is expected to be **13%.**
* **Value per Share**: The value per share is estimated at **$253**.
* **Market Price Today:** The current market price of the company is **$291**.

Based on the above calculations, the company is **overvalued**. The company has a big moat and is incredibly profitable and diversified. This seems the case of buying a great company at a reasonable price situation, but at the current price, I don't think it's a good opportunity to get back on it.

# Benjamin Graham Valuation Model

* Earnings per share in period 0: **$9**
* Growth in EPS in the next 7 to 10 years: **12%**
* Current Yield on AAA Corporate bonds: **4.6%**
* Value of the stock according to the model: **$280.**

# Risks

**Dependence on key products with big market share:**

* Microsoft's financial performance is heavily reliant on a few key products, such as Windows, Office, and to a certain extent Azure. Any decline in the demand for these products could have a negative impact on the company's revenue and especially on its profitability as these products are the ones with bigger profit margins.

**Legal and regulatory risks:**

* Microsoft operates in multiple countries and is subject to a range of laws and regulations that could affect its operations and financial performance, such as antitrust laws, data privacy laws, antimonopolistic measures, and tax regulations.

# TLDR

According to my discounted cash flow model analysis, the market price of Microsoft is overvalued. This is a fantastic business with growing and monopolistic segments, furthermore, this company has almost no debt to speak of, offers a dividend and buybacks, and is really profitable. This is a case of **a great business with great fundamentals and services.**

However, there are several risks to consider, including the dependence on key products and legal and regulatory risks such as GDPR or other anti-monopolistic measures that governments may take. Despite these challenges, Microsoft is exceptional in almost every segment.

Microsoft Corporation develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide. The company operates in three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Microsoft currently trades at a free cash flow yield of 3.55% and pays a dividend yield of 1.13%. In 2022, they paid shareholders roughly $18 billion in dividends and were able to produce roughly $65 billion in free cash flow. Going forward, assuming current free cash flow remains constant, Microsoft can easily cover its current dividend payments and should easily be able to conservatively increase the amount paid to shareholders by 4 to 6%  per year.

On a scale of 1 to 20, Microsoft's average credit rating currently sits at a perfect 20 out of 20 meaning it is extremely unlikely the company will default on its debt.

Microsoft can be classified as a very asset-light business with current return on tangible assets sitting at 34.21% and an average 10-year return on tangible assets of 24.20%.

Microsoft's historical growth profile is as follows:

* 10-Year Average Sales Growth: 11.12%
* 10-Year Average EBITDA Growth: 14.13%
* 10-Year Average Cash From Operations Growth: 13.74%
* 10-Year Average Free Cash Flow Growth: 12.05%

Microsoft's historical growth per share profile is as follows:

* 10-Year Average Sales Per Share Growth: 12.50%
* 10-Year Average EBITDA Per Share Growth: 15.57%
* 10-Year Average Cash From Operations Per Share Growth: 15.20%
* 10-Year Average Free Cash Flow Per Share Growth: 13.50%

Average analyst's sales growth estimates for 2023 & 2024 are as follows:

* High Estimates: 14.34%
* Average Estimate: 10.09%
* Low Estimate: 4.23%

Over the last 10 years, Microsoft repurchased roughly 10% of its shares outstanding as it has taken shares outstanding from a maximum of 8.47 billion down to 7.54 billion today. Microsoft has also decreased debt by roughly 32% over the last 10 years, taking debt from a maximum of $91 billion down to $61 billion, or one year's worth of current free cash flow.

Comparing Microsoft's average 10-year Gross, EBITDA, CFO, and FCF margins to where they sit today, you see that slight margin expansion has occurred in all of the listed margins with EBITDA margin showing the biggest improvement with an average 10-year margin of 41.87% versus a current margin of 49.35%. 

Microsoft currently produces roughly $65 billion in free cash flow or $8.64 per share. If we discount the $8.64 by today's current 10-year treasury rate of 3.88%, we get an estimated value per share of $222.68. If we assume free cash per share grows by 7% in 2023 to $9.24 per share and discount that by the 10-year treasury rate, we have an estimated forward value per share of $238.27.

Microsoft's share price as of writing this currently sits at $239.82.",2023-01-02,51,14

Here’s how the company did:

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.21 vs $1.28 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**YouTube advertising revenue: $7.34 billion vs. $7.52 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Google Cloud revenue: $6.28 billion vs. $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount.**

**Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.21 billion vs $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

Revenue growth slowed to 13% in the quarter from 62% a year earlier, when the company was benefiting from the post-pandemic reopening and consumer spending was on the rise.

Currency fluctuations from a strengthening dollar knocked 3.7 percentage points off revenue growth, CFO Ruth Porat told CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa. Porat said the strength of the dollar will hit next quarter’s results even harder.

Porat also characterized the current outlook as one of “uncertainty in the global economic environment.”

Advertising revenue increased just 12% to $56.3 billion, as marketers reeled in their spending to manage inflationary pressures. The most notable deceleration was in the YouTube division, where sales rose 5% after jumping 84% in the same period a year ago.

Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software maker issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead, despite issuing quarterly results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.

Here’s how the company did:

**Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

**Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

Microsoft turned in the slowest revenue growth since 2020, at 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. The company’s earnings per share fell short of consensus for the first time since 2016, with net income rising 2% to $16.74 billion.

With respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $49.25 billion to $50.25 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue. The middle of the range, at $49.75 billion, implies about 10% revenue growth, reflecting worsening PC sales and slower cloud infrastructure growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected more, at $51.49 billion. The company’s implied gross margin, at 69.85%, was wider than the 69.30% consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.

And for the new 2023 fiscal year, the company reiterated its forecast from three months ago, despite the economic climate.

SO many good choices and only so little dough to send. Anyways…

I keep stumbling into BRKB (obv), BLK, and TROW. 

I love Buffett, but I love dividends. BRKB will likely shine like a diamond until kingdom come- and it may likely be worth a buy where it sits currently- but I’m in love with money for nothing, dividends. 

BLK:

52 wk: $582 - $973. 

Currently seated at $671, down 27% YTD. It is considerably under the 200 day SMA ($815), but this past week it climbed back to end the week basically matched with the 50 day SMA ($673). 

BLK yields 2.86% with a 10yr avg of 2.36%. They’ve gained 62% over the last 5 years, even with the remarkable loss YTD. With a forward PE of 17.3, why aren’t we discussing BLK?  Help me out here if ya would. What am I missing?



TROW:

52 wk: $112 - $224

Currently seated at $125.05, down 36% YTD.  TROW is considerably under both the 200 and 50 day SMAs as well, ($174 & $134 respectively). 

TROW yields a nice 3.78% with a 10-yr avg yield of 3.04%. They are up 75% overall through the past 5 years. With a forward PE of 12.07, why am I hesitant on TROW?


I’m interested in long-term growth/retirement.  I’m in the midst of DCA’ing roughly 200K from garbage mutual funds I recently liquidated (long story). 

I like the ideas of JEPI/JEPQ, but at 33, I think I can make considerable growth before entering into likely-low growth/high dividend CC’s. Is my thinking correct?  Additionally, is there any logic WHATSOEVER in adding JEPI to my portfolio and using the monthly dividend to keep fueling my (35%) VOO and my (35%) SCHD?

Full disclosure: I also have smaller positions in IJR, IJH, PRFZ, and VXUS. 10% of my portfolio will lie within the stocks mentioned in the title. 

I know this is a lot, but I take it seriously and I’m ready to lock-in focus.

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

s8harn_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts,"**Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts**

*Originally posted on my* [blog](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2022/01/19/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-thoughts/)*. Disclosure: I am long Activision Blizzard and Microsoft.*

Big news in the gaming world. Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion (net of cash $68b), or $95 per share . This is the largest gaming industry acquisition ever, which crushed the previous record established last week when Take Two bought Zynga for $11 billion. The deal is also Microsoft’s biggest ever.

Microsoft offered a 45% premium. This is a hefty premium compared to where ATVI traded in recent months, but ATVI traded at higher prices one year ago (52-week high $104). The recent scandals have hurt ATVI.

At the moment, ATVI trades \~$82 per share. This implies that the market is skeptical that the deal will close. There’s an arbitrage opportunity here. If the deal goes through, it offers a 16% upside. ATVI also distributes a small dividend once a year. Let’s discuss this arbitrage opportunity. .

Disclosure: I am long ATVI and Microsoft. I’ve been a shareholder of both companies before the announcement. I’m pleased with the offer. I’m biased. I don’t see the risk the market does and that’s the issue. It’s not the capacity to pay. Microsoft has the cash and won’t dilute shareholders. So it sounds like possible antitrust issues. Is there anything else I’m missing?

Here’s a brief background on both companies:

**Activision Blizzard**

It’s no secret that the company behind blockbuster games like Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo is going through a rough patch, to say the least. I’m not going to rehash everything that happened (years of sexual harassment, discrimination, and misconduct). But what happened and how it was handled is business/PR 101 on what not to do.

ATVI’s reputation is damaged. Talent is leaving. There’s probably more skeletons in the closet. Bobby Kotick built a great company, great games, and rewarded shareholders very well along the way. But Kotick mismanaged the crisis and lost the trust of the gamers, public, employees, and the market. We don’t have the full story. I suspect more internal problems, more culture and development issues with games. And it’s not just the scandal, ATVI has made some missteps in the past.

The thing is the scandal would have followed the company for a long time. These things don’t go away easily. The media and the Internet will keep bringing up. And if you underperform operationally, game quality and growth is affected, the pressure will just keep going up. Your culture might be so tainted that gamers don’t want to be associated with your games. A crisis like that would have taken years to fix and in the process possibly lose your competitiveness and sales. Who knows if the stock would ever recover.

With this background, I understand why ATVI accepted the $95 cash offer. It’s probably better that ATVI is under a different home. Fix the issues away from the public. It’s been reported that Kotick will leave if and once the deal closes. In a sense it gives him a graceful exit.

**Microsoft**

Microsoft has been making a lot of deals lately. WSJ reported that MSFT had long been interested in ATVI and had discussed a potential acquisition in the past.

If you are going to spend $75 billion for a business, you have big plans. It’s also telling of their gaming ambitions. For the last ten years MSFT has been boosting their gaming portfolio.

For the last ten years Microsoft has been boosting their gaming assets. Microsoft has been working on building the “Netflix” of gaming. A subscription based cloud gaming service. Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows people to stream games via nearly any internet-connected device (issue is that game requires a lot of data to run smoothly). And because Microsoft owns Azure, they have the cloud infrastructure to support such a strategy.

The strategy is to persuade gamers to abandon their expensive hardware and play on the cloud. If Microsoft could convert some of Activision’s close to 400 million monthly active users into subscribers, it could significantly bolster its cloud-game business.

**Issues**

I believe it comes down to antitrust. But because I’m set to benefit I don’t fully see the risk the market does. John Hempton from Bronte Capital brought up some of the same issues on a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_Hempton/status/1483540883333324802). But I don’t see anything substantial in the Twitter comments. I share some of his views. Here’s what I think and please let me know what I don’t see:

* Is there a precedent where the Gov/Justice Department/FTC blocked a gaming transaction?
* The deal is not expected to close for a while (ATVI Fiscal 2023) but that is still a big gap.
* I think the #1 factor is Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC. She’s been very vocal about taking on big tech. She’s writing papers about. That’s why she got the job. The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor is not Microsoft’s ally.
* This deal poses an important test of the Biden Administration’s generally unfriendly view of large technology acquisitions.
* However, from a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other big tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google).
* Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t go through. This indicates to me that they are confident the deal will go through.
* The games will need to be on multiple platforms (Playstation, PC, Nintendo, mobile etc…). If not it’s a deal breaker. The deal won’t get approved and you will get a gamer mutiny. And gamers are crazy.
* Keeping the games multi-platform also makes business sense. If you fence off Call of Duty to only Xbox, you will kill part of the gamer community and hurt the branding. If you pay $75b you want to see some returns at the end of the day.
* If these get hairy they might have to sell a couple titles.
* I don’t think there’s too much concentration. In terms of gaming sales (excluding hardware) Microsoft is #4. Tencent, Sony and Apple have more gaming revenues. ATVI is #7. The deal will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company in terms of revenue.

I think the deal will go through. Let’s hear other views and why.

I really like NVDA and I think they have an incredible future ahead of them but I’m very wary of their price at the moment. Buying right now probably won’t matter in 15 years as timing the market usually never works in anyones favor.

Microsoft stands out to me because they have a relatively nice dividend, especially for a tech stock, and I think they’re growing cloud computing, gaming, and software at a very fast rate. I think it’s price right now is pretty fair for the value that they offer but who knows I could be wrong.

I don't really think MSFT is much weaker than $308 so I figured today is pretty much a one-off....mega-tech doesn't need to come down by much.

She says ""At just under 21 times earnings the Russell 1000 appears set to return just 1.7% over the next decade"".

She goes on to say that small cap Russell 2000 should return about 8.8% annualized.

So does this mean that MSFT AAPL and GOOGL and NVDA etc will all return 1.7% for the next decade?

MSFT is now 9.4% of portfolio. Cost basis $211. 

The shares are mostly long so I could trim.

I know most say ""let your winners ride"", but isn't part of a winning long term strategy to sell when at all time highs or at least trim?

A lot of people including Tom Lee think that the first half of 2022 is gonna get ""rough"" and that ""mega caps will lead a 10% correction most likely"".

Doesn't it make sense to trim a little off my mega cap names and buy in lower if we do correct?

I mean AAPL is now at $180+.  It wouldn't be that difficult I would think to sell a few shares now and hold for a few months in cash and but back in at $160 or something correct?

The same could be said for MSFT and maybe even my GOOGL?

I've read about all sorts of strategies for how to find good stocks to trade, but I can't help wondering whether or not it would be relatively simple to day trade certain stocks that are consistent performers. Take MSFT for example, it's been steadily increasing in value year over year. It's had some down days here and there, so you'd still need to pay attention to what's going on in the market, but it almost seems like it would be difficult to not make money trading MSFT. Even if you guessed wrong on a particular day trade of MSFT, you could almost guarantee to make up for it by converting to a swing trade.

I can imagine one response along the lines of, ""Sure, you could make money on MSFT most days, but it changes price so slowly that you're better off looking elsewhere if you want to grow you account at a decent rate.""

I also realize that there's no guarantee that MSFT or any other stock that's been a strong performer will continue to do so, but as long as you are managing your risk appropriately, that doesn't seem to be a big concern.

oyliq9_MSFT,MSFT,MSFT or BRK.B...which do you prefer...or neither,"Part of my strategy is to build 100 share lots in both tech and brk.b and sell covered calls on them.

But I'm not sure about TECHright now. TECH seems played out per buffett's ways of evaluation. The very near-and-dirty, MSFT blew-up its ability to return value to its shareholders by blowing up its price-to-book ratio. And I don't see an easy way out of the next few years for MSFT to repair its price-to-book ratio.

While it may seem rational to say ""book value isn't important for Microsoft"", it is....not because book value represents some forward value in relation to price, rather book value represents at what ratio a company can return value to its shareholders.

At a P/B of 15 - MSFT has to earn $15 dollars to return $1 dollar of value to its shareholders.

I think it's likely that MSFT and TECH in general (such as AAPL) will trade sideways and uptrend at index rates for the next few years.

That being said, BRK.B is the stronger stock in the near term and a better buy now.

If I'm right about MSFT's growth being played out.

What are your opinions?",2021-08-05,0,10
oxyafz_MSFT,MSFT,It's probable that MSFT can't return much more value to shareholders,"TL;DR - I used Buffett's formula on MSFT's numbers to arrive at a 10yr price of $912. Which is comparable performance to BRK or GS or MO in the \~13% to 14% annualized return rate.

A substantially diminished return from its past performance of about 30% annualized.

And a quote from Warren Buffett explaining some key parts.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years)

Basically - how much a stock can return to its shareholders is revealed by the price-to-book ratio. Buffett explains just how this works but take him at his word for it.

In a nutshell, if a company earns $1 at a P/B of 1.00 then it can return $1 to its shareholders.

If the P/B is too high, then that company must enlarge buybacks (less than ideal) or dividends (worst option) to return value to its shareholders.

MSFT was well within normal limits of P/B up until this recent run. This recent run has entirely demolished its P/B.

* Historical P/B \~ 3.0
* Current P/B \~ 15+

What this means is that MSFT cannot possibly return value to its shareholders like it used to. The value now exists solely in the price it is currently at. And MSFT doesn't appear to have a way to dig out of this hole.

Its revenue per employee is declining, not increasing, and its future growth rate is flat, not increasing therefore not justifying the recent valuation.

To be honest, bravo to whoever made money on the recent MSFT run - but based on the resultant damage to its P/B ratio - I can't say that the return was justified fundamentally.

Plenty of other stocks including Buffetts and MSFT before the last 2 years returned great value to their shareholders without blowing-up their P/B.

When the P/B is high there's only one place to go...down - or sideways while bleeding off excess cash in stock buybacks or dividends.",2021-08-04,0,31

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I’m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-07-25,43,24

nhu2kb_AAPL,AAPL,Why are so many people recommending AAPL and MSFT?,"I see a lot of dividend investors recommend Apple and Microsoft for the sake of future dividend growth.

&#x200B;

Currently Apple pays a 0.70% dividend yield at the share price of $127.

And Microsoft pays a 0.91% dividend yield at the share price of $247.

&#x200B;

For Apple that's a \~27% dividend payout ratio based on the trailing 12 months.

And for Microsoft that's a \~39% dividend payout ratio based on the trailing 12 months.

&#x200B;

Apple has been increasing their dividends consecutively for 8 years now.

and Microsoft has been increasing their dividend consecutively for 11 years now.

&#x200B;

Correct me if i'm wrong but, if i'm not misunderstanding this then if you buy shares now at the current share price and with the current yield, and they both continue to increase their dividends then doesn't that mean that your ''personal'' dividend yield will be a lot higher then 0.70% or 0.91%?

&#x200B;

I mean that the price you paid for it per share ($127 and $247) will likely be a lot lower then the price other investors will have to pay for it in the future but you still get the same dividend per share.

I think this is called ''Yield On Cost'' but i'm not sure.

And if this is true then doesn't it mean that long-term (like 20+ years in the future) it's probably better to buy stocks that have a low yield now but are continuously increasing their dividends and have a lot of room for that dividend to grow?

&#x200B;

If the question above is true then, the point i'm trying to get to is why Apple and Microsoft in particular?

Hello Value Investors!

The first thought that comes to many people's minds when they think of value investing is investing in beat-up, down-trending companies in hope for a turnaround, or companies that are ""cheap"" such as those with a low P/E ratio, but this actually isn't the case much of the time. As quoted by Charlie Munger, value investing is just purchasing shares in a company that is trading below its intrinsic value.

In the linked video, I provide my qualitative and quantitative analysis over Microsoft, using the discounted cash flow (DCF) model and future earnings multiple approach to determine what I consider to be a fair value for the company.

myes6c_MSFT,MSFT,MSFT Earnings Play: Diagonal Spread,"Thinking about a diagonal spread (PMCC) going into earnings. Looking at the past, it seems that the expected move for Microsoft around earnings has almost always been overestimated. I have stayed away from options during earnings in the past cause I felt I still had a lot to learn about them. Reading up on a diagonal spreads, it seems the setup is particularly important. The tastytrade article on them talks about going deeper ITM for the long dated option so that the near dated option sold has extrinsic value equal to or greater than the long option. I like the exposure to the upside of this but I fear that I’m ignoring or haven’t explored some of the risks. Any thoughts on this? Am I missing some obvious things here or is a calendar spread a safer alternative? I have a fairly high tolerance for risk but I don’t like losing money on a position that could’ve been prevented or avoided if I had read/learned more about a specific strategy. 

The specifics for the diagonal I am looking at would be buy the 5/14 257.5C and sell either the 4/30 262.5C or the 4/30 265C

mk9aak_MSFT,MSFT,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years","The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

>""Microsoft will deliver to the U.S. Army over 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset.""  
""The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.""  
""A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.""

Thoughts on this news? What do you guys think about some employees opposing the decision? All I know is Microsoft is a monster of a company. Just another reason to continue holding I guess",2021-04-01,3966,292

mbjmdg_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

I did provide chart breakdowns and analysis in the post but cannot post them to this subreddit. If you would like to read the full post including the chart breakdowns you can do so here: [https://maxxprofits.com/p/msft-bullish-sentiment](https://maxxprofits.com/p/msft-bullish-sentiment)

The tech giants really took a hit recently. While a lot of people panicked and sold on the hype of inflation and chip shortages I took this opportunity to buy buy buy. This article is going to focus on one of those buys specifically. Microsoft (MSFT)

Not only do I believe that MSFT is a great stable company but it’s also at a price point that I would consider a value. Some of you reading this might think…Wait a second, how can a company be a value buy when it’s sitting near all time high’s? When I say value I don’t mean the Graham-Buffett type of value investing. With this market those types of buys are rare because everything has gone up, up and away. What I’m looking for is companies that I feel strongly bullish on for many years to come aligning with certain technical indicators on the chart. Let’s dive into the meat and potatoes of why I feel MSFT is a great buy.

{Chart Breakdown}

As you can see MSFT recently peaked at all time high’s of $246.13 on February 16, 2021. After divvies were paid we see it trickle down to the 50EMA and slightly bounce up until we hit the market correction that arrived in early March. On this chart the blue line is the 50EMA and the pink line is the 200EMA. I use these two points for various reasons but just know that the 50EMA(blue) acts sort of like a support line. We can see it trickle down a little bit below it but the last time it saw more than two weeks under the 50EMA was March 2020 and we saw it drop below the 200EMA as well for obvious reasons.

{Chart Breakdown}

Crossing below the 50EMA is a bearish sign to a degree. Crossing below the 200EMA is a hard bearish sign that we shouldn’t ignore. Thankfully, MSFT is far off from it’s 200EMA and I don’t see it getting close anytime soon.

**Part A** of my technical analysis focuses on the price bouncing off it’s 50 day moving average. We now know that the market has corrected, the price rejected the support and reversed and unless the market flips it and reverses it we should see some movement up.

**Part B** is where the real magic lays. For anyone who hasn’t traded with me in the past - I live by the MFI. I get questions all the time why I choose MFI over RSI and just know…**MFI don’t lie**.

The MFI stands for Money Flow Index and it shows the money coming in and out. It helps traders identify overbought and oversold levels. The MFI starts getting overbought when it crosses above 60. I personally don’t really consider it truly overbought until we cross above 80. Oversold levels are 20s and below.

{Chart Breakdown}

This is a zoomed out daily chart of MSFT going back to summer of 2017. The MFI only crossed below 30 twice in the past 3.5 years. October 10, 2018 and March 04, 2021. 

MSFT had some ups and downs in 2018 and people didn’t like that so it sold off. It didn’t really start recovering until late December of that same year and that recovery didn’t stop until our friend COVID arrived:

{Chart Breakdown}

Now, with the price dropping significantly one would think the MFI would immediately go into extreme oversold conditions….but it didn’t. The price of MSFT dropped from 190 to 131 in such a rapid short time but our MFI held strong at 31. Since then the MFI has dropped down to 31-32 on two other occasions and quickly reversed:

{Chart Breakdown}

Each of these reversals saw a +10%-15% price increase fairly quickly. In the times of roaring GME gains I understand that 10-15% seems like weak sauce but to us investing vets thats a solid ass play. What makes this play even better is that bounce off the 50EMA. In my personal opinion with the combination of the MFI being so low we are about to see MSFT soar past it’s all time high and fly with the eagles in the cloud.

ixpi4d_MSFT,MSFT,"Video explaining the huge growth of large cap growth stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOGL)","I've seen this question everywhere on this sub: ""why did apple/tesla/[insert large growth company name here] growth so much so quick! They still haven't made a lot of profit! We are in a bubble!""

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

https://youtu.be/foqswJT3Spc

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",2020-09-22,961,358
ixnn9e_MSFT,MSFT,Microsoft’s Bethesda deal is a $7.5 billion part of its plan to crush Sony,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-bethesda-deal-plan-to-crush-sony-192035782.html

To say that Microsoft’s latest acquisition is a coup for the gaming powerhouse is an understatement. It not only adds 8 new studios to the company’s empire, bringing the total to 23, but, more importantly, ensures that ZeniMax’s titles will appear on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service the same day they hit the market. Titles from third-party developers often don’t make it to Game Pass until months after their initial release.

“With over 15 million subscribers currently on its Game Pass MSFT is doubling down on its consumer endeavors with this acquisition, a smart and strategic move in our opinion heading into its highly anticipated new console release,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in an analyst note following the announcement.

It’s important to note that Microsoft lost to Sony in the current console generation. It sold fewer units of its Xbox One than Sony sold of its PlayStation 4, roughly 50 million to 110 million, despite the prior generation’s Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 nearly matching each other in sales.

igqxx0_MSFT,MSFT,"$MSFT - Might Break out Soon, Keep in your Watch List","I was just looking at some charts and found out that MSFT can breakout in the next few days and that would be an excellent entry. Just wanted to share it with everyone here. Let us look at the charts.

# 4 Hour Chart

[4 Hour Chart for MSFT. Resistance at $216.5](https://preview.redd.it/ve42gnckg9j51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ff94ff38c4f0458e7f1eb63faebb2be2531e7f7)

Looking at this chart, this is the third time MSFT is hitting this resistance level. It's also consolidating at this level instead of just running directly to the level. That is usually a much better setup since you have a stop loss right below the consolidation area at around $212. The best entry would be at the breakout (ensure that there is some heavy volume) or on a dip at 216.5 after the breakout.

# 1 Hour Chart

[Similar setup on 1 hour chart as well](https://preview.redd.it/ltge7f72h9j51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2175efcd6150b32dc43dfb31d47988c7663c11e)

Similar setup on 1 hour chart. Right at the resistance. If there is a small pull back on 215 or 214, that's okay as long as there isn't a heavy dip.

Lastly, I checked my own dashboard as well and all of my tools are bullish on MSFT in the next 1-2 weeks. Here is some information about today's options flow + some probabilities for a bullish move in the next few days.

[My Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/dudnfz9kh9j51.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0cee661c8871b8b8db23673d9955c73d9b0c506)

The tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish  means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current       close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock   is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$BABA**  \- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving  average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).

**$CHWY**  \- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if  it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))

**$MSFT** \- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.

**$TWLO**  \- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$SPCE**  \- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a  week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can  break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**  with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it  breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance  level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))

**$SRNE**  \- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool  and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to  follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down  at some time.

**$JPM** \- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))

hwf0j2_MSFT,MSFT,TRADE OF THE DAY: Microsoft ($MSFT) Post-Earnings Looking For Next Movement Using Vertical Spreads Using 28AUG Series [07/23/20],"*Ahoy!*

The NASDAQ high-fliers are extremely overbought and getting sloppy, but markets frequently rise much further than logic would dictate.

[**Microsoft (MSFT) has just reported earnings and is still consolidating within a 15 point range**](https://i.imgur.com/FZsCvFg.png), building up energy for the next movement.

**A break above $214/share would be a long signal**, with the stop being below $201/share. This gap of $13 between the entry price and the stop represents your ""risk,"" which needs to be sized to no more than 1-2% of your account value.

For example, if you traded a ten share position, then your aggregate risk would be $130. This represents a 2% risk position for an $6500 account.

Alternatively, a more efficient way to trade this breakout in a limited-risk fashion is with **MSFT vertical spreads using the 28AUG series**, where you can limit the risk/contract to *no more than $125/contract.*

Be aware of the 8/19 ex-dividend if playing call spreads.

If you are wary of the large drop off following yesterday's earnings report, it's likely due to Azure  expected growth under-performing (+47% vs +55% Est), but there's also a good chance that when cash markets open MSFT goes up anyway.  Even Microsoft subscriptions growth has dropped in half. LinkedIn also, which resulted in layoffs recently.

That said, they are in the right sector at the right time, so these fundamentals are less noteworthy than you might expect.

1) Both are located in Redmond, Washington so ideally it would be easier to work together and merge employees with one another. PLUS Microsoft has hired employees from micro vision in the past
2) Microsoft just landed a HUGE contract with the army to provide hollolens to them.
3) Microsoft has been a long time customer of Microvision for their hollolens 
4) Microsoft’s Xbox assistant “project Osiris” touted in the trailer that it has a state of the art built in projector with wall detection capabilities. Leveraging Microvisions state of the art projector technology.
5) Might want to fact check me on this one but I believe that Apple is using one of Microvisions patents. What better way of sticking it to Apple by having Apple Pay Microsoft through the use of their potentially bought microvision sensors.
6) Xbox could finally maybe revive the Kinect and make it as great as it was supposed to be in the future with this technology.

Though, when you look under the hood and how it is currently priced, I'd have to say that it may be one I'd stay away from.

&#x200B;

I work in the SaaS industry, and I can confidently say that all of our most transformative clients all choose AWS over Azure. Azure is viewed more as a legacy infrastructure, one that configures easily with .NET applications. Almost as if the ""safe"" option rather than one that can transform how a company looks at its infrastructure. The reason I bring this up is because it demonstrates the loyalty factor with Azure vs AWS: people go to AWS because they believe in the vision of being ""best in class"". People go to Azure as a cost efficient, safe bet. 

&#x200B;

Which do you think is stickier?

&#x200B;

And, if you look at $MSFT's history, besides their operating system, they have copied an existing a competitive solution/product and brought it to market to gain market share. (Bing, Zune, Xbox, Surface, Microsoft phone.., etc) This is not a company that prides itself on innovation, but rather a company that won the OS battle early and, arguably through predatory actions, maintained it through the rise of the internet. This caused them to be sticky within the tech scene for years and so have utilized their high margins to stay afloat by copying transformative tech.

&#x200B;

Enough with sentiment, here are the biggest fundamentals that scare me:

PEG: 2.02

PE: 30.17

Dividend Payout Ratio: 39.11% (Way too high for competitive tech industry)

Azure's Market Share: 16% (AWS: 33%)

&#x200B;

(TL;DR) So all in all, you get an objectively overvalued, 2nd rate company that pays out nearly 40% of it's earnings in dividends, which holds it back from fully re-investing into future tech revolutions.

saying that MSFT made a $55B bid for CRM.

To me, the only logical explanations for making such an offer would be illegal kickbacks directed to MSFT officers, and to consider keeping an investment in MSFT, the CEO and the board should explain a case for why fair market value for CRM is substantially higher than $20B, or if it is close to $20B what synergies or advantages it could hope to gain by wasting $35B  in goodwill towards a takeover.

CRM is a wolf of wallstreet play that makes no money, but makes a good story.  It simply has no margins, and spends too much for its sales, and pays its controlling management what little money it does make.

Its not enough for MSFT to say that it would fire all of the CRM leeches, and gain value by controlling costs, because with $35B to spend, it should be able to take all of CRM's customers, or enough of their customers that $20B sounds like an awesome offer to them.

But now I can't help but pay attention to it still. Did Microsoft buy NOK over the non-trading weekend, or was it announced earlier. What will most likely happen to NOK shares now? Thanks guys, I really hope I didn't miss out from pulling out early :)

Edit: Thanks for all the great answers guys, but after seeing NOK going up 30% this morning I realize this is one of those life situations where taking the risk of not pulling out can infact be worth the reward.",2013-09-03,15,10
