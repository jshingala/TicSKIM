# Main Points:

**1. Trading at a significant premium to bitcoin holdings**

**2. Growing Operating Loss**

**3. Under reporting Net loss**

**4. Dubious business model**

# Minor Points:

**1. Previous history of financial shenanigans**

**2. Excessive use of non-GAAP metrics**

**Trading at a significant premium to bitcoin holdings:**

MicroStrategy (Strategy now) is trading with a market cap of approximately $110.8 billion while holding 568,840 bitcoin valued at $59.15 billion. As will be discussed below, they do not make money in their other portions of the business.

**Growing Operating Loss:**

Since 2020, operating losses have continued to grow with no signs of abating.

**Under reporting Net loss:**

Examination of their segmented income statement shows this income tax benefit line is the only reason why their software business was positive. It appears these tax benefits, as they are acquired, are immediately being recorded against net operating losses. Is it correct to use tax benefits against no / insignificant taxable income? From 2021 to 1Q25, when excluding this benefit from income tax line, EPS (Diluted) is overstated by 40% - 128%.

**Dubious business model:**

No money is generated from operations since their grand idea to purchase digital assets. Is it sustainable or prudent to rely on debt offerings and dilution to stay in business? At some point interest on debt and dividends to preferred shares has to be paid. There are 3 ways MicroStrategy can do this. (1) They can use bitcoin holdings as collateral for cash to pay off old debt (new debt paying off old debt). Look for their ""MacroStrategy"" subsidiary in their filings, which Silvergate bank extends loans encumbering bitcoin. (2) Issue more debt and/or offer more stock. (3) Sell bitcoin. Neither of these 3 methods is sustainable. As long as the price of bitcoin stays elevated all is well. Should the price of bitcoin regress, then catastrophe could be on the horizon.

Excerpt from 10-K 24, ""Our short-term liquidity needs include working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, dividend obligations on the Series A Strike Preferred to the extent that we do not pay such dividends in the form of shares of our class A common stock, and contractual obligations due within the next twelve months.  We expect our cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2024, together with cash and cash equivalents generated by our operations, will not be sufficient to satisfy these obligations over the next twelve months.""

**Previous history of financial shenanigans:**

Previously in 2000, MicroStrategy was found guilty of materially overstating revenue through premature recognition. On restatement of fallacious financial reports, the stock dropped significantly. Some of the same people are still around. As recently as May 11, 2023, SEC has been seeking clarification to certain financial reporting matters. 

Excerpt from SEC administrative proceedings. ""On March 20, 2000, MicroStrategy announced that it intended to restate its financial results for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999. MicroStrategy stock, which had recently reached a high of $333 per share, dropped over 60% of its value in one day, dropping from $260 per share to close at $86 per share on March 20, 2000.""

**Excessive use of non-GAAP metrics:**

To rationalize and obfuscate the issues discussed above. Non-GAAP metrics have to be conceived as GAAP measurements might be too odious.

**Comments:**

One thing MicroStrategy is good at is generating Net Operating Loss carryforwards. How these can get used is currently unknown.

A positive note. Bitcoin would have to drop below $14,450 for bitcoin assets to be unable to cover principal payments of current long term debt.

A good question is why would entities choose to be exposed to bitcoin through MSTR? Specifically focusing on Class A common stock, what claims are available on assets should financing options become unobtainable? Buying MSTR Class A common stock is essentially valuing the 568,840 held bitcoin at a price of $194,782 per bitcoin! (Market cap / Bitcoin holdings) 

There is a saying where there is smoke there is fire. Each one of these points on their own isn't much. When examined together, circumstantial evidence should lead to further scrutiny. 

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

If you made it to the end. Thanks for reading!

EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says Tariffs Coming In April Will Probably Be More Lenient Than Reciprocal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/trump-says-tariffs-coming-in-april-will-probably-be-more-lenient-than-reciprocal.html)

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

First off, let’s realize that MSTR has been labeled as a “leveraged BTC play”

I’m here to show you why it is most certainly not.

If we look at its NAV as of today:

Total BTC: 499,096 x ~$86,000 (avg BTC acquisition price)

≈ $42 billion

Now let’s subtract debt and preferred stock

≈ $9 billion in total

Subtracting the debt MSTR has a value of about:

≈ $33 billion

Now let’s take that $33 billion and compare it to its original cost basis on all of its bitcoin purchases thus far:

499,096 BTC at an avg of $66,357

499,096 x 66,357 

… ≈ $33 billion

Now last time I checked, if we spent a total of ~$33 billion on BTC and now have a current value in BTC of about ~33 billion after considering debt… we made a 0% return!

Effectively this strategy has yielded a net of about 0$ at the current price of BTC…

1iirzgp_EA,EA,"Stock Market Today: MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ + Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings","* Markets bounced back Wednesday as investors turned their attention to earnings, shaking off earlier trade war fears. The Dow led with a 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq barely managed to stay in the green. Big Tech struggled after disappointing earnings, but a standout chipmaker (Nvidia) helped lift sentiment.
* Despite the rebound, investors are still treading carefully with trade tensions looming. The focus remains on corporate performance, but any new tariff threats could easily rattle the market again.

# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Mattel** surged 15.33% after crushing earnings estimates, reporting 35 cents per share on revenue of $1.65 billion, well above analyst forecasts. ($MAT)
* **Johnson Controls International** jumped 11.28% after posting a strong quarter and issuing solid fiscal guidance. ($JCI)
* **Super Micro Computer** climbed nearly 8% after announcing full production availability of its AI data center powered by Nvidia’s Blackwell platform. ($SMCI)
* **Electronic Arts** rose more than 7.60% after reporting a strong earnings beat and announcing a $1 billion stock buyback. ($EA)
* **Workday** climbed 6.33% after announcing a workforce reduction of 8.5%, boosting investor confidence. ($WDAY)
* **Novo Nordisk** gained nearly 3.76% after beating fourth-quarter profit expectations, posting net profit of 28.23 billion Danish kroner versus the 26.09 billion projected. ($NVO)
* **Toyota Motor** advanced 4.15% after announcing a new EV-focused company in China, despite third-quarter operating profit falling short of estimates. ($TM)
* **Nvidia** popped over 5.21% alongside Super Micro Computer after news of the latter's AI data center powered by Nvidia’s platform. ($NVDA)

# What’s down 📉

* **FMC Corporation** plummeted 33.53% after issuing weak first-quarter guidance, projecting earnings of 5 to 15 cents per share versus analyst expectations of 77 cents. ($FMC)
* **Alphabet** sank 7.29% after missing fourth-quarter revenue expectations and announcing plans to invest $75 billion in AI, more than the anticipated $58.84 billion. ($GOOGL)
* **Uber** dropped 7.56% after missing earnings expectations and providing soft guidance for gross bookings in the first quarter. ($UBER)
* **Advanced Micro Devices** tumbled 6.27% after reporting disappointing data center segment results, despite an overall earnings beat. ($AMD)
* **Match Group** slid 7.92% after issuing weak first-quarter revenue guidance and announcing a new CEO. ($MTCH)
* **PDD Holdings** pulled back over 3.43% following uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Postal Service’s temporary suspension of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong. ($PDD)
* **Chipotle Mexican Grill** declined 2.56% despite an earnings beat, as its same-store sales growth forecast disappointed investors. ($CMG)

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Market Movements

* ❌ **Nissan to Reject Honda Merger Terms**: Nissan is set to turn down Honda’s proposed merger, which would have made it a subsidiary rather than an equal partner in a holding company. Nissan shares tumbled 4.9% on the news, while Honda’s stock surged 8.2%. ($HMC)
* 📉 **Temu Shifts to U.S. Warehouses After Tax Loophole Closure**: Temu is prioritizing products from U.S. warehouses in its app after President Trump revoked the de minimis trade exemption, which had allowed duty-free imports under $800. The move helps Temu speed up delivery while reducing its reliance on direct Chinese shipments. ($PDD)
* 🏢 **Walmart Buys Pennsylvania Mall for $34M**: Walmart has acquired the Monroeville Mall in Pennsylvania in an all-cash deal worth $34 million. The retailer, working with Cypress Equities, is expected to redevelop the property for retail, entertainment, and housing purposes. ($WMT)🚗 **Ford Beats Q4 Estimates but Warns of a Tough Year Ahead**: Ford surpassed Wall Street’s expectations for Q4, reporting $10.2 billion in adjusted EBIT and $5.9 billion in net income. However, the company issued cautious 2025 guidance, citing market headwinds, cost reductions, and weaker demand in the first half of the year. ($F)🛑 **Google Ends Diversity Goals, Citing Federal Compliance**: Google is eliminating its diversity hiring and promotion targets, citing new federal contractor rules and recent executive orders. The decision follows similar moves by Meta, Amazon, and Walmart as corporate DEI policies face increased scrutiny. ($GOOGL)
* 📉 **China's Apple Probe Weighs on Shares**: Apple shares fell 2.7% premarket following reports that Chinese regulators are considering an investigation into the company’s App Store fees and restrictions on third-party payments.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market. But ongoing claims, which track those still looking for work, have been creeping up, and economists are watching closely for any cracks in hiring trends.

On the earnings front, it’s a packed day with updates from Eli Lilly ($LLY), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY), AstraZeneca ($AZN), Kellanova ($K), Yum Brands ($YUM), Cloudflare ($NET), Roblox ($RBLX), Under Armour ($UA), Pinterest ($PINS), Affirm ($AFRM), Honeywell ($HON), Peloton ($PTON), Hershey ($HSY), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), and Skechers ($SKX).

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** has mastered the art of blending gaming and social media, making it a favorite among the middle school elite. The platform has nailed monetization while keeping safety a priority, fueling a stock surge over the past year. But with its valuation climbing, some investors may hesitate—though Wall Street sees plenty of room for growth if it continues dominating the digital playground. Consensus: -$0.45 EPS, $1.37 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Amazon** faces challenges from all angles—AI could shake up its cloud empire, and tariffs might dent its e-commerce machine. But size matters, and Amazon’s scale gives it a serious edge. With a booming ad business, top-tier margins, and industry-leading efficiency, it’s no surprise that nearly every analyst calls it a buy. Consensus: $1.49 EPS, $187.25 billion in revenue.

1iis4qs_NET,NET,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

1iis4qs_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market. But ongoing claims, which track those still looking for work, have been creeping up, and economists are watching closely for any cracks in hiring trends.

1iis4qs_MSTR,MSTR,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

In terms of 'RSI', MACD line, etc. I did explore it to kinda predict NVDA stock, but it was all a bust. I don't know if it is worth pursing it big time.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market. But ongoing claims, which track those still looking for work, have been creeping up, and economists are watching closely for any cracks in hiring trends.

On the earnings front, it’s a packed day with updates from Eli Lilly ($LLY), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY), AstraZeneca ($AZN), Kellanova ($K), Yum Brands ($YUM), Cloudflare ($NET), Roblox ($RBLX), Under Armour ($UA), Pinterest ($PINS), Affirm ($AFRM), Honeywell ($HON), Peloton ($PTON), Hershey ($HSY), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), and Skechers ($SKX).

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** has mastered the art of blending gaming and social media, making it a favorite among the middle school elite. The platform has nailed monetization while keeping safety a priority, fueling a stock surge over the past year. But with its valuation climbing, some investors may hesitate—though Wall Street sees plenty of room for growth if it continues dominating the digital playground. Consensus: -$0.45 EPS, $1.37 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Amazon** faces challenges from all angles—AI could shake up its cloud empire, and tariffs might dent its e-commerce machine. But size matters, and Amazon’s scale gives it a serious edge. With a booming ad business, top-tier margins, and industry-leading efficiency, it’s no surprise that nearly every analyst calls it a buy. Consensus: $1.49 EPS, $187.25 billion in revenue.

1iis4qs_F,F,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

In terms of 'RSI', MACD line, etc. I did explore it to kinda predict NVDA stock, but it was all a bust. I don't know if it is worth pursing it big time.

Taxable brokerage account from 2024 was a long experiment in Dividends. I use a roughly 50/50 strategy of Dividends dynamically balanced against tech and Growth. The monthly dividends would reinvest in themselves if they weren't growing as fast as other funds, or they would reinvest in my higher risk/reward funds if they were.  


I utilize Margin on the higher risk/reward (usually 25% of the equity) and reinvested that back into the dividend portfolio to increase the dividends and help me maintain balance as the Risk/reward funds dipped (Namely, MSTR).

[Over the next 12 months, these dividends will increase to hopefully bring me to a place where ultimately I can retire early.](https://preview.redd.it/z4slx57z39fe1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=e937ac6e01c0caab568ce0a7f6f8ccd250dbd985)

[These are all of the funds in the portfolio and my cost basis per share. Note that AAPL and ASML are the only funds I hold with a lower yield on cost than the actual Yield.

I like M1 because it shows me an overview of all my dividend stocks. I pruned out most of my Yieldmax stuff. I do use MSTY moderately in my Roth, but not anymore in my brokerage.

1i6mlx0_QQQ,QQQ,MicroStrategy Buys $1.1 Billion of Bitcoin Before Share Vote (today),"Published January 21, 2025 at 5:07 AM PST

MicroStrategy Inc. bought $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, as the company gears up for a shareholder vote on a 30 times increase its authorized Class A shares.

This marks the 11th consecutive week of token purchases for the enterprise software company turned leveraged Bitcoin proxy. Co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor has been ramping up purchases of the original cryptocurrency, with the Tysons Corner, Virgina-based firm now owning over 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist.

MicroStrategy purchased 11,000 Bitcoin tokens at an average price of approximately $101,191 from Jan. 13 through Jan. 20, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It owns about $47.9 billion of Bitcoin.

The company has been funding Bitcoin purchases through at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. MicroStrategy plans to raise $42 billion of capital with these offerings through 2027.

Hedge funds have been driving some of the demand as they seek out MicroStrategy for convertible arbitrage strategies by buying the bonds and selling the shares short, essentially betting on the underlying stock’s volatility.

MicroStrategy has accelerated its capital goals and Bitcoin purchases since the election of crypto skeptic turned industry supporter President Donald Trump, whose administration is expected to have a more friendly regulatory environment for crypto. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Saylor attended the Crypto Ball in Washington, where he met with the president’s incoming cabinet and some of his family members, according to posts on X.

MicroStrategy shareholders will vote on Tuesday on whether to increase the number of authorized shares of its Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion and increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to 1 billion. The amendments are expected to pass, with Saylor holding around 47% of voting power.

The so-called Bitcoin treasury company currently has about $5.42 billion of equity offerings left under its capital plan. Increasing share sales would allow MicroStrategy to continue to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.



MicroStrategy shares closed at $396.50 on Friday, up 37% so far this year.

  
**Thoughts:** Ironically, MSTR buying more BTC REDUCES the premium of their NAV (which was valued at 3x during the frenzy back around Feb and 2x now, leading to less ""froth"" and tying their stock price closer to BTC. This 30x proposed increase in authorized shares will likely lead to more liquidity for their convertible arbitrage strategy, which is essentially buying bonds/selling short the stock hoping for a convergence of NAV premium to as close to 1x as possible. The entire MSTR saga has been the craziest levered bet on BTC I have ever seen.

Hey all,

MicroStrategy just announced they're aiming to raise up to $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings as part of their 21/21 Plan to bolster their financials and buy more Bitcoin. The stock will sit above Class A common stock and could have features like convertibility, cash dividends, and redemption provisions. 

I'm curious, what do you all think about this move? 

Pros: Strengthening the balance sheet and potentially increasing their Bitcoin holdings could be a big win if Bitcoin's price continues to climb. 
Cons: What are the potential pitfalls here? Could this lead to dilution of shareholder value? If the market turns sour, what happens if they can't sell these shares at favorable terms? Also, with perpetual preferreds, there's the risk of perpetual interest payments if not called back, which could strain their finances if Bitcoin doesn't perform as expected.

What are your thoughts on the risks involved? Could this backfire, and how? Let's discuss!",2025-01-03,168,198

I’m not saying crypto is completely worthless but these forward valuations are unhinged from reality.  

A correction is much needed and this firm really feels like a Ponzi Scheme.  I’m curious how much Bitcoin would have to fall to cause this firm to unwind or if this expected dilution they are planning could in turn cause a large sell off.

I can sell 1 CC of MSTR for a premium of $10,000 upfront for a $810 strike.  $10k in my pocket now.

I understand the risks MSTR tanks, or flies past $810 by then.  Both very possible.

I'm looking at this with a shorter term mindset.....

Selling MSTR at $810 for $10,000 plus another 100% stock gain would be awesome.

MSTR is also extremely unpredictable.  In theory, I could buy back the CC on a dump big for say 40-50%, and walk away with 4-5k in profit.

1heifvv_MRNA,MRNA,MicroStrategy secures Nasdaq-100 inclusion after bitcoin-fueled stock surge,"**Dec 13 (Reuters)** \- MicroStrategy ([MSTR](https://www.reuters.com/markets/microstrategy/)) will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer.

The change takes effect before the market opens on **Dec. 23**, Nasdaq announced.

Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) replicating the index's performance buy shares of newly included firms.

Data analytics firm **Palantir Technologies (**[**PLTR**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/palantir-technologies/)**)** and Taser maker **Axon Enterprise (**[**AXON**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/axon-enterprise/)**)** were also added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Meanwhile, **Illumina (**[**ILMN**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/illumina/)**)**, AI server maker **Super Micro Computer (**[**SMCI**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/super-micro-computer/)**)**, and vaccine maker **Moderna (**[**MRNA**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/moderna/)**)** were removed, Nasdaq stated.

MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in Bitcoin, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, bringing its market value to nearly **$94 billion**.

The company started purchasing and holding Bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned, making it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

Analysts have noted that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy has boosted the appeal of its stock, which often aligns with the cryptocurrency's performance.

Bernstein analysts predict that **S&P 500 inclusion** could be on the horizon for MicroStrategy by 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. They also anticipate the company's prospects will improve next year, highlighting ""more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows"" due to the Nasdaq-100 inclusion.

Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by expectations of easing regulatory roadblocks under the upcoming administration. Earlier this month, Bitcoin surpassed **$100,000** for the first time.

""Management has shown no signs of slowing this (Bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying Bitcoin in the $95K-$100K range,"" Bernstein analysts said.

MicroStrategy held approximately **423,650 bitcoins**, purchased for about **$25.6 billion** (average purchase price) as of Dec. 8. The investment is now worth around **$42.43 billion**, based on Bitcoin's recent close, according to Reuters calculations.

**Thoughts:**

Overall pretty interesting article, the Bitcoin premium is roughly around 2.26x to NAV. If there are more serious dislocations (like when we saw greater than 3x and MSTR was trading around $545) the stock could be worth trading again on the short side. More future catalysts for this inbound- article mentions that the company will set sights on S&P Inclusion as well. Other actions the company can take when dislocation gets ridiculous is to do an offering and bring that NAV premium back in-line to something more rational. Worth game-planning for, for future trades.

**Other tangential idea:** Some of MSTR's wallet addresses are known, (not sure if we know all of them, however). The stock likely spikes when they make major buys with their wallet and prior to their announcement of having bought more, because those announcements have spiked up the stock in the past.

1he3s5k_NET,NET,"Is the idea that MicroStrategy (MSTR) provides value to shareholders by issuing debt and equity to buy Bitcoin valid, or is it absurd ?","After adopting the Bitcoin strategy, to their credit, and thanks to the company’s cult-like following, MSTR stock delivered impressive returns (\~600% return over the last year).

However, Michael Saylor (the company’s chairman and former CEO) continues to champion this Bitcoin strategy while dismissing the clear risks that could lead to a catastrophic crash potentially hurting uninformed investors in the process.Here’s how I believe a crash for MSTR could unfold:

1. Bitcoin (eventually) faces a significant or prolonged drop in value.

2. Debt conversion fails: MicroStrategy would be forced to sell Bitcoin at a loss to meet convertible debt obligations, exacerbated by buying Bitcoin at all-time-high prices.

3. Debt holders exercise put options: Other debt holders would demand repayment in cash, creating additional liquidity stress.

4. The cycle accelerates. More Bitcoin sold at a loss → increased pressure on debt repayments → even more selling.Ultimately, this could cause MSTR stock to trade at a significant discount to its net asset value (NAV), further eroding shareholder confidence.

The most obvious trade here is to short the stock while buying Bitcoin as a hedge, effectively betting on MSTR’s Bitcoin NAV premium shrinking from \~3x to 1x or lower. 

However, this strategy comes with challenges: heightened volatility, high short interest (driven by convertible arbitrage strategies from debtors), and the elevated cost of shorting either via stock or options.What is clear.

 however, is that MSTR currently trades at a significant premium to its intrinsic value. While this overvaluation may persist or even widen in the short term, a significant correction seems [inevitable.Open](http://inevitable.Open) to thoughts and pushback!



What do you think of Michael Saylor’s leadership and public positioning of MicroStrategy’s strategy? Is his approach beneficial or reckless ?

Have you purchased MSTR shares? if so, is this a long-term or short-term investment? ",2024-12-14,145,413

1h4yn3z_MSTR,MSTR,Truth behind the MSTR Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy to buy BTC,"A lot of people on here are enticed to enter MSTR because of the juicy premiums and some folks wanted a more detailed explanation of what's going on and how Saylor is raising money paying zero coupons. Having worked in the Institutional fund side for awhile here's a little bit of insight.

What's happening is what is called a ""Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy"" its a handful huh

Here Capital allocators such as hedge funds can trade around this option, which is essentially a very “out of the money” (OTM) option, by taking a “delta neutral” position. In other words, when these arbitrageurs buy the convertible bond, they simultaneously short a certain amount of the company's shares, making them delta neutral.

Lets take this example ...assume that these convertible bonds are issued with a delta of 0.5. To achieve a delta-neutral position, the hedge fund would short $500 worth of MicroStrategy stock for every $1000 worth of convertible bonds owned. As MicroStrategy stock rises and the option is more “in the money” (ITM), the hedge fund sells more MicroStrategy stock to remain delta neutral. When the convertible is well in the money, the delta for these traders typically approaches 1. At this point, the hedge fund is typically long $1000 worth of convertibles and short $1000 worth of MicroStrategy, which basically cancels out to 0.

The opposite is also true because when the stock falls, the hedge funds cover more of their short shares or buy shares to maintain their delta-neutral position. In this sense, these hedge funds are buying low and selling high, trading around the volatility of the stock and simply being long-gamma. This is probably also the reason why the short interest is so high at 14.41%.

We would go so far as to say that these convertible bondholders probably don't care about Bitcoin or where MicroStrategy shares are trading when conducting their arbitrage, as long as there is enough volatility to trade around. Remember that these capital allocators are likely delta neutral but net long gamma.

Reminder that these types of trades are very complicated and have to be continuously rebalanced to remain ""delta neutral"" so they can trade around this volatility... we dont have access to the type of market makers or financial products they have to make this possible.",2024-12-02,71,110

From what I understand, MicroStrategy sells stock volatility to convertible bondholders, who profit from the “Gamma game.” Meanwhile, retail shareholders often see it as a straightforward Bitcoin play, which seems to leave them exposed to significant downside risks, like dilution and price drops.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts:

1. Could this model collapse if Bitcoin’s price or market volatility drops significantly, given its reliance on continuous capital inflows?
2. Do you see this as a clever piece of financial engineering—or is it closer to something riskier, perhaps a pyramid scheme....?

1gzerax_MSTR,MSTR,MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,"Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.

But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.

According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...

1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.
2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.
3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.

With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.

So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.

Does this end poorly? Probably. But for now the music is playing, and we all have to dance.",2024-11-25,841,315

1gyiolm_MSTR,MSTR,MSTR for High Dividends - Are there Potential Blind Spots ?,"I had started paying enormous attention to this ticker since a week. Listened to the full latest earnings call of Michael Saylor where he has nicely articulated how he is looking to create value.

There are a few areas where I’m looking to understand deeper. 

1.	⁠I love MSTY play vs MSTR ticker because it gives me a consistent monthly income, and I would rather have it than trying to maximizing my paper returns by buying the stock directly. From a point YOY view, it is possible that MSTR could go up and come back to the same price where it started a year later. In that scenario, I have made $0 unrealized gains. However with MSTY, I have already earned some dividend income out of it.  Am I thinking this right ?

2.	⁠What would happen if we enter into a crypto winter for a few years unexpectedly, there will be erosion of market price of MSTY. Okay with it. There will be a reduction of dividends. Okay with it. But aside that, would there be any further negative consequences in that scenario ? Can MSTY bleed money in their options play, and the ticker/fund go belly up ?

3.	⁠This is related to MSTR stock. Michael Saylor is issuing convertible notes at a premium with a floor. What happens, if at time of maturity, the MSTR stock price is lower than the convert price, and the bondholders ask for their principal back, how would M Saylor pay the cash back ? Assuming he has already invested in BTC purchase and any BTC he buys, he does not sell. How will he fund paying the principal back ?

4.	⁠During a long crypto winter, will he be able to raise capital during those times ? If he does not, what happens to his BYC yield targets.

5.	⁠Do you expect to see the Implied Volatility of the MSTR stock go significantly down in next 1-3 years ? Ask because that is what I understand is driving the high dividend returns in  MSTY.

I finally understand and realize how MSTR’s stock could grow so quickly if everything goes as planned. Here’s my view of a relatively bullish scenario that could unfold by the end of 2024:

In just the last two weeks, Saylor bought 29K and 52K BTC using stock offerings (ATMs). As the stock price and trading volume are now much higher (2x from last week plus stock price is 50% higher), he’ll likely buy even more BTC weekly.

Let’s assume the premium remains steady, allowing Saylor to keep leveraging it to buy as much BTC as possible. If he continues issuing shares through ATM programs and announces new purchases weekly, and adds debt every two weeks as he’s been doing, the pace could accelerate further.

He might even raise more than the planned $42B since the demand is there. It's insane, how fast they are growing. He said he will get $1.7B debt, then two days later he raised to $2.6B, and after several hours announced $3B. All this happened this week.  
If no one intervenes, he could potentially aim for holding 20% of all BTC—around 4 million coins. But this scenario stops at 1.38M BTC by the EOY 2024.

These numbers feel realistic yet conservative. If things heat up further, this could look even more dramatic. Although the stock trading volume is growing, here the assumption is that it will decrease.

Just two weeks ago, these projections would have seemed completely ridiculous to me. But now, it’s all starting to make sense.

I made a comparison of the top btc-linked equities who own the most btc... a) MSTR, b) MARA, and c) HUT ... i want to preface this by saying *all* BTC-linked equities deserve *some* premia in a bull market. The question is how much & when.

MSTR was trading at $478K per bitcoin yesterday morning... so yesterday's correction was *good* news... it re-rated... to <$400K per bitcoin... i have a feeling the premia is gona expand again though and Saylor will tap the convert markets 3-4x more from now until the Spring. The stock can double from here. Because MSTR's software operations are winding down, it justifies its premia by promising it will be a sort of 'bitcoin bank' in the future. TBD.

MARA was never really known on Wall Street for its HODL, but since the shares were flat as BTC went from $60K to $90K, the HODL now puts it in the top 3 BTC treasury plays. In the past, 80-90% of MARA's market cap was attributable to its operating company: the mining facilities. That has now changed. It's become more & more of a BTC proxy. This is a monumental shift. I didn't believe it 100% until I crunched the numbers, and looked at their latest debt offering... MARA is a top 2 mining/HODL play. It's a new landscape for miners.

HUT was always known as the classic HODL play if you didn't want to touch MSTR... especially as BTC ETFs didn't have any options contracts. If you wanted levered long BTC exposure, you had to either play MSTR or HUT. When MSTR got out of control, traders looked to call options on HUT to get that levered long exposure. HUT is still the biggest HODL play in the mining arena, and due to the recent underperformance, it's also the best value (in terms of cheapest price per BTC). HUT shareholders have also been much less diluted than MARA shareholders, and HUT's float is much tighter than MARA's. Furthermore, HUT's short intrst is double MARA's, creating extra volatility. I suspect the options market on HUT will begin to price this in as HUT shares begin to move again, but nobody knows. They can always sink too. HUT's smaller size has the added benefit of making it a more realistic M&A target (for both corporates and PE), which is always a nice uplift due to the premia often paid to shareholders in a buyout scenario. I like both HUT and MARA at these levels.

# MicroStrategy Tumbles After Citron Research Shorts the Stock

MicroStrategy’s stock nosedived 16% Thursday, courtesy of a scathing call from Andrew Left’s Citron Research. 

The once high-flying software-turned-Bitcoin hoarder got a cold shower as Citron accused it of floating far above Bitcoin fundamentals. The kicker? Citron is still bullish on Bitcoin but says MicroStrategy’s stock has become a clunky detour in a world of sleek Bitcoin ETFs.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin gamble turned MicroStrategy into the unofficial crypto ETF by amassing a jaw-dropping 331,200 bitcoins—worth over $31 billion. But with Bitcoin ETFs now making crypto exposure as simple as shopping on Amazon, investors might wonder if MicroStrategy’s stock is still worth the extra clicks.

# From Darling to Short Target: A Citron Twist

Here’s the irony: Citron used to be one of MicroStrategy’s loudest cheerleaders during its pivot to Bitcoin back in 2020. Fast forward to today, and Citron’s short position is a sharp reality check for Saylor’s strategy. 

Their main gripe? The stock’s value seems more like a speculative joyride than a sustainable business play.

Even with Bitcoin hitting a record $98,000, MicroStrategy’s reliance on hype over fundamentals has some investors tapping the brakes. Thursday’s tumble brought the company’s market cap back down to $89 billion—still hefty but a far cry from its momentary seat among the S&P 500’s big shots.

# Bitcoin Boom, But at What Cost?

Sure, MicroStrategy is still up over 500% this year—thanks, Bitcoin—but that kind of surge has its skeptics. Kerrisdale Capital made a similar call earlier, shorting MicroStrategy while betting long on Bitcoin. 

Their reasoning? You don’t need to ride the Saylor train when Bitcoin ETFs offer first-class seats.

Meanwhile, crypto miners like CleanSpark and Marathon Digital are picking up steam as alternative plays for Bitcoin exposure. And with President-elect Trump eyeing U.S.-only Bitcoin mining, the competition could heat up further.

# Comcast Spins Off Cable Networks

Comcast is putting most of its cable networks into their own sandbox, spinning them off into a new publicly traded entity called SpinCo. 

The move allows NBCUniversal to focus on its shinier toys—like streaming, theme parks, and entertainment—while cord-cutting continues to gnaw at the profitability of traditional TV. This strategic reshuffle sets the stage for a more streamlined Comcast, primed to compete in high-growth areas.

# Cable Castaways: What’s In and What’s Out

SpinCo will house networks like USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and Golf Channel, as well as digital properties like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. These assets brought in $7 billion over the past year but are increasingly seen as anchors in a sinking industry. 

Bravo and Peacock, however, are staying put. Why? They’re integral to NBCUniversal’s growth story, with Peacock recently flexing its muscles via Olympics coverage and an 82% revenue surge last quarter.

Leadership for SpinCo is already lined up, with NBCU veteran Mark Lazarus taking the CEO reins and Anand Kini serving as CFO and COO. The new venture is being touted as ""well-capitalized"" and ripe for partnerships—or maybe a few mergers, given the Trump administration's expected M&A-friendly stance.

# A Play for Growth, Not Nostalgia

The spin-off underscores the brutal math of the modern media landscape. Cable TV, while still profitable, lacks growth potential. Comcast’s move mirrors a broader industry shift, as rivals like Disney and Warner Bros. 

Discovery weigh similar strategies but haven’t yet pulled the trigger. Meanwhile, Comcast is all-in on its forward-facing ventures, such as Peacock, which now boasts 29% more paid subscribers and is nearing profitability.

NBCUniversal isn’t just banking on streaming. Its theme park arm is preparing to debut Epic Universe in Orlando, described as the most advanced park yet. Translation: It’s full steam ahead for investments in experiences people can’t stream from their couches.

# The Big Picture: Spin Now, Merge Later?

SpinCo won’t be left to fend for itself indefinitely. Comcast hinted at future acquisitions or partnerships to build scale in a fragmented cable market. With 70 million U.S. households still paying for cable, there’s value in consolidation—even if the long-term trajectory remains bleak.

For Comcast, this isn’t just about cutting loose legacy assets. It’s about unburdening its core business to take bigger swings in streaming and entertainment. As Peacock and Epic Universe gain momentum, the SpinCo experiment will test whether old-school cable can thrive—or merely survive—when left to its own devices.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is wrapping up, with only a few notable reports left to trickle in next week. Tomorrow, though? It’s looking pretty quiet on the corporate front.

Instead, all eyes will be on two economic reports: Services and Manufacturing PMI. The PMI, a monthly pulse check on U.S. businesses, surveys companies about production, inventories, and overall conditions to gauge economic health.

The services sector has been on a roll, hitting 56% last month (anything above 50% signals growth) and marking its best showing since July 2022. Manufacturing? Not so much. With a 46.5% reading, it’s stuck in a seven-month losing streak. While rate cuts could eventually revive the sector, economists are still waiting for the tide to turn.",2024-11-21,1,0

# Comcast Spins Off Cable Networks

Comcast is putting most of its cable networks into their own sandbox, spinning them off into a new publicly traded entity called SpinCo. 

The move allows NBCUniversal to focus on its shinier toys—like streaming, theme parks, and entertainment—while cord-cutting continues to gnaw at the profitability of traditional TV. This strategic reshuffle sets the stage for a more streamlined Comcast, primed to compete in high-growth areas.

# Cable Castaways: What’s In and What’s Out

SpinCo will house networks like USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and Golf Channel, as well as digital properties like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. These assets brought in $7 billion over the past year but are increasingly seen as anchors in a sinking industry. 

Bravo and Peacock, however, are staying put. Why? They’re integral to NBCUniversal’s growth story, with Peacock recently flexing its muscles via Olympics coverage and an 82% revenue surge last quarter.

Leadership for SpinCo is already lined up, with NBCU veteran Mark Lazarus taking the CEO reins and Anand Kini serving as CFO and COO. The new venture is being touted as ""well-capitalized"" and ripe for partnerships—or maybe a few mergers, given the Trump administration's expected M&A-friendly stance.

# A Play for Growth, Not Nostalgia

The spin-off underscores the brutal math of the modern media landscape. Cable TV, while still profitable, lacks growth potential. Comcast’s move mirrors a broader industry shift, as rivals like Disney and Warner Bros. 

Discovery weigh similar strategies but haven’t yet pulled the trigger. Meanwhile, Comcast is all-in on its forward-facing ventures, such as Peacock, which now boasts 29% more paid subscribers and is nearing profitability.

NBCUniversal isn’t just banking on streaming. Its theme park arm is preparing to debut Epic Universe in Orlando, described as the most advanced park yet. Translation: It’s full steam ahead for investments in experiences people can’t stream from their couches.

# The Big Picture: Spin Now, Merge Later?

SpinCo won’t be left to fend for itself indefinitely. Comcast hinted at future acquisitions or partnerships to build scale in a fragmented cable market. With 70 million U.S. households still paying for cable, there’s value in consolidation—even if the long-term trajectory remains bleak.

For Comcast, this isn’t just about cutting loose legacy assets. It’s about unburdening its core business to take bigger swings in streaming and entertainment. As Peacock and Epic Universe gain momentum, the SpinCo experiment will test whether old-school cable can thrive—or merely survive—when left to its own devices.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is wrapping up, with only a few notable reports left to trickle in next week. Tomorrow, though? It’s looking pretty quiet on the corporate front.

Instead, all eyes will be on two economic reports: Services and Manufacturing PMI. The PMI, a monthly pulse check on U.S. businesses, surveys companies about production, inventories, and overall conditions to gauge economic health.

The services sector has been on a roll, hitting 56% last month (anything above 50% signals growth) and marking its best showing since July 2022. Manufacturing? Not so much. With a 46.5% reading, it’s stuck in a seven-month losing streak. While rate cuts could eventually revive the sector, economists are still waiting for the tide to turn.",2024-11-21,1,0

1gvxxx3_MSTR,MSTR,The Microstrategy dual flywheel,"I’ve been digging into what’s driving MicroStrategy’s price appreciation, and wanted to share my understanding. This isn’t investment advice or a recommendation in any direction and just descriptive. 

There are two components to this flywheel. The stock price premium and convertible bonds.


---

**Stock Price Premium**

MicroStrategy leverages its stock price premium (200%+ above its Bitcoin holdings) to grow its Bitcoin per share efficiently:

- 
   Example: Raising $1 billion at a 216% premium results in just $316 million in dilution but adds $1 billion in Bitcoin. Each raise increases Bitcoin per share, further fueling the premium in a self-reinforcing cycle.

- 
   The strategy combines:
   1. Bitcoin price appreciation - assumed 25% annually.  
   2. Bitcoin Yield - efficiently raising capital at a premium, targeting 8% annual growth.  
   3. Leverage - low-interest debt adds further returns.  

-   This could potentially grow $15 billion into $87 billion over five years, but it hinges on sustaining the premium—if it collapses, the strategy breaks.

- 
   Owning 252,000 BTC (more than all public companies combined) positions MicroStrategy as a unique bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin, with future potential in lending or derivatives.

---

**Convertible Bonds**

MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds attract investors by combining bond safety with Bitcoin upside:

- Investors lend money via bonds (e.g., 0.75% interest) with the option to convert to $MSTR shares. This gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth without directly holding it.

- Investor Benefits:  
   - Downside Protection: Fixed interest payments and principal repayment safeguard against Bitcoin volatility.  
   - Upside Potential: If $MSTR stock rises with Bitcoin, bondholders can convert and profit.  
   - Premium Boost: Since $MSTR trades at a premium, conversion offers amplified returns compared to Bitcoin alone.

-  
   An investor buying $1,000 in bonds earns annual interest but can convert to shares if Bitcoin rallies, gaining equity upside with limited risk.

- MSTR announced this week that it will raise $42b to buy Bitcoin in the next 3 months, $21b via equity issuance and $21b via debt.

I've been a long time holder of MSTR to get some exposure to bitcoin. Currently it's trading about 2X of the bitcoin price per share. Here's a rough math:

\- MSTR owns 193,000 bitcoin at the end of last February

\- Current bitcoin value that MSTR own = 193,000 \* $70,000 = $13,510,000,000

\- MSTR has about 17 million shares

\- Value per share = $13,510,000,000 / 17,000,000 = $795

\- Current MSTR price is $1675 which is about 2X of $795

Why would people pay 2X of the underlying asset? They must have a different method of valuation. What do you think? Any thoughts/opinions are welcome. Thank you.",2024-03-15,48,92

According to Yahoo Finance, the current market cap of the $MSTR stock is $8.27B. 

Is the book value of the company only worth $170M?  I think not.

1941aun_MSTR,MSTR,Bitcoin ETF Approvals Are Bad for MicroStrategy,"Microstrategy is an inefficient structure for Bitcoin ownership.  Bitcoin gains are taxed as capital gains and can get long-term capital gains treatment if owned by an individual through an ETF.  MSTR is a C corp and must pay income tax on realized Bitcoin gains.  They must repurchase shares or pay dividends to return that capital to a shareholder.  At the top marginal tax rate, an incremental $1 of bitcoin gains through MSTR is worth $.63 to a shareholder.  Using a Bitcoin ETF in a normal account, an incremental $1 of gains is worth $.80.  In a tax-advantaged account, the gain could be worth up to $.79 through MSTR and $1 in an ETF.  It doesn’t matter if they don’t plan to sell the Bitcoin.  The government has a claim on the gains; Bitcoin with an unrealized gain through a C corp will always be worth less to an investor.

Some claim MSTR is a profitable software company that can plow its earnings back into more Bitcoin, which is valuable.  While there might be a benefit here, one doesn’t need to consider it.  On an LTM basis, MSTR has not generated operating cash flows in excess of stock compensation for 7 quarters.  LTM operating cash has been negative for three quarters, even with stock compensation.  MSTR can currently only use equity offerings and debt issuance to add more coins.

|LTM Op CF ($M)|24.7|3.2|(3.1)|(0.7)|(6.7)|

In light ETF approvals, MSTR has lost its luster.  It used to be a quirky vehicle through which one could get BTC exposure in public markets.  Now, it has all the tax disadvantages of a C-corp and the liquidity issues of the Grayscale Trust.  There are better ways to get Bitcoin exposure now; MSTR’s experiment is obsolete.

MSTR is also less liquid than an ETF.  ETFs have authorized participants that use arbitrage to ensure the market price reflects the value of the underlying assets.  MSTR cannot do this efficiently.  If shares were to fall below NAV, the best method of establishing price/value parity would be repurchasing shares.  As previously mentioned, MSTR’s software business does not generate sufficient cash flows to do this.  They would need to sell assets, potentially realizing gains.

I believe that BTC as a commodity will benefit vastly from the current industry shakedown and I'm investing accordingly.

My current strategy invests based on the idea of a 'bitcoin cycle'. For the first three years of a bitcoin cycle (2022-2025), invest 20% into Nasdaq and 80% into a variety of crypto focused assets with big BTC exposure like MicroStrategy, Coinbase, etc. In the 4th year of the bitcoin cycle, I'll switch the automated strategy to an 80% stock and a 20% crypto focus.",2023-08-01,27,13

At the Benzinga Global Small Cap  Conference Friday,  Benzinga cryptocurrency editor Catherine Ross hosted  a panel discussion  on how digital currencies are disrupting finance  and providing  opportunities for innovation in payments, privacy and  efficiency.

The panel discussion included Geoff Morphy, president of **Bitfarms Ltd** (OTC:BFARF), Charles Allen, CEO of **BTCS Inc** (OTCQB:[BTCS](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BTCS#OTCQB)), Richard Byworth, CEO of **Diginex Ltd** (NASDAQ:EQOS) and Sheldon Bennett, CEO of **Dmg Blockchain Solutions Inc** (OTCQB:DMGGF).

**Adding Crypto To The Balance Sheet:** Allen said more companies are beginning to add cryptocurrencies to the balance sheet, including high-profile names like **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA), **Square Inc** (NYSE:SQ) and **MicroStrategy Incorporated** (NASDAQ:MSTR).

“It  makes a lot of sense for larger companies to start putting crypto  on  their balance sheets. It’s a nice inflationary hedge,” Allen said.

Accepting crypto as a payment method is more difficult for companies to do, he said. 

Byworth said Diginex helps a lot of international companies add **Bitcoin** (CRYPTO: BTC) to their balance sheets. 

“From  the perspective of 'does it make sense?' yeah, we are big  believers of  the inflationary hedge with the very disproportionate  reaction we’ve  seen to the pandemic by central banks, which was in  fairness pretty  much their only option given all the printing that  they’ve done since  2008,” Byworth said.

Up until  2021, Morphy said Bitfarms was in a position in which it had  to sell  almost every Bitcoin it mined just to pay the bills and invest  in  growth.

“In January of this year,  we actually started a Bitcoin retention  program, and we have well over  500 Bitcoin on the balance sheet now,” he  said.

“We’re  big bulls, and when you can mine a Bitcoin for under $10,000  and it’s  currently in the market at between $50,000 and $60,000, what we  enjoy  doing is putting it on the balance sheet and then because that’s   effectively our adjusted EBITDA, we get the compounding feature of not   just having the Bitcoin on our balance sheet from a low cost, but we   basically embed our profit in there as well to compound it.”

**Responding To Elon Musk:** Cryptocurrencies have come under fire this week after **Tesla, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will no longer be accepting  Bitcoin as payment due to its negative impact on the environment.

Bennett said DMG Blockchain uses the cheapest energy available for its mining, which is often renewable.

“Solar  is the cheapest energy, wind is the cheapest energy,  geothermal is the  cheapest. Iceland is a great example of that,” Bennett  said.

“All Bitcoin mining companies are looking for the lowest-cost energy. Any company is.”

When  asked about which cryptos their companies hold and which they  hold in  their personal accounts, the consensus among the executives is  that  they are bullish on Bitcoin and **Ethereum** (CRYPTO: ETH).

None of the panel members said their companies hold shares of **Dogecoin** (CRYPTO: DOGE) or other meme-inspired cryptos.

Byworth said Diginex helps a lot of international companies add **Bitcoin** (CRYPTO: BTC) to their balance sheets. 

“From  the perspective of 'does it make sense?' yeah, we are big  believers of  the inflationary hedge with the very disproportionate  reaction we’ve  seen to the pandemic by central banks, which was in  fairness pretty  much their only option given all the printing that  they’ve done since  2008,” Byworth said.

Up until  2021, Morphy said Bitfarms was in a position in which it had  to sell  almost every Bitcoin it mined just to pay the bills and invest  in  growth.

“In January of this year,  we actually started a Bitcoin retention  program, and we have well over  500 Bitcoin on the balance sheet now,” he  said.

“We’re  big bulls, and when you can mine a Bitcoin for under $10,000  and it’s  currently in the market at between $50,000 and $60,000, what we  enjoy  doing is putting it on the balance sheet and then because that’s   effectively our adjusted EBITDA, we get the compounding feature of not   just having the Bitcoin on our balance sheet from a low cost, but we   basically embed our profit in there as well to compound it.”

**Responding To Elon Musk:** Cryptocurrencies have come under fire this week after **Tesla, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will no longer be accepting  Bitcoin as payment due to its negative impact on the environment.

Bennett said DMG Blockchain uses the cheapest energy available for its mining, which is often renewable.

“Solar  is the cheapest energy, wind is the cheapest energy,  geothermal is the  cheapest. Iceland is a great example of that,” Bennett  said.

“All Bitcoin mining companies are looking for the lowest-cost energy. Any company is.”

When  asked about which cryptos their companies hold and which they  hold in  their personal accounts, the consensus among the executives is  that  they are bullish on Bitcoin and **Ethereum** (CRYPTO: ETH).

None of the panel members said their companies hold shares of **Dogecoin** (CRYPTO: DOGE) or other meme-inspired cryptos.

mwf7m1_MSTR,MSTR,MicroStrategy stock is an intelligent trailing stop-loss on BTC,"MSTR DD. Not Advice. Originally posted in r/stocks but they told me to come here :p

As many know (but few talk about) Michael Saylor, CEO of business analytics firm MicroStrategy ($MSTR), **privately** bought over $250 million in bitcoin with his own money **before** he started using the **public** company’s money to buy bitcoin...Historically he claimed Bitcoin was doomed to fail until one day he realized that he could **legally** put a bunch of his **personal** wealth into Bitcoin, and then convince his company (of which he owns \~23%) that it should use treasury funds to buy bitcoin, thereby pumping up the price. Now, he just has to go to all his executive friends with controlling interests in other companies and convince them to do the same thing (i.e. use personal funds to buy BTC, then use their companies funds), thereby sending the price higher until there are no more companies who do not own bitcoin. He has already convinced Elon to use Tesla treasury funds to buy $1.5 billion BTC (although, I am unaware of Elon using personal assets to buy BTC). 

Why does this make MSTR the buy of a lifetime?

When other executives wise up to this scheme to simultaneously multiply their personal wealth **and** potentially the wealth of their companies, Bitcoin holders, and more specifically MicroStrategy, will share in that multiplication. Eventually when there are no more companies willing to buy into BTC, Saylor's army of data scientist and blockchain experts will hopefully have warned MSTR that it is time to sell before the masses begin to sell. MicroStrategy will begin to sell behind the scenes and then disclose the sale **after** they have already sold. Meaning that after they’re done selling, I personally think it will mark the beginning of the decline (although it may not tank immediately). Saylor will not sell until he feels he can no longer convince anyone else to buy significant amounts. I believe it will be a more gradual decline as the price will be temporarily sustained by retail investors - which is why I prefer MicroStrategy stock to BTC itself. **MicroStrategy is an intelligent trailing stop-loss on a BTC bubble**. If we assume the price of BTC drops after MicroStrategy sells it’s 70k+ hoard, the $MSTR share price will remain intact - because they now have fiat currency and are no longer valued by the price of BTC. Yes, there are other ways to invest in BTC such as Grayscale… but Grayscale will not sell at the peak, because its an ETF. You could buy BTC itself, but then when MSTR unloads its BTC haul, you risk missing the peak as an uneducated small fish. 

While to many this may seem like a pyramid scheme (it basically is), it is not a typical pyramid scheme. In a typical pyramid scheme, each person only benefits when the next person buys into it. In the case of BTC, each person can play the role of **both the initial investor as well as the next investor;** at the same time, the initial investor (personal money) won’t necessarily suffer the losses of the next investor (corporate money), should the next investor be the final investor.

It is really a rare scenario where everyone can multiply their personal wealth without taking on any significant personal risk. Sure, if an executive is the last one to the party, he/she won’t really see that much gain, but as they’ll be doing a second buy with company money, it’s unlikely that they will lose money – assuming the price only goes up when the next person/company buys. All things equal, if an executive buys BTC with the expectation that his/her company will buy BTC with treasury funds, one of two things can happen:

\#1 they are successful in convincing the company to buy BTC, bringing the price up. 

\#2 They fail at convincing their company to buy BTC, which means the price stays where it is – UNTIL the next team of executives decides to invest their own money into BTC (price goes up) and their company’s money (price goes up more).

Tell me about $MSTR’s core business.

Although the value of MicroStrategy’s BTC has now eclipsed the value of their core business, their core business is still quite strong. In the past year, they have made significant improvements to their otherwise outdated analytics platform and are just beginning to see the rewards. In terms of product quality and feature set, their 2021 platform is a close third to Tableau ($CRM) and Power BI ($MSFT). They have beaten expectations in the past few quarters and have seen increasing revenues. They are coming out of a period of deep investment in their product and sales efforts which are beginning to pay off.

What are the risks?

Because of the strength and relative size of the core business, the biggest risk is that the price of BTC could drop on it’s own, before MSTR is able to sell… However, I find this unlikely. It would take quite a lot of selling at this point to drop the price significantly, and treasuries typically move quite slow. In other words, Tesla does not have a guy sitting around waiting to sell $1.5 billion of BTC if it drops 10% today. Treasury funds usually require a lot of discussion before any moves are made, including sales. They’re much more likely to sell because they need money for operations rather than selling because they’re scared. Because of this, I think the price of BTC will become much more stable than it has been in the past.

ldb5j8_MSTR,MSTR,Microstrategy -- MSTR," 

MSTR has 2 assets: (1) its Bitcoin holdings and (2) its core software business.

Investors are excited about MSTR's Bitcoin holdings -- currently it holds 71,079 BTC, what at $38K/BTC is valued at $2.7 billion.

MSTR""s cost on the BTC purchases is $16,109/BTC, or $1.145 billion. Hence, it is sitting on a gain of $1.55 billion, which it will have to pay taxes on. Assuming a 30% tax rate, the after-tax value of MSTR's BTC holdings is $2.2 billion.

MSTR's fully diluted share count (Class A shares + Class B share + Convertible shares + Management options) is 12.4 million shares. At a current price of $800, that's $9.9 billion of equity market value.

The market is now saying that MSTR""s core software business is worth $7.7 billion. In FY 2020m this business did $480.7 million of revenues, and Q4 2020 revenues were down 2% year-over-year.

Even if we were generous and applied a 5x revenues multiple to the software business, and added the after-tax value of the BTC holdings, the stock would be worth $370 per share, or less than 50% of the current price.

kiplj9_SQ,SQ,MicroStrategy (MSTR) Short Thesis,"**Summary**

* MSTR core business revenue facing sixth straight year of decline.
* Speculating with bitcoin does not solve revenue problems.
* Switched treasury reserve from cash to Bitcoin, making three substantial purchases of bitcoin over the last four months.
* Recently announced offering of $650 million unsecured convertible senior notes intended to finance purchase of more bitcoin.

**Background**

There are times when companies are overvalued due to promise, potential, predictions, etc. This often makes sense as we often say that you invest on potential, not past. There are also times where companies are overvalued due to hype, and without much promise. MicroStrategy seems to be the latter (NASDAQ:MSTR).

Let me paint a picture for you. You are a global enterprise software company that has been successful for decades, but in the last 5-6 years, you have watched your platform and revenues begin to decline, despite the global market you partake in nearly doubling. Your platform and product has been top in class for over a decade, but your revenues cannot seem to keep up with market growth. You are in a good position in terms of debt to equity, and have a good sized cash position. With roughly $450 million in cash, you have ample opportunity to overhaul your product and do some R&D and attempt to improve your bottom line. What do you do?

**Buying Bitcoin Does Not Make You an Expert at Bitcoin**

MSTR’s management decided that the best plan of action would be to “pivot into the business of Bitcoin''. Yes, a global enterprise software company is now a “bitcoin company”, and they are not employing bitcoin engineers, or mining bitcoin, or anything of that nature, but are simply converting their treasury reserves into highly volatile bitcoin.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael J Saylor said, “MicroStrategy has recognized bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy”.

For everyone out there who thinks that bitcoin is a great treasury reserve, and loves this move, we understand that there are definitely arguments that can be made for and against this move, but one of the first questions we asked was, \~“did MSTR management just wake up one day back in August and decide that they were qualified to speculate in bitcoin with virtually their entire cash balance and do they have any idea what they are doing?”.

Our thesis is NO, they do not know what they are doing and here are a few reasons we think MSTR is overvalued at current prices.

Side Note: MSTR is joined by SQ (NYSE:SQ) and SRI (NYSE:SRI) as companies converting part or all of their treasury reserves to bitcoin over the last several months.

**Current Numbers**

MSTR invested roughly $475 million into bitcoin over three transactions taking place in August, September, and December. Below is how shareholders are currently exposed to this investment. On August 10, the day before their initial purchase, MSTR was trading at a market cap valuation of $1.297 billion. As of December 10, they are now trading at a market cap valuation of $2.59 billion. They went from trading around $122/share to $288 share, a $1.5 billion increase in market cap valuation credited due to an increase in their bitcoin investment value.

Since peaking in 2014, revenue has been declining year over year and with estimates of $474mm and $479mm for FY2020 and FY2021. This trend is not predicted to change.

P/E, P/S, Who Cares? We realize it is not 1986 anymore and that the Price to Earnings Ratio does not carry the clout in today’s market that it once did, but MSTR P/E is currently spiking at 2000, nearly 50x its 5-year average of 34x. In comparison, the US software industry carries an average P/E of 53x while US stocks currently carry a P/E of 19x. MSTR is extremely overvalued based on this number.

The same can be said about their Price to Sales Ratio. The US software industry carries an average P/S 2.72x and prior to their bitcoin purchase, MSTR had a P/S of 2.65x. Today, that has doubled to 5.77x since the first announcement of their initial bitcoin purchase.

**Tender Offer**

In mid September, MSTR executed a modified dutch auction to buyback shares at up to $140/share. They ended up repurchasing 432,313 shares at an aggregate cost of $60 million.

We had to read the following headline several times to believe it.

MicroStrategy Completes $650 Million Offering of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025

First, we want to acknowledge that these terms are friendly towards MicroStrategy. The actual terms of the convertible debt do not bother us. What bothers us is the reason behind the raise.

These notes are convertible to 2.5126 shares of MSTR class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This is a conversion price of approximately $397.99/share, more than a 37% premium to where MSTR last traded.

MSTR, an enterprise software company just took on $650 million in new debt to finance the purchase of more bitcoin. Assuming they use these proceeds exclusively to purchase more bitcoin, MSTR would have roughly $1.3 billion in bitcoin. The current market cap of total bitcoin sits around $350 billion.

At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin.

**Fair Valuation**

Based on the tender offer, the market accepted $140 as a fair valuation of operating assets which included the $456mm in cash.

$475mm of their current assets transitioned to bitcoin which is now worth $791mm, for a gain of $265mm.

Translating to per share, this gain equates to $27.92/share.

So for MSTR stock price to properly account for market’s expectations for their underlying business and actual growth in MSTR’s BTC position, it should be priced at $174.13

The new debt offering further reduces this valuation due to significantly increased leverage risk. These new senior debt holders will be the first in line to get paid from this $650mm investment in new bitcoin and possibly part or all of the existing bitcoin position if bitcoin drops below the purchase price. Equity holders will only see any value from this offering if bitcoin is above the purchase price at maturity.

Could MSTR just be ahead of a new normal? 2017/2018 was the last time bitcoin dominated the headlines and really spiked. The back half of 2020 is seeing a similar trend. What if MSTR is just ahead of the market? What if they actually are some of the smartest people in the room and they are seeing value where others cannot grasp it? What if the predictions of bitcoin reaching $1 million a coin by 2025 come true? We can “what if” this decision all we want, and perhaps MSTR is a future case in a class of 2030 MBA program. “The Smartest Ones on the Street” or “What in the World Were They Thinking”. It is not fair to only mention the “bad things that can happen” regarding MSTR. They truly could be onto something here. If bitcoin continues to thrive and grow, and become a more normalized asset, decreasing historical volatility, etc, then MSTR could be an early adopter of a legitimate future normalized business asset class. Perhaps our 1986, or even 2012 mindset are blocking us from seeing the next generation and revolution of business. Although we do not think this is the case as of yet, it is certainly a possibility.

**Managing Our Position**

We are not short shares of MSTR, but are long several PUTs. Our strikes range from $100 to $330 for the April 2021 expiration. We selected this expiration based on our belief that bitcoin is a cyclical, volatile asset class that will continue to see substantial swings. At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin. We believe the market will realize this and bring the price of MSTR down so that it moves in lock step with the actual value of bitcoin. We have targeted exit points at 20%, 30%, and 50% profit targets based on our belief of MSTR declining to its fair valuation over the next few months as bitcoin investment news fades and people realize the revenue and cash flow issues are real problems moving forward. We also have a soft stop loss of roughly 30% which we believe gives us the time and wiggle room needed for our analysis to come to fruition.

**Conclusion**

MicroStrategy is significantly overvalued based on its current assets and business operations. We feel that you are currently paying upwards of a 75% premium at current price levels and we feel that $174/share is a fair valuation based on revenue growth and true value of their bitcoin investment. This is not an ideal investment to get bitcoin exposure, and MicroStrategy is not an investment firm. We feel that they should be returning cash to investors, not speculating on bitcoin with their treasury reserve. We cannot predict how this experiment will play out, but we can assert what we feel is a fair valuation. Time will tell.

Disclosure: I am/we are short MSTR.

Additional disclosure: We are not short shares of MSTR, however, we have initiated several long PUTS across multiple expirations and strikes.

kiplj9_V,V,MicroStrategy (MSTR) Short Thesis,"**Summary**

* MSTR core business revenue facing sixth straight year of decline.
* Speculating with bitcoin does not solve revenue problems.
* Switched treasury reserve from cash to Bitcoin, making three substantial purchases of bitcoin over the last four months.
* Recently announced offering of $650 million unsecured convertible senior notes intended to finance purchase of more bitcoin.

**Background**

There are times when companies are overvalued due to promise, potential, predictions, etc. This often makes sense as we often say that you invest on potential, not past. There are also times where companies are overvalued due to hype, and without much promise. MicroStrategy seems to be the latter (NASDAQ:MSTR).

Let me paint a picture for you. You are a global enterprise software company that has been successful for decades, but in the last 5-6 years, you have watched your platform and revenues begin to decline, despite the global market you partake in nearly doubling. Your platform and product has been top in class for over a decade, but your revenues cannot seem to keep up with market growth. You are in a good position in terms of debt to equity, and have a good sized cash position. With roughly $450 million in cash, you have ample opportunity to overhaul your product and do some R&D and attempt to improve your bottom line. What do you do?

**Buying Bitcoin Does Not Make You an Expert at Bitcoin**

MSTR’s management decided that the best plan of action would be to “pivot into the business of Bitcoin''. Yes, a global enterprise software company is now a “bitcoin company”, and they are not employing bitcoin engineers, or mining bitcoin, or anything of that nature, but are simply converting their treasury reserves into highly volatile bitcoin.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael J Saylor said, “MicroStrategy has recognized bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy”.

For everyone out there who thinks that bitcoin is a great treasury reserve, and loves this move, we understand that there are definitely arguments that can be made for and against this move, but one of the first questions we asked was, \~“did MSTR management just wake up one day back in August and decide that they were qualified to speculate in bitcoin with virtually their entire cash balance and do they have any idea what they are doing?”.

Our thesis is NO, they do not know what they are doing and here are a few reasons we think MSTR is overvalued at current prices.

Side Note: MSTR is joined by SQ (NYSE:SQ) and SRI (NYSE:SRI) as companies converting part or all of their treasury reserves to bitcoin over the last several months.

**Current Numbers**

MSTR invested roughly $475 million into bitcoin over three transactions taking place in August, September, and December. Below is how shareholders are currently exposed to this investment. On August 10, the day before their initial purchase, MSTR was trading at a market cap valuation of $1.297 billion. As of December 10, they are now trading at a market cap valuation of $2.59 billion. They went from trading around $122/share to $288 share, a $1.5 billion increase in market cap valuation credited due to an increase in their bitcoin investment value.

Since peaking in 2014, revenue has been declining year over year and with estimates of $474mm and $479mm for FY2020 and FY2021. This trend is not predicted to change.

P/E, P/S, Who Cares? We realize it is not 1986 anymore and that the Price to Earnings Ratio does not carry the clout in today’s market that it once did, but MSTR P/E is currently spiking at 2000, nearly 50x its 5-year average of 34x. In comparison, the US software industry carries an average P/E of 53x while US stocks currently carry a P/E of 19x. MSTR is extremely overvalued based on this number.

The same can be said about their Price to Sales Ratio. The US software industry carries an average P/S 2.72x and prior to their bitcoin purchase, MSTR had a P/S of 2.65x. Today, that has doubled to 5.77x since the first announcement of their initial bitcoin purchase.

**Tender Offer**

In mid September, MSTR executed a modified dutch auction to buyback shares at up to $140/share. They ended up repurchasing 432,313 shares at an aggregate cost of $60 million.

We had to read the following headline several times to believe it.

MicroStrategy Completes $650 Million Offering of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025

First, we want to acknowledge that these terms are friendly towards MicroStrategy. The actual terms of the convertible debt do not bother us. What bothers us is the reason behind the raise.

These notes are convertible to 2.5126 shares of MSTR class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This is a conversion price of approximately $397.99/share, more than a 37% premium to where MSTR last traded.

MSTR, an enterprise software company just took on $650 million in new debt to finance the purchase of more bitcoin. Assuming they use these proceeds exclusively to purchase more bitcoin, MSTR would have roughly $1.3 billion in bitcoin. The current market cap of total bitcoin sits around $350 billion.

At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin.

**Fair Valuation**

Based on the tender offer, the market accepted $140 as a fair valuation of operating assets which included the $456mm in cash.

$475mm of their current assets transitioned to bitcoin which is now worth $791mm, for a gain of $265mm.

Translating to per share, this gain equates to $27.92/share.

So for MSTR stock price to properly account for market’s expectations for their underlying business and actual growth in MSTR’s BTC position, it should be priced at $174.13

The new debt offering further reduces this valuation due to significantly increased leverage risk. These new senior debt holders will be the first in line to get paid from this $650mm investment in new bitcoin and possibly part or all of the existing bitcoin position if bitcoin drops below the purchase price. Equity holders will only see any value from this offering if bitcoin is above the purchase price at maturity.

Could MSTR just be ahead of a new normal? 2017/2018 was the last time bitcoin dominated the headlines and really spiked. The back half of 2020 is seeing a similar trend. What if MSTR is just ahead of the market? What if they actually are some of the smartest people in the room and they are seeing value where others cannot grasp it? What if the predictions of bitcoin reaching $1 million a coin by 2025 come true? We can “what if” this decision all we want, and perhaps MSTR is a future case in a class of 2030 MBA program. “The Smartest Ones on the Street” or “What in the World Were They Thinking”. It is not fair to only mention the “bad things that can happen” regarding MSTR. They truly could be onto something here. If bitcoin continues to thrive and grow, and become a more normalized asset, decreasing historical volatility, etc, then MSTR could be an early adopter of a legitimate future normalized business asset class. Perhaps our 1986, or even 2012 mindset are blocking us from seeing the next generation and revolution of business. Although we do not think this is the case as of yet, it is certainly a possibility.

**Managing Our Position**

We are not short shares of MSTR, but are long several PUTs. Our strikes range from $100 to $330 for the April 2021 expiration. We selected this expiration based on our belief that bitcoin is a cyclical, volatile asset class that will continue to see substantial swings. At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin. We believe the market will realize this and bring the price of MSTR down so that it moves in lock step with the actual value of bitcoin. We have targeted exit points at 20%, 30%, and 50% profit targets based on our belief of MSTR declining to its fair valuation over the next few months as bitcoin investment news fades and people realize the revenue and cash flow issues are real problems moving forward. We also have a soft stop loss of roughly 30% which we believe gives us the time and wiggle room needed for our analysis to come to fruition.

MSTR is a US-based technology services company operating in the sub-sectors of business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services. The company, headquartered in Virginia, was founded by Michael J. Saylor and Sanju Bansal in 1989, Saylor remains the CEO. The firm's market cap is USD 1.3B and shares rallied +9% on the back of the news. In the announcement, MSTR, which had been discussing what to do with excess capital, will make 'bitcoin' their, 'Primary Treasury Reserve Asset,' meaning it will be their largest treasury investment. The characterization seems to imply that MSTR will be an ongoing buyer of BTC with net income in 2019 of $34M. The press releases cited considerations such as inflation protection versus fiat alternatives as the primary justification for the move.
Takeaway: The announcement comes as a surprise for crypto practitioners in that it is a massive leap above what any publicly listed entity has committed in crypto (Square would be the firm that has any argument to say otherwise). It is a bold move for a publicly listed company to essentially allocate ~20% of the company's assets towards BTC. The crypto seems likely to become a far greater contributor to the company's stock price than growth rates. The press release, however, does read somewhat like it was written by a crypto-novice. There are subtle items such as the release referring to 'bitcoin' as opposed to BTC and therefore not identifying which bitcoin chain they are referring to. In addition, the release uses the plural 'bitcoins' which is much less commonly used than the singular 'bitcoin' in the way that one says, '100k yen' and not 'yens.' Regardless, MSTR has just made a commitment that would be described as aggressive even by crypto advocates. They will be a closely followed corporate precedent for such moves.*
