1krwydx_NET,NET,Morgan Stanley turns bullish on U.S. stocks. Here’s why it says the market lows have already been made.,"Wednesday’s setup is looking weaker for equities as surging bond yields start to rattle some nerves ahead of an important auction later.

Flying in the face of this fear is Morgan Stanley and a bullish call of the day that sees the bank shift to an overweight on U.S. stocks and bonds. “Slow-but-not-dire growth makes us neutral on global stocks and constructive on fixed income, but with a strong regional preference for the U.S. across assets,” said a team of strategists including Mike Wilson.

The team previously saw the S&P 500 ￼ reaching 6,500 by the end of 2025, and now see that as a base case for the second quarter of 2026 — rolling it forward in their words. Their bull case calls for a 21% jump to 7,200 by June 2026 and a drop to 4,900 in a bear case (all from a May 19 level of 5,964).

Why the bullish turn? “We’ve already experienced rolling earnings recessions across the equity market for the last [approximately] three years. This makes comparisons less onerous and sets the stage for a more synchronous EPS [earnings per share] recovery over the course of our forecast horizon,” said Morgan Stanley’s team.

The earnings path should be aided by Fed rate cuts in 2026, dollar

And Morgan Stanley thinks the worst is over for stocks. “From our perspective, the level of tariffs announced on ‘Liberation Day’ was so dramatic, it led to what can only be described as capitulatory price action. As a result, we think that the price lows are in assuming we don’t experience a deep recession,” they said.

1kqacig_AAPL,AAPL,Morgan Stanley says Buy US Stock Dips After Moody’s Cut,"According to Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson, investors should buy any dips in US stocks fueled by Friday’s credit rating cut, as the trade truce with China has reduced the odds of a recession

The strategist sees a greater chance of a pullback in equities after Moody’s Ratings' downgrade pushed 10-year bond yields above the key 4.5% level.

Wilson wrote in a note, “We would be buyers of such a dip.”

The corporate earnings season recently ended with no major impact from the uncertainty over tariffs.

""The probability that the market looks through such weakness and deems it temporary just went up because of the trade agreement with China.""

Goldman Sachs' David Kostin expects the Magnificent Seven to resume outperforming the broader S&P 500.

1kcnepy_MS,MS,Buy/Sell stocks on Morgan Stanley portal?,"I use Vanguard for my own IRAs and brokerage account.  I'm fairly savvy in personal finance, although I'm a ""boring"" index mutual fund-type of guy.

My father (92yo) is declining in health and cognitively isn't really there any more.  He never really told my mother (84yo) about how he managed their money and she's very intimidated by the concepts.  He's very old-skool and believed money was the provider/man's territory.  And he grew up at a time where individual stocks and bonds were the most common investment.  She's agreed to let me see her accounts and they have everything with Morgan Stanley -- one joint brokerage account and two traditional IRAs.  The brokerage account is made up of \~24 random stocks and, over the past 10 years, the portfolio has trailed the S&P by 2-3% points.  This, on top of whatever MS is taking out for commissions and fees.

I was trying to explain what's going on and steer her to a mutual fund.  However, I cannot find anything on the dashboard that allows her to sell anything.  If you click the ticker, it just shows standard portfolio or market information.  My hunch is she's supposed to contact someone at MS and ask make a trade, at which point she would pay a commission.  If I'm right, I'm even more pissed off.   But I'm hoping I'm just missing something here.  Anyone use MS and can provide some insight?

Loing at the past six months, several major banks have posted impressive gains:

* **Wells Fargo :** Over e past six months, WFC has seen a significant increase in its stock price, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence.
* **Morgan Chase :** JPM has so experienced a notable upward trend, with its stock appreciating considerably during the same period.
* **Citygroup :** Similarly, Citigroup's stock has climbed, showcasing robust growth over the last half-year.

European banks also experiencing a resurgence. By April 2024, STOXX 600 Banks index reached levels not seen since 2015, indicating a robust recovery in the sector.

Is this surge driven by improved earnings, favorable economic conditions, or something else? I'm eager to hear insights from the community on what's propelling bank stocks into orbit.

1g0qgfz_PLTR,PLTR,Morgan Stanley just met with Nvidia’s CEO and came away even more confident in its top pick,"Source according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/morgan-stanley-just-met-with-nvidias-ceo-and-came-away-even-more-confident-in-their-top-pick.html) ([archive](https://archive.ph/WQiAK)): 

* Nvidia remains at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, with new opportunities to gain market share, Morgan Stanley said.

* Analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight rating on the chipmaker and said meetings with Nvidia’s CEO and other management reinforced the firm’s view that it is the top pick in semiconductors. Morgan Stanley hosted the company for a three-day nondeal road show this week.

* “We remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter-term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat,” Moore said in a Thursday note to clients. His $150 price target implies about 13.1% potential upside for the stock, which has skyrocketed nearly 167% this year.

* “This is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments,” he said.

* Long-term confidence in Nvidia’s growth remains high, the analyst said. Management highlighted opportunities in evolving generative AI inference that will scale exponentially involving “long thinking” — or inference interactions that require substantially more computation. Moore explained that these tasks will require a “much richer mix of hardware” that will provide Nvidia with a new avenue for growth.

* “NVIDIA’s upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution,” Moore said. “The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of ‘digital AI employees’ that can execute challenging tasks,” he added.

* According to Moore, Nvidia’s Blackwell systems NVL36/72 are the optimal solution for those challenges, as he believes they provide a more capable processor to the AI markets, with the GB200 systems potentially being the most important innovation as they have a “full rack” approach. Under that approach, Nvidia enables 36 or 72 GPU racks to simultaneously communicate with other graphics processing units, enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as one massive system.

* “Our view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year,” Moore said.

* The analyst is also confident that the Blackwell rollout is on schedule, with orders booked out roughly 12 months, which also drives strong short-term demand for Nvidia’s Hopper GPU architecture.

* “In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility,” Moore said.",2024-10-10,252,60

1e4mlk4_MS,MS,Morgan Stanley beats estimates on strong trading and investment banking results ,"Morgan Stanley said second-quarter profit and revenue topped analysts’ estimates on stronger-than-expected trading and investment banking results.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $1.82 a share vs. $1.65 a share LSEG estimate

Revenue: $15.02 billion, vs. $14.3 billion estimate

The bank said profit surged 41% from the year-earlier period to $3.08 billion, or $1.82 per share, helped by a rebound in Wall Street activity. Revenue rose 12% to $15.02 billion.

Morgan Stanley is likely to benefit from its Wall Street-centric business model.

The bank’s massive wealth management business will be helped by high stock market values, which inflates the management fees the bank collects.

On top of that, investment banking activity has picked up after a dismal 2023, which should provide a tailwind to the bank.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

The stock has an average rating of ""buy"" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.

Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.

Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.",2024-07-15,351,133

1d1ynfa_MS,MS,Morgan Stanley’s private equity recommendation,"Morgan Stanley purchased Etrade a couple years ago. I have most of my investments with Etrade and they have been a great platform. MS is pitching me on using a combination of private equity, credit and real estate to diversify my primarily stock/equity and limited bond/tbill portfolio. They proposed 30% of my portfolio and I pushed back and now they proposed 20% across PE, private credit and real estate. Morgan resells a variety of funds in the area from Hamilton Lane, StepStone, Blue Owl credit and a couple others.  This whole area is new to me and I’m doing lots of independent research from what MS pitched me. Everything seems to make sense on why this is a good diversification method and how potentially their returns will be strong. I have concerns since it still seems like a black box/trust me investment that also carries higher fees. I’ve done well doing what I’m doing and I understand real companies, ETFs etc  this is harder to be comfortable with. Btw I’m recently retired and pretty well set and am not doing this to chase yield. If this did the same or better while adding diversification would be good thing  Looking for opinions good or bad on moving around 20% into this. Thanks",2024-05-27,35,41

1c5en8k_MS,MS,"Morgan Stanley tops expectations on wealth management, trading and advisory results","Morgan Stanley on Tuesday posted results that topped analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue as wealth management, trading and investment banking exceeded expectations.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $2.02 a share, vs. $1.66 LSEG estimate
Revenue: $15.14 billion, vs. expected $14.41 billion
The bank said first quarter profit rose 14% from a year earlier to $3.41 billion, or $2.02 a share, helped by rising results at each of its three main divisions. Revenue rose 4% to $15.14 billion.

Wealth management revenue rose 4.9% to $6.88 billion, topping the StreetAccount estimate by $230 million, as rising markets helped boost fee revenue and offset a decline in interest income.

Equities trading revenue rose 4.1% to $2.84 billion, $160 million more than expected, fueled by derivatives volumes.

Investment banking revenue jumped 16% to $1.45 billion, edging out the $1.40 billion estimate, as increases in debt and equity issuance offset lower fees from acquisitions.


CEO Ted Pick’s tenure has kicked off on a rocky note, as high interest rates have incentivized the bank’s wealth management customers to move cash into higher-yielding securities.

But if its rivals are any indication, Morgan Stanley could be helped by strong investment banking and trading results in the quarter.

Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each topped expectations for revenue and profit, a streak continued by Goldman Sachs on Monday. Bank of America reported its quarterly results earlier Tuesday.

Analysts are likely to question Pick about reports that multiple U.S. regulators are investigating Morgan Stanley for potential shortfalls in how it screens clients for its wealth management division.

* The recent payroll data revisions have caused a shift in the baseline forecast for the March FOMC meeting from a pause to a 25bp hike.
* ***The revisions also raise the probabilities for a wide range of policy outcomes, including an increase in the magnitude of hikes, an extension of hiking, and the possibility of the next move being up after a Fed pause.***
* ***The updated data shows that if the pace of job gains from January is sustained, a 50bp hike may be firmly on the table for debate.***
* The FOMC statement shifted the focus from the pace of increases to the extent of increases, and Chair Powell suggested that the March Summary of Economic Projections could include a lower path for rates.
* The incoming data releases, including jobs and inflation prints, will provide important information on the extent and pace of the Fed's tightening path.
* ***The February payroll report is expected to show net job gains of 200k, and a repeat of a 500k+ jobs print could lead to a 50bp hike as early as the March meeting.***
* The labor market may see more resilience, which could extend the tightening cycle.
* The underlying demand dynamics point to a slowdown in jobs, and the recent job gains are likely to be a one-off and not inflecting upwards.

**Last Week – Positive reactions to CPI and Bank earnings.**

SPY closed 2.7% higher last week. That was slightly more than the 2.2% move options were pricing. Stocks reacted positively to the CPI data and closed the week on another positive note following a slew of large bank earnings. Implied volatility in options contracted following the CPI release.

**This Week – (Relatively) Low IV into the heart of earnings season.**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.3% move for this 4-day week. Implied vol in SPY options is just 13 for this Friday. In QQQ IV is 17 for this Friday, with a 1.7% expected move. IV is the lowest we’ve seen in some time, despite the slew of earnings on deck. That in turn means IV in individual names may be the lowest they’ve been into an earnings event in some time. That’s something to keep in mind with any new option positions around earnings events.

IV does start to pick back up the first week of February around the next FOMC meetings and CPI/NFP economic data. In other words, macroeconomic news is still the driver of high option vol until it isn’t.

## 

## Earnings Trading with (Relatively) Low IV

As mentioned above we enter this earnings season with a relatively different set-up than earnings seasons over the past 1-2 years. Implied Vol has come in quite a bit following some re-assuring inflation data and traders are perhaps seeing light at the end of the Fed rate hike tunnel. During the recent bouts of market volatility, options needed to price an earnings event, *but also* the potential for a broad market swoon that day or that week, Therefore, earnings expected moves weren’t necessarily pure reflections of that company’s earnings, but also carried overall market baggage. A hypothetical example from the past year would be a company with interest rate sensitivity reporting earnings the same week as important inflation data. Are options pricing earnings, or inflation, and how much of each? In a lot of cases, traders were probably more worried about the next year of Fed moves than that company’s prior quarter.

With IV lower into this earnings season, we get a clearer view of options pricing company-specific moves. And perhaps with the VIX near 19 and index IV over the next few weeks lower than we’ve seen in quite some time, it’s possible we may see individual company options actually weighed down by low index vol. Not to mention, we’ve gone from ignoring the importance of the prior quarter because of uncertainty ahead, to now having a little more certainty ahead, but really curious about what all this stuff has done to that company’s earnings recently. So, it’s a different earnings environment this time around.

Let’s take a look at Goldman Sachs, which reports tomorrow morning. Obviously, the large investment banks have been volatile over the past year as traders tried to get a read on interest rates, borrowing costs, banking/M&A activity, and more. In fact, Goldman’s realized vol, or how much the stock has moved over the past year is about 29. That can be compared to IV for this week’s earnings in GS, which is about 25. Quick translation: options are actually cheaper into this earnings than GS stock has traded on average over the past year. And looking at the expected move for GS for this week we see options pricing a 2.6% move, or about $10 in either direction. For comparison, with the market rally off the CPI, and then a sympathetic rally with fellow financial institutions like JPM off their earnings on Friday, GS was up 6%, or $21 last week. And that’s without knowing what they’ll report tomorrow.

With that information at hand, it may make sense to compare credit and debit spreads to express a view. Typically credit spreads into earnings take advantage of high implied vol, and build a buffer of not only the potential move in the stock, but also by being on the correct side of falling IV after the event. But in this case, it’s helpful to look at the risk/reward of credit vs debit spreads when IV isn’t sky-high.

Let’s say you want to take a bearish stance on GS earnings, based on the rally into the event. Based on Goldman’s close of 374 on Friday, an at-the-money credit call spread for this week with the upper strike set at the expected move (selling the 375 call, buying the 385 call) risks about 6.50 to make 3.50. It loses money if GS stock is above 378.50 on Friday, just 4.50 higher than Friday’s close. Compare that to an at-the-money debit put spread (buying the 375 put, selling the 365 put) that risks 4 to make 6, with a breakeven around 371, just $3 lower in the stock: (see the trade here on [Options AI's free tool](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/GS/put-spread))

This is a case where the breakevens of credit spreads are really tight, compared to how the stock has been trading, as are the breakevens of debit spreads. The issue with debit spreads is always that you need a move in your direction, while with credit spreads you have a buffer built in to be slightly wrong. But in low IV environments that advantage starts to blur, and the risk/reward of what seem like very likely moves can come into better focus.

Mike Wilson, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer, said he believes Wall Street’s excitement over [the idea that interest rate hikes may slow sooner than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html) is premature and problematic.

“The market always rallies once the Fed stops hiking until the recession begins. … \[But\] it’s unlikely there’s going to be much of a gap this time between the end of the Fed hiking campaign and the recession,**″** he told CNBC’s “[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)” on Wednesday. “Ultimately, this will be a trap.”

According to Wilson, the most pressing issues are the effect the economic slowdown will have on corporate earnings and the risk of the Federal Reserve over-tightening.

“The market has been a bit stronger than you would have thought given the growth signals have been consistently negative,” he said. “Even the bond market is now starting to buy into the fact that the Fed is probably going to go too far and drive us into recession.”

## ‘Close to the end’

Wilson has a 3,900 year-end price target on the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX), one of the lowest on Wall Street. That implies a [3% dip from Wednesday’s close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/stock-futures-tick-up-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html) and a 19% drop from the index’s closing high hit in January.

His forecast also includes a call for the market to take another leg lower before getting to the year-end target. Wilson is bracing for the S&P to fall below 3,636, the 52-week low hit last month.

“We’re getting close to the end. I mean this bear market has been going on for a while,” Wilson said. “But the problem is it won’t quit, and we need to have that final move, and I don’t think the June low is the final move.”

Wilson believes the S&P 500 could fall as low as 3,000 in a 2022 recession scenario.

“It’s really important to frame every investment in terms of ‘What is your upside versus your downside,’” he said. “You’re taking a lot of risk here to achieve whatever is left on the table. And, to me, that’s not investing.”

Wilson considers himself [conservatively positioned](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/bear-market-rally-setting-stage-for-correction-morgan-stanley-warns.html) — noting he’s underweight stocks and likes defensive plays including [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLV), [REITs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IYR), [consumer staples](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLP) and [utilities](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLU). He also sees the merits of holding extra [cash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY) and [bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) at the moment.

And, he’s not in a rush to put money to work and has been “hanging out” until there are signs of a trough in stocks.

“We’re trying to give them \[clients\] a good risk-reward. Right now, the risk-reward, I would say, is about 10 to one negative,” Wilson said. “It’s just not great.”",2022-08-14,1336,310

Morgan Stanley 

Earnings of $1.39 per share vs $1.53 of estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Revenue of $13.13 billion vs $13.48 billion estimate

vyz4dz_MS,MS,Trade Morgan Stanley Earning with Iron Butterfly,"**Morgan Stanley (MS)** reported its earnings for the quarter ended June 30 on 07/14 before market open. The analysts estimated revenue was **$13.50B**, down **-8.8%** from the previous quarter. The anticipated EPS was **$1.61**, down **-21.8%** from from last quarter. The reported revenue and EPS were **$13.13B** and **$1.44**, missed analysts' estimates by **-2.71**% and **-10.40%** respectively.

**What I traded**

On 7/13 before market closed, I opened an Iron Butterfly position as below (The max profit was actually $275. The difference is due to the delayed data feeds):

[Iron Butterfly Position](https://preview.redd.it/qcc6l5rnrjb91.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d093073e292d2de78a1bd082a933662f425074)

This is a direction neutral strategy, so I'd be profitable if stock price moves between breakeven points, which are $72-$78.

**How I came up with this trade**

MS stock hovered around $75 before market close on 7/13.  The ATM straddle expired on **7/15** was priced at $3.50.  So the MS expected post-earning price move was between **$75± $3.5**. This is known as the **implied move (market expected move, anticipated move, etc.)**.

[ATM Straddle](https://preview.redd.it/yyq913oktjb91.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff545e52c7d83dbc96a06f3b64a79477013cc6c6)

During the last 4 earnings events, MS post-earning stock price all landed square within the anticipated move.  This indicates that for Morgan Stanley, the market tends to overestimate the actual move.

[Implied vs Actual Move](https://preview.redd.it/mjpzhyk6vjb91.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=c416ad1648612920e2ee3d0f1c545ce78f1b965b)

Going into the earnings, the sentiment for the bank sector has been very negative.  MS stock price has been plunging over the last three months, while the IV has been ramping up.

[Price and IV](https://preview.redd.it/ciar7dzcwjb91.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4f2269d0553af04663f71519af1e7c1770df15)

With the historical moves, price action and the IV trend, I perceived these as signals to short both vega and gamma (expect IV to crush but stock price barely moves after earnings announcement).

**What the result looks like**

On 7/13 3:55pm, I submitted a limit order which was executed with $2.75 credits.

[Open Order](https://preview.redd.it/hfgfjb0nxjb91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a4982cf875f2fec5da3e11b16851fa07afa425a)

MS stock dipped after market open amid its worse than expected earning results.

&#x200B;

On its way down I decided to close my call side with $0.28 debit.  Given the initial  $1.31 credit collected from the call side, I realized $1.03 profit.

[Call Spread Close Order](https://preview.redd.it/3wvs5itpyjb91.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=3110e540f40a4b500b35bc14f665953a8562056a)

&#x200B;

The lowest point the stock price hit was $72, close to the lower end of the anticipated move. Then around 9:45 the stock started rallying back up.  I decided to close my put side when the stock price hit $74.  The total debit I paid was $1.4, which is roughly the same amount of credit I collected initially. So I'm breakeven on the put side.

[Put Spread Close Order](https://preview.redd.it/qfcjo8j20kb91.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a67388e3cc05c9c5d786576e435791eb018af6d)

In conclusion I risked roughly $220 to get $100 profit. Although the calculated chance of profit is only 50%, with the historical data I have higher conviction with this trade. As of noon 7/14, the stock has rally to $74.50, leading to a non-mover situation.  This behavior aligns well with how historically it performed after earnings announcement.  So I'm very likely to place the same trade in the next MS earning.

viyn5d_AMD,AMD,"AMD stock now at a ‘reasonable valuation’ after near-50% pullback, Morgan Stanley says","If the semiconductor surge comes to an end, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could be best positioned to sustain the pullback, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote Wednesday.

AMD AMD, -0.05% shares performed slightly better Wednesday compared with those of other chip makers, which saw shares decline overall, after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the stock now that Xilinx, which was acquired in February, is firmly a part of AMD. Morgan Stanley was identified as the lead financial adviser for Xilinx, when the deal was announced in October 2020.

Analyst Joseph Moore established an overweight rating and $103 price target, writing that the company “offers potential for solid numbers at a reasonable valuation,” given its near-50% selloff from late-November highs. “Overall, we are optimistic that the company’s prospects in data center (CPU, GPU, and FPGA) will provide enough growth to drive further positive estimate revisions over the next several quarters,” Moore said in a note.

AMD shored up its data-center offerings when it closed on its purchase of Xilinx, which specializes in field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, chips that can be configured by a customer or a designer after they are made. Those chips, in turn, are used as accelerators in data centers to boost computing power and improve power efficiency in existing physical spaces. 

“Apprehensions we see in the consumer linked end-markets should leave AMD less exposed comparatively than key competitors, allowing us to underwrite conservative numbers that shouldn’t surprise much to the downside,” Moore said.

Analysts are concerned that the explosion in semiconductor sales amid a pandemic-influenced supply crunch could lead to a severe downturn in the months ahead, as inventories build and customers halt purchases. That has been a major factor in a strong downturn for chip stocks in the first half of the year. “While a digestion phase in PCs and consoles appears likely, and we are budgeting for some caution next year, we believe strength in server (with further market share gains) should allow the company to keep posting solid growth at a now reasonable valuation,” Moore said.

Separately, AMD announced late Wednesday it appointed Mathew Hein to the position of chief strategy officer, effective Monday. Hein comes from investment banking firm DBO Partners, where he was lead adviser to AMD “on a number of opportunities.” Up until 2013, Hein worked at Morgan Stanley for 17 years, where Hein held positions such as Technology Investment Banking Group managing director, and global head of Semiconductor Banking. Reporting directly to AMD Chief Executive and Chair Lisa Su, “Hein will be responsible for advancing the company’s strategy across an expanded market for high-performance and adaptive computing solutions and will work closely with the AMD executive team to accelerate the company’s next phase of growth.”

Earlier in the month, AMD doubled-down on its commitment to expand its data center offerings, and forecast average annual revenue growth of about 20% over the next three to four years, while sticking to its second-quarter and annual forecast provided in early May. 

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect revenue of $6.43 billion for the second quarter, compared with AMD’s estimated $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, and $26.2 billion for the year, based on AMD’s estimate of about $26.3 billion.

Wilson and his team stuck to their 3,400 end-of-year price target for the index, which represents a 10% drop from current levels, but also argued stocks could fall further in a recessionary scenario in which corporate earnings take a hit.

t65ubm_INTC,INTC,"Intel (INTC) Stock Falls on Morgan Stanley Downgrade to Underweight, Analyst Says 'All-or-Nothing Situation' Carries High Risk","""Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are down 2% in pre-open Thursday after Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $47.00 per share (down from the prior $55.00).

Although Moore says he likes the turnaround story that is underway at Intel, he argues that “the next couple of years are likely to see the stock move sideways and we see more actionable opportunities elsewhere in our coverage.

In particular, Moore prefers GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) to Intel as the former “acts as a hedge against the risk of both US gov't support for domestic foundry and new business opportunities moving out of Asia as customers diversify.”

“While INTC is betting big on its foundry business, and recently purchased a smaller foundry in Tower Semiconductor, GFS already has a strong and growing customer base based on proven know-how and manufacturing capability,” Moore said in a client note.

In essence, Moore doesn’t see a clear positive catalyst path for Intel.

“The aggressive investment in capacity in pursuit of revenue growth opportunities in foundry and graphics point to minimal free cash flow in the next couple of years - as guided, to be clear - but also drive a substantial increase in the underlying components of cost of sales (depreciation, labor, and overhead seem likely to rise 40%+ in the forecast horizon, in contrast to sales growth that's forecasted to be negative this year and low single digits next year),” the analyst added.

Moreover, Moore questions whether Intel can still be seen as a value play as “the reality is that ramp of fixed costs create a more ""all-or-nothing"" situation where the company is going to need to succeed in these new businesses - and still turn around their core business - or be looking at long term gross margin and cash flow degradation.”

The analyst also upgraded GFS to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $72.50 per share price target, while downgrading Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Teradyne (NASDAQ: TER) Equal-Weight from Overweight""

qsfcb3_MS,MS,Financing cash via MS Reversal,"Hey guys, I have question about a potential way to finance your negative cash in a margin. A friend & I thought about potential downsides of this method but we couldn’t find anything, so please let me hear if there is anything popping in your head.

The following trade:

A synthetic long MS & at the same time shorting 100 Shares.

I did the math and the following numbers occur:

\- $318 (Credit for the synthetic long)

\- $280 (100\*0.7\*4, Dividend payments for the 100 short shares, assuming the dividend amount doesn't change as MS has already increased the dividends by 100% in July 2021)

\- $24.63$ (98.52$\*100\*0.0025, Short sell fee rate 0.25%)

= 318 - 280 - 24.63

=13.37$ (This surplus will likely be spend on commissions)

&#x200B;

So following this, we will have 100 shares short on MS, which will decrease interest paid on account by:

100\*98,52\*0.018 (assuming 1.8% interest)

=177.34$

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you had fun during my absence! Earnings season is picking back up again, with banks leading the charge. We’ve got nine of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. Given that you’ve read my post on [*collateral plays*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/), or are well versed in theta gang strategies, there’s an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move relatively predictably post-earnings. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since 3 of the 9 banks report on Tuesday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Tuesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you’re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they’ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you’re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You’ll get IV crushed and the move won’t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you’re exposing yourself to.

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

*Nine* of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfPzgjt0mLyhOJUYBEmk4Fd3IpTTyWtkfF12d5L0RBI/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the links which can be found on my profile or in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-07-11,129,38

Thesis and Technical Analysis:
The stock peaked in the $55 area
last January and was hit hard during
the pandemic, falling all the way
to $26. Following that bottom, the
shares completed a large bullish
“V” bottom reversal pattern in early
November. They then moved higher
until January 2021, tested the rising
10-week exponential average, and
then rose until March, peaking
near $86. Over the past couple of
months, MS traced out a bullish cup
back to its 50-day and broke out this
month. Financials in general were
weak in 2020, but some late-year
strength and 2021 YTD strength has
helped the sector. A finished cup

ms3bqn_MS,MS,"Morgan Stanley tops earnings estimates on better-than-expected trading, investment banking results","Although they lost $911mln with Archegos, it was a low impact event overall, and MS remains an excellent stock, with a diverse FICC portfolio, collateralized assets all around (including level 3), stretching their legs throughout every aspect of high finance (intangible vertical integration, essentially), etc.

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

Record revenue and earnings are likely products of a busy year of acquisitions in 2020, which included the purchase of e*trade and Eaton Vance.

As a part of a larger trend, MS looks to be undergoing a transformation, achieving most of their revenues through trading, asset/wealth management, and fees and commissions rather than investment banking and interest revenues.

Here are the key figures:

Earnings: $1.70 a share, 68% higher than a year earlier, according to Refinitiv

Revenue: $14.1 billion, 49% higher than a year earlier

mfvovp_MS,MS,What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 means,"MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

iulj89_TSLA,TSLA,"$TSLA - Morgan Stanley previews Battery Day with ""7 Mind Blowing Things"" they're expecting","Morgan Stanley:

""Ahead of Tesla's Battery Day on Sep 22nd, we publish some expectation 'benchmarks' for scale, efficiency, cost and technology that we believe may come to light. Based on our work with our Asia Tech team, we expect the event to be potentially narrative changing for Tesla and the battery market.""

""Elon Musk has promised 'mind blowing' battery tech to be unveiled during the highly anticipated September 22nd Battery Day. Our key expectation benchmarks to look out for:

1. **Capacity. We are prepared for Tesla to target Terawatt scale battery capacity plans.** Currently, we forecast Tesla to produce 439 GwH of batteries for their in-house production and 3rd party supply (combined) by 2030, accounting for just over a 26% share of the global EV battery market. Will Tesla target 1TwH by 2035? Or more/sooner?
2. **Battery manufacturing/production efficiency… 16-fold improvement?** With Maxwell, there would be theoretically a 16x production capacity increase by skipping the wet toxic chemicals to create the cathode, which then has to be dried and baked-off and needs a lot of floor space and ovens to meet that process.
3. **A doubling of energy density?** Battery density using the DBE system shows greater than 300 Wh/kg with a path to over 500 Wh/kg. By comparison, Tesla's most advanced (2170) battery today is around 247 Wh/kg. This implies potential to add 20% to its current highest density and could double it in the future. This could lead to vehicles with significantly more range – and could potentially push Tesla Model 3 to about 400 miles per charge with upside from there.
4. **Longevity… 1 million mile battery.** Battery life also shows improved durability with almost 2x improvement as Elon Musk recently stated ‘…the car battery pack is around 3-to-5,000 miles, but the newly designed pack that will go into production for next year is design\[ed\] explicitly for a million miles of operation with minimum maintenance...’. Extension of battery life has implications for cost of ownership, warranty, 2nd/3rd life battery use and buying time to allow the battery recycling infrastructure to catch up.
5. **Goodbye Cobalt?** Tesla has been spending a great deal of effort on researching new chemistries themselves to reduce and remove cobalt from the mix. Tesla’s battery research group led by Jeff Dahn in Halifax applied for a patent in November 2017 that describes a new battery cell chemistry that would result in faster charging and discharging, better longevity, and even lower cost. This has important ESG considerations as well.
6. **Battery $/KwH Targets:** The prevailing view is that battery cell cost can decline at a compound rate of 6 to 7% from just over a $100/KwH level today. Could Tesla communicate plans to potentially double this rate of deflation or to target $50/KwH or less by mid or latter this decade due to the additive/compounding effects of their process efficiencies, scale and energy density improvements? Additionally, we are looking out for an evolution in battery format that could be cylindrical with bigger diameter than the 2170\[0\]’s. Tesla is building a pilot production line to test mass production.
7. **An expectation that Tesla could emerge as a full-stack battery competitor...** Overall, the market appears to be leaning towards Tesla being a faster moving partner with scale that expands the market for all and investors are likely looking to reengage on existing battery makers post the battery day. Investors will likely also be looking closely at the state of collaboration with CATL. The million mile battery or cobalt-free battery is also a pipeline of CATL’s new technology. Tesla and CATL could potentially own the patents of those new technologies together and CATL would potentially be able to help industrialize new battery production.""",2020-09-17,84,116

hiph9e_MS,MS,"Morgan Stanley says ad boycott is a buy opportunity for $FB, but less bullish on $TWTR","Over the past week, big advertisers like Unilever and Starbucks said they will join an advertising boycott of select social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter in response to what they say is a failure of these platforms to stop the spread of hate. The boycotts vary in length from just the month of July to year end 2020. Morgan Stanley (MS) estimates \~250 advertisers have joined the boycott to date, but only 13 of the largest 100 advertisers in the US.

MS says this is a good buying opportunity for FB because:

1. FB's ad dollar base is ""highly diversified"" - management said on its 1Q19 call that the top 100 advertisers represent less than 20% of total ad revenue. FB's advertiser base has likely grown by more than 10% and even more diverse since then (8m as of 4Q19 vs. 7mn in 4Q18);
2. FB has a strong direct-response (DR) transaction-driven ad product - DR advertisers will almost certainly step in and bid if/when pricing drops if large advertisers pull back on spend. DR advertisers spend is likely very strong now given the current momentum in e-commerce (growing at 50%+ vs. typically teens run-rate);
3. MS estimates every month of revenue lost from ALL top 100 FB advertisers = just \~1% of annual revenue and 3% of annual EPS.

MS sees more risk at TWTR from the boycott vs. FB because:

A) TWTR has a much lower total advertiser account (<1m advertisers vs. 8m at FB) which means more concentrated ad dollar base and more vulnerable if/when the largest advertisers pull back on ad spend.

f1gijy_MS,MS,Biogen Soars on Patent Win for MS Drug Tecfidera Over Mylan,"Shares of Biogen Inc. BIIB rallied 17.5% on Wednesday after the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent And Trademark Office (USPTO) gave a favorable ruling to the company over a patent dispute with Mylan MYL for its best-selling multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tecfidera.

Mylan in an inter partes review (IPR) was challenging Biogen’s ‘514 patent, which covers the treatment of multiple sclerosis with 480mg dose of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the active ingredient of Tecfidera. The patent provides market exclusivity in the United States until 2028.

Per the statement from the PTAB, generic drugmaker Mylan failed to demonstrate that some claims were not patentable.

Though Mylan announced its intention to appeal against this decision, the favorable ruling raises hopes for Biogen’s chances of maintaining Tecfidera’s exclusivity until 2028. Tecfidera constituted 39% of the company’s total product revenues in 2019.

The news removes a short-term overhang from the company. Biogen also faces a generic litigation in a court case related to the same patent. The favorable ruling increases the chances of winning the court case.

Shares of Biogen have increased 7.8% in the past year versus the industry’s decrease of 0.1%.

￼

Notably, in 2017, Biogen strengthened its patent position for Tecfidera through a settlement and licensing agreement with Danish biotech Forward Pharma A/S regarding the same patent. Per the settlement, Biogen agreed to pay $1.25 billion for buying the license to Forward Pharma’s intellectual property covering DMF.

Meanwhile, last week, Biogen delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2019 results. The company beat on both earnings and sales in the reported quarter.

Revenue growth in the quarter was principally driven by higher sales of its key MS drugs, continued global growth of its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza and expansion of its biosimilar business.

Notably, Tecfidera has been one of the top revenue drivers for Biogen over the years. The drug generated sales worth $4.4 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector include Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. XENE and Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. KALA, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Xenon Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 12.04% for 2020 over the past 60 days. The stock has soared 85.7 % in the past year.

Kala Pharmaceuticals’ loss per share estimates have narrowed 0.9% for 2020 over the past 60 days.

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020.

He said they offer more than just investing services such as banking, budgeting, writing of will, etc. 

However the most interesting part is the investing. I currently have my employer 401K as well as a maxed out Roth IRA with Fidelity. What he proposed to me was an actively managed account with a fee of 1.25% per year compounded on a quarterly basis. My benefit is that supposedly they outperform the market, a claim for which he brought no supporting evidence. I'll be honest, I certainly don't outperform the market. However for me to pay a 1.25% fee through good times and bad, I'd like to know with certainty that they can in fact outperform the market. He proposed to have a second meeting with one of their experts to answer all of my questions. Do you guys have suggestions?

#Industry News
•	Offshore Drilling: President Obama permanently blocked oil and gas drilling in federally controlled areas of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, as well as areas off of the East Coast of the continental U.S. The move comes after environmentalists have called upon the President to put Arctic waters off limits to drilling following Shell’s failed attempt to drill in the area. Obama will employ a little-used provision of the Offshore Continental Shelf Lands Act, which allows presidents to designate offshore areas as national monuments in a process similar to that of Antiquities Act which presidents have often called upon to create national monument sites. The Offshore Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes the president to make these designations without the approval of Congress. Congress can override such designations, but would require 60 votes in the Senate. The president is not expressly authorized to do so. No president has ever sought to repeal a monument designation, putting such an effort by Trump in uncharted legal territory should it come to pass.

•	Saudi Arabia: Will announce fuel price increases of 40% when it launches its general budget for 2017 on Thursday, local newspaper Al-Watan reported Tuesday.  The Council of Economic and Development Affairs, chaired by Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, met Monday to discuss the draft budget, which will also include a 20% rise in electricity tariffs, Al-Watan said.  The ministry of finance was not available for comment.  If confirmed, the increase in fuel and power prices would be the second after the kingdom made a dramatic change in policy last year. In its 2016 budget, it increased long-standing prices for gasoline and domestic gas for power generation as well as ethane feedstock as part of a broader program to cut subsidies and reduce the budget deficit.

#Company News 
•	ENLK: EnLink Midstream Partners and EnLink Midstream announce non-core divestiture transactions. EnLink agreed to monetize its approximately 31% common ownership interest in HEP for net proceeds of approximately $190M. Alberta Investment Management corp and management will acquire a common ownership stake in HEP as a result of EnLink's divestiture, which follows AIMCo's preferred investment in HEP in August 2016 Blended multiple of 16x is attractive and the co’s are accelerating SCOOP/STACK development a plus with this announcement. Expect stock to react favorably now that Tall Oak installment and '17 capex funding in good shape Asset sale proceeds and anticipated ongoing equity sales should fund 2017 capital needs alleviating any fears of a equity overnight or expanded preferred issuance. Louisiana ngl operations should be full in the second half setting up some sort of NGL handling expansion and/or either the Oklahoma Express pipe project or further processing expansion in Oklahoma.

#Trading Recap
•	HFs were net buyers of N. American equities on Tuesday due to both longs added and shorts covered. ETFs were the most net bought while Cons Disc was the most net sold; most single-name sectors had paired off activity yesterday.

Energy was net sold yesterday and has been net sold for 9 of the past 11 trading sessions; Yesterday’s activity was once again driven by E&P.

#Econ/Macro
•	Cyclical Trade: The cyclical trade recovered yesterday (MSZZCYDE +50bps) lead by Financials +112 & Industrials +62bps and despite weak volumes we did see extensions of the post-election thematic trades.  Financials continue to separate from other sectors,  FIN/FANG spread increased to 19.8% since Election & Domestic companies continue to outperform those that are Internationally levered. (MS)

They're not going anywhere, 4-5% dividends. F has been a buy-and-hold's dream stock, while VLKAY seems toxic. But I think people will still buy VWs; 50% is oversold.


* **AAPL** Faces headwinds from their potential stars (Apple watch) failing, and cash cow (iphone) plateauing in growth. 10 PE and 2.15% dividend, with possibility of dividend growth, given all cash on hand. Apple-Car hype hasn't been factored in, either. **IBM** is something Buffett is always buying, and it's at a 30% discount to where he was buying about 2 years ago. Also PE < 10

* **MU**: Institutional favorite and PE < 6.

25q5st_MS,MS,Questions about getting an MS in Finance after an unrelated degree,"I am strongly considering going through and taking the GMAT and applying for MSF programs for 2015. I really enjoyed statistics and economics in high school, and think this would be a great fit. I have been assured by multiple institutions that having other backgrounds is fine, and that as long as I have a competitive GMAT score, acceptance will not be an issue; however I worry about the job market. 

I have two degrees in music performance, and am realizing just how slim my chances are of landing a gig with an orchestra. If I could go back and change it all, I would. I've been living a dream that is next to impossible. 

After doing some research, I've realized that corporate finance would probably be my best fit. When a company looks at my resume, sees an MS in Finance and then... two degrees in music... will they cast it aside? Are there ways I can boost my resume to make myself more attractive to corporations? Any and all advice is welcome. ",2014-05-16,1,11
