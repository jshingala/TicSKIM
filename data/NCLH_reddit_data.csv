1b56dlk_NCLH,NCLH,Is $NCLH a buy?,"Hello everybody this is my first post and I wanted to know what your thoughts are on Norwegian Cruise Line? I took a look at their 10k and I did notice that they operated at a loss from 2020-2022 but had a positive rebound in 2023. Also they do rely on a good amount of short term debt as part of operations (which they have also been paying off). I’m looking at this more longterm. Since debt is a big part of its capital structure, the lowered interest rates should expand margins and hopefully dive the price of the stock. As a disclaimer I own no shares of this company and just wanted more opinions on it, thanks!",2024-03-03,5,21
1b1i5rt_NCLH,NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line reports first profitable year since 2019,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings on Tuesday reported its first profitable year since 2019 as fourth-quarter losses narrowed dramatically.

The cruise company reported strong growth and ticket demand with an encouraging 2024 forecast. Shares of the company surged 17% following the report.

Here’s how Norwegian performed in the fourth quarter compared with estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 18 cents vs. 14 cents expected

Revenue: $1.99 billion vs. $1.97 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Norwegian reported a net loss of $106.5 million, an improvement from a loss of $482.5 million in the year-ago period. The company’s loss per share narrowed to 25 cents from $1.14 the prior year. Adjusting for one-time items, Norwegian reported a loss per share of 18 cents.

For the full year, the company generated total revenue of $8.55 billion, a 32% increase from 2019, with a net income of $166.2 million. In 2022, Norwegian lost $2.27 billion.

The company saw 102.9% occupancy for the year. Total revenue per passenger per day increased 17% from pre-pandemic levels.

The company said it received robust demand for most of its cruises except those traveling through the Middle East, which were canceled due to the violence in Gaza. The cancellations only caused a slight dip in occupancy in the fourth quarter to 99.2%, the company said.

“Norwegian Cruise Line Holding experienced a momentous year of growth and achievement in 2023,” CEO Harry Sommer said in a statement. “We successfully took delivery of three new ships, one for each of our brands, representing the most deliveries in a single year in our Company’s 57-year history. This important milestone showcases our dedication to innovation and commitment to providing exceptional vacation experiences for our guests.”

The company said it’s currently at record-high booking levels due to “healthy consumer demand” across the fourth quarter and full year.

For the full year 2024, the company expects an adjusted profit of about $635 million, or $1.23 per share, and an occupancy rate of about 105%. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated 2024 earnings per share of $1.21.

Shares of other cruise companies, including Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corp., also rose Tuesday morning.

Just observations and my own thoughts you need to do your own due diligence. COVID Delta impact worst case is now priced in and overblown. Ontario recovered dramatically due to vaccine rates and US has more access to vaccines. $NCLH is oversold and has recovered strongly with each new positive news. As a boomer, too many of us can't wait to cruise again.** 

**Disclosure I have take a long position in shares in NCLH at $23.9, personal PT of $30**

I'm Canadian and looking at the impact of social distancing, masking and restrictions? They didn't blunt the spread of new variants. We had experienced massive increases in new cases because the general population will cheat and often not follow rules. However once vaccinations started reaching critical masses, even with delta, the new case counts have continued to decline.

I believe the impact of Delta on the US is therefore over hyped and there are strong opportunities for the US Gov to turn this around exponentially faster then Canada (took 3 months) because the US has better access to vaccines and are better at offering incentives (perks, mandating, lotteries).

What is the opportunity? Looking at the statistics, spending is going to be around age 18-59 and therefore as they increasingly are fully vaccinated Delta and covid new case rates will become less and less of an impact.

Recovery stocks have become dramatically oversold based on Delta hype and therefore represent an opportunity once US vaccine rates improve enough in metro areas to destroy Covid new case counts.

$NCLH Norwegian Cruise lines has entered oversold and a bounce is underway. It has bounced with positive news over the past few months and is primed for an ever strong potential strong price recovery

nxukcb_NCLH,NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)," 

Cruise  lines got beat badly by virus, as did most others, but have turned last  few months up with NCLH up 400% from their Yr low.  This week has been a  mean one for NCLH.  Last week it broke above Resistance (Approx $32)  & this week news that passengers on a Carnival ship (CCL) had virus  they were slapped around but have held at the previous Resistance level.   I'm expecting a bounce off Resistance & return to $34ish level  next week.  The change (increase) in Short %ages may reflect a Short  attack this week.

Schwab shows 12%  Short requiring 2-3 days to cover (RI Ratio) with Schwab data being  posted on 4Jun.  Previous data posting by Schwab in mid May had Shorts  at 9+%.  Not difficult to assume NCLH was hit wShort attack based on  virus news.  Volume 2Dy was 12Mil while 5Dy Avg Vol is 14Mil & 20Dy  Avg is 18Mil.  I'm reading 2Dys price action (Holding previous  Resistance level & moving up approx $1) as an indication there may  have been Institutional (Own 56%) support & certainly no panic  selling from passenger virus news.

I'm a supporter of concept when (not if) cruise lines go higher leaving open the questions of how fast & how high.

Conversely,  I could easily be convinced that Shorts are extended & NCLH may be  sitting in a nice position for renewed buying next week & there may  be some folks changing their shorts.  JMO.  Arguments appreciated.",2021-06-12,6,4

nxj51i_RCL,RCL,$NCLH - DD on COVID cases on RCL,"Hey retards, as stated on my previous post, I have been heavily invested on NCLH for a while, investing roughly $80k on Jan 2022 calls.

Although I have taken a bit of profits, I have roughly $60k still running on this option calls. Here is why I think there might still be upside potential and, at the same time buying opportunity ahead of us. This is not financial advice.

- First off, it’s important to flag that the market cap of NCLH hasn’t recovered to pre-pandemic levels while other cruise lines have. If you add inflation to it plus increased demand, there is an argument that there is a 10 to 20% upside left. PT for some analysts on the street is around $38 to $40 a share.

- As the news broke out today, there were 2 COVID cases on one of the 95% vaccinated RCL cruise. This will cause some short term panic but, if the cases remain only at 2, this is great news! Why? Remember, the most effective vaccine currently has a 95% efficacy which means that, in a crew+passengers of 2000 people, we expect at least 100 people to be potentially contaminated (5% of 2000). So anything less than a 100 cases is actually better odds than you just going to a bar or restaurant on your own.

- NCLH is also the best prepared for these scenarios, as they are pushing for fully vaccinated crews/passenger while other cruise companies are doing a hybrid approach (i.e. you pay more if you are not vaccinated). Right now, a few cases in a cruise ship are inevitable but an outbreak will bring the industry to a halt. So NCLH has the better odds on not having an outbreak.

With all of those points, there is also some risks ahead of the industry:

- Political issues in case the company cant require vaccination certifications: In those cases, outbreaks will be inevitable, which will cause hesitancy on new passengers and potentially reduced US sailings. In this case, I will sell my options as I think the risk is too big.

- Current cases become an outbreak of 100s of people. Same as before, could cause hesitancy and problem in the industry overall.

- Vaccines don’t work: then the whole stock market will crash.

Once again, thread carefully and take profits when you can. Use short term panic as buying opportunities.

There are very few industries that have been completely, 100% shut down for the entirety of the pandemic. The cruiseship industry is one of them. There’s a lot of fear around the stock, but now that vaccine distribution is on the rise it’s inevitable that cruising will resume. For cruise line companies, the strategy is simple: if you have proof of being vaccinated, you can board the ship… the only issue is the government giving them the go-ahead, which is just a matter of time.

The way I see it, there are three ways you can approach this opportunity.

**Low risk**: buy NCLH shares and hold

**Medium risk**: Jan 21 2022 $30c

**The WSB special**: Sep 17 2021 ???c

I have done all three. 472 shares at $17.56, 4x Jan 21 2022 $30c, 3x Sep 17 $17.50c.

**WHAT THE WORRIERS SAY:**

ljigkl_RCL,RCL,Now is the best time to buy cruise ship calls (NCLH) (xpost r/options),"tl;dr NCLH calls = 🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕

There are very few industries that have been completely, 100% shut down for the entirety of the pandemic. The cruiseship industry is one of them. There’s a lot of fear around the stock, but now that vaccine distribution is on the rise it’s inevitable that cruising will resume. For cruise line companies, the strategy is simple: if you have proof of being vaccinated, you can board the ship… the only issue is the government giving them the go-ahead, which is just a matter of time.

The way I see it, there are three ways you can approach this opportunity.

**Low risk**: buy NCLH shares and hold

**Medium risk**: Jan 21 2022 $30c

**The WSB special**: Sep 17 2021 ???c

I have done all three. 472 shares at $17.56, 4x Jan 21 2022 $30c, 3x Sep 17 $17.50c.

**WHAT THE WORRIERS SAY:**

-“New vaccine-resistant covid mutation will ruin everything.” Seems unlikely, and even if it happens it could be months after you already cash in.

-“The shares have been diluted.” Yes, it won’t return to the $60 highs anytime soon… but it doesn’t have to. Optimistically, the shares could reach $40 if there’s proof of cruising being successful again.

lgwic9_RCL,RCL,"Cruise Line Stocks like CCL, NCLH and RCL","Hello,

I wanna take a minute to talk about the following stocks ...

**Cruise Line Stocks**

* RatioCarnival Corp. (CCL)
* Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH)
* Royal Caribbean Group (RCL)

I have noticed that these stocks have crashed hard because of the COVID virus/situation. It would make logic sense for them to recover once everything returns to normal. However nobody knows when this will happen, or even if this will ever be the case. We might be getting a new normal in the future. On the otherhand, will the damage to the company be to big? They've lost a lot of revenue during this period. Aswell there is the factor of polution. Just my 2cents.

So the repeat my question: Anyone has a DD on any of these kind of stocks? 

To add another question: What is your opinion on these stocks?

Kind regards

I think NCLH does have the potential to get to $26.50 by option expire, given the run up this week. With that being said the YTD high has been $26.96 so we will see. One bad article out COVID and it will drop again.

I also raised my RCL price up $1.50. The stock has simply been on fire and a strike of $64.50 wouldn't have been much premium to collect.

If you're trying to play a bull market 7-14 day run, I think these calls are the way to go since cruise trades in-line with market sentiment / corona fears. If NCLH goes up 10% next week, these calls could easily 5x. I'd advise hedging slightly with OOM near-dated SPY puts (or just initiating a smaller NCLH position).

**Politics:**

* Trump administration will try to push a biotech firm to release good news for COVID vaccines before election. He also said that a vaccine could be available around the election time.

* JPow and Mnuchin join forces to testify against congress to pass the stimulus bill.

[https://stansberryresearch.com/articles/mnuchin-and-powell-signal-willingness-to-work-with-congress-on-providing-more-support-2](https://stansberryresearch.com/articles/mnuchin-and-powell-signal-willingness-to-work-with-congress-on-providing-more-support-2)

**Pfizer (PFE):**

* PFE will try to reveal whether the vaccine works or not by end of Oct. If the trials show that the vaccine is promising, vaccine production will pursue the following month. Also claims that that their trials aren’t rushed and assures that their trials outcome will not have been influenced by the US election time horizon.

“The phase three trial is expected to include up to 30,000 participants between the ages of 18 and 85 across 120 sites globally, including 39 U.S. states, the company has said. If it is successful, they expect to submit it for final regulatory review as early as October. They plan to supply up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and approximately 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.”

* PFE’s trials are reasonable and test subjects are well diversified.

[https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/12/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-plan-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trial/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/12/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-plan-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trial/)

* PFE’s vaccine trials have been advertised more than ever compared to all of its competitors. PFE, imo, is the most reputable firm for vaccines - unlike MRNA and GILD (and other biotechs) that produced vaccines only to be questioned profusely about their low-effort, shady testing methods.

**NCLH ops:**

* NCLH will start sailing again starting Oct 31 along with other cruises. Caveat: sailing might be pushed out to a later date due to the pandemic.

“Much of the cruise industry, including Royal, initially suspended sailings until mid-April only to extend it several times. Most cruise operators now say they don't expect to be sailing again until at least Oct. 31.“

[https://apple.news/ANG6R8Ys6Rci0gV-icYDo0w](https://apple.news/ANG6R8Ys6Rci0gV-icYDo0w)

* NCLH partnered up with RCL to strive towards a COVID-free cruising experience by establishing air-tight cleansing protocols.

[https://www.cruiseandferry.net/articles/healthy-sail-panel-provides-recommendations-to-us-cdc-1](https://www.cruiseandferry.net/articles/healthy-sail-panel-provides-recommendations-to-us-cdc-1)

* I chose NCHL over CCL and RCL because I believe RCL's price is slightly inflated and CCL seems to attract a lot of bad news compared to NCHL. Airlines seem to attract a lot of bad news as well. NCHL has the most optimal risk-reward imo.

**Sector Rotation:**

* Tech had its pump, and therefore, people wont easily jump into companies that are obviously inflated due to the election fears. However, the companies that are reasonably priced are the companies that are currently being fucked by COVID (airlines, cruise, malls, restaurants, casinos, etc.) as their historical data is fairly priced in. Institutional and retail investors alike will jump into any of these companies when they’re presented with good news; and hence, it’s likely that there will temporarily be an overreaction to the good news inflating these prices.

**Other Biotech’s Progress and Timeline:**

* AZN might be able to deliver vaccines as early as October if trials yield good results
* NVAX starts its Phase 3 in October
* MRNA might wait until end of the year to inform of vaccine effectiveness

**Positions and the Play:** Hold NCLH 15c 01/15/2021 for all of Oct (or at least until the vaccine news). $15 is a great strike because it acted as both the support and resistance for several weeks a few weeks back. If the vaccine news comes out, gauge the market carefully to find a good closing time. If there’s no vaccine pump, just close at the end of Oct. Assuming the price remains stagnant, it’ll only leave like 10%\~30% dent on your current position. You also have Nov 5 - NCLH earnings that would hedge against your long calls. The risk-reward is very worth it.

I've read reports of them not starting anytime soon so I am willing for it to be a long term investment. However, now that the chances of bankruptcy are higher, I'm unsure whether I am to sell or continue holding. I know people panic sell and that's bad but now that the financials for UAL n NCLH r that bad and UAL needs the government to bail them out, is it really panic or a justified sell?

What is the significance of this news? what i understand is that NCLH is obviously suffering financially. Would selling that much stock and notes from the company's side would dilute the stock price?

I'm curious as to what y'all think about these two? Between them I have roughly $1k invested and I'm down  $267 or so. Should I sell at a loss and try and recoup my money elsewhere or should I hold and see what happens when sailing resumes?

1) It breaks right through, in which case I would wait for a pullback and for the former supply level to hold as support to buy in;

2) It bounces off strongly, the way it did back in March and April. In that case I would wait for a pullback into the former consolidation area around 12-14 to buy in;

3) It pauses or bounces off weakly, and then breaks through.  A pause or weak bounce off the supply zone would make an excellent entry point.",2020-06-04,11,11

THAT BEING SAID,

1.much lower volatility pre virus than its competitor RCL making it more of a value stock for big money to dip into post world Re opening

2. When the world reopens I suspect at least a 10% stock spike for any cruize lines that have handled their financials in this crisis well.

3. It’s possible that many young people will want to get out of the house and take advantage of lower vacation prices in airlines, cruises ect. I know I will be booking a flight to LA as soon as airports open.

Lets be real - the virus has only gotten worse in the US since the first few cases in Washington, Illinois, and California. But now it's starting to spread more and LA ports, SF ports, and NY ports are all going to deny cruise docking to the point where people won't do a cruise to avoid this shit of a hassle + quarantine risk. Americans HATE feeling uncomfortableness / uncertainty and will decide to postpone cruises.

As it already is, these cruise ships are half full and people are canceling so it isn't unreasonable to believe that the people thinking ""oh its a great sale"" are going to stop thinking that once the actual government makes an official statement telling Americans to skip cruises and only do essential traveling for a few months to prevent beer virus spread. You could argue that the drop today in cruise stocks was the impact, but no way.. now that people will be told to stop going on them, they will listen and it should drop like 6-10% since the last of men going on cruises are now being taken away from cruise companies.

I bought CCL 26.5p 3/13s this morning. Seems like the fed Is trying really hard to keep these guys alive but clearly airline companies are more important so they are the ones who really have the fed's backs.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - the hopeful people who think cruises are 'on sale' right now are about to take some horse shit to their faces once they realize the government is going to discourage cruises. impact not fully realized yet. buy puts.

EDIT: people are saying IV is so high... so what? I bought CCL puts today not even at the peak and im up 20% on them. you'll make good money from the stock price drop. IV crush unlikely until coronavirus dies down ",2020-03-06,40,35
