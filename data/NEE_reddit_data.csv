1aw1e2m_NEE,NEE,$NEP & $NEE Legal Relationship,"I have been looking into NextEra Energy Partners $NEP, and it just struck me how strangely complicated their relationship to NextEra Energy $NEE is. NEP is managed by NEE, so far that both companies' CEOs are the same person, then that guy is also both of their chairman, while NEP is separately traded arm, span off of NEE. Then both NEE and NEP own some parts of the large company, but it's not very clear which parts ([https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/nextera\_energy\_partners/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&FilingId=16430034-49214-81592&CIK=0001603145&Index=11100](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/nextera_energy_partners/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&FilingId=16430034-49214-81592&CIK=0001603145&Index=11100))  So, I'm wondering to what extent can NEP help out NEE at the expense of shareholders - could they for example buy assets of nee that are not profitable, or for larger $ in case NEE is in trouble or could NEP management decide to sell themselves for lesser value than they are worth to NEE, to boost NEE profitability? 

To conclude my inquiry, I would like to point out the fact that IF YOU TOOK ALL OF NEP's PP&E AND SOLD OFF ENOUGH TO COVER ALL OF ITS LIABILITIES, YOU WOULD STILL HAVE 2x ITS CURRENT MARKET CAP WORTH OF PP&E LEFT. (not counting any other assets). WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? ",2024-02-21,15,7

What's the appeal with NEE if it's earnings have been declining?

Why does it get away with a 65 PE?

I.mean it is a steady stock with low volatility for the most part, but what's the appeal?

Why does it have such a high PE and have a 133% return the last 5 years and a 15% CAGR return for over 20 years?

It's also the heaviest weighting (about 15%) of XLU.

Also what would be the case for investing in a utilities index when it doesn't outperform the market as far as I can tell?

NEE HAS outperformed the market though.

Would there be a case to be made for investing in something that DOESN'T beat the market? Perhaps low volatility and security? Risk trade off?
 
For example JNJ typically does not outperform the market, but is a steady stock that also doesn't fall as much during volatile times, etc? So people with large amounts of cash would use JNJ as a sort of ""safe"" place to store cash instead of risking a short term large loss in the market?

Renewable energy has gained popularity amid a rising Green Movement. Currently, the leading source of global energy comes from oil, coal, natural gas, and hydroelectricity. The United Nations Summit on Climate and Environment has stressed the importance of carbon neutrality and many countries have taken the pledge to reduce carbon emissions. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is dedicated to expanding the U.S electric grid.

**Behind the Company**

NextEra Energy (NEE) is the largest utility company in the U.S based out of Juno Beach, Florida. The main goal of the company is to work towards renewable, emission-free energy. NEE sells energy to third parties sourced from its wind, solar, and natural gas farms. NextEraEnergy’s goal is to increase dividends by building utilities and expanding assets. 

**Macro Market View**

In December 2020, The United Nations held a global summit on climate and environment. The UN stressed the importance of reaching carbon neutrality as global temperatures increase. This is easier said than done. At the heart of CO2 emissions are oil and coal. Third-world countries that don’t have access to clean energy are unable to pledge to carbon neutrality. Oil prices have hit a three-year high. This is due to the global supply chain bottleneck. The increase in oil prices has shifted consumer demand towards cleaner energy, specifically natural gas. On top of that, the U.S is in the process of passing The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill which plans to invest $73B into electric grids. This will allow more access to clean energy in the U.S.

**Competitors**

* National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)
* Elia (ELI)

**Bullish Case**

* Climate and Environment Summit stresses carbon neutrality
* Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill dedicating $73B to expand electric grid
* Green Movement

**Bearish Case**

* Short Term Volatility
* Renewable Energy is inaccessible to developing countries
* Fear of oversupply of energy

**Management** 

* James L. Robo - Chairman and CEO (NextEra Energy)
   * Joined the company in March 2002 as Vice President of Corporate Development
   * Named president and CEO in July 2012 and chairman in December 2013
   * Has worked in energy for most of his professional career.
   * Graduated from Harvard College in 1984 where he was a Baker Scholar recipient.
   * Also the Director of J.B. Hunt Transport Services

**Conclusion**

NextEra Energy (NEE) is well-positioned within the energy industry. Macroeconomic factors such as the United Nations Summit on Climate and Environment, the U.S Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, and Green Movement are spurring the race for clean energy. However, Wind and solar power production are limited to environmental changes and are less reliable than fossil fuels. The lack of current infrastructure makes accessibility to renewable energy hard. That being said, the U.S is taking the right steps to make renewable energy more accessible. NEE is aiming to increase dividends by 10% year after year in what we believe to be an effort to retain long-term investors. COVID-19 has put a halt to increasing dividends. We believe that NEE used the $1.25B tax bailout to sustain dividends during this past fiscal loss of $350 million. Overall, NextEra Energy is a healthy company with a strong long-term outlook.

nm8nje_NEE,NEE,NEE/PRQ - Does anyone own these?,"I was looking at NextEra Energy and stumbled upon these ""corporate units"".

While NEE yields about a 2% dividend, these corporate units are paying 6.2%.

But the catch is that they convert into shares of NEE stock.

If I'm reading this right, 1 PRQ gets somewhere between .67 and .54 of a share of NEE by 9/1/23.

Seems to make sense since PRQ is selling at 48.50 and NEE is at $74.0.

So I get 6.2% for about 2 years, and either sell PRQ before 9-1-23 or let it convert in NEE common shares.

Anyone else looking at this? Am I analyzing this correct?

(I've never invested in something like this before).

Thanks

 

*6.219% Corporate Units*

In September 2020, NEE sold $2.0 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series L Debenture due September 1, 2025, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2023 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of October 27, 2020, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.6764 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to the reference price to 0.5412 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than the threshold appreciation price.The applicable market value will be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending August 29, 2023 and will also be adjusted (when determined) to give effect to the Stock Split and certain other anti-dilution adjustments to determine which settlement rate will apply.",2021-05-27,3,7

They reported Q4 2020 adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, which beat the consensus estimate of 39 cents by 2.6%. The bottom line was also up 11.1% from 36 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. This year-over-year improvement was owing to the company’s proper execution of its growth plans as well as the expansion of its customer base. NextEra Energy’s operating revenues were $4.395 billion missing the analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion by 11%. Their next earnings report is scheduled for Apr 27, 2021.

The stock currently sits at $78.24 per share. Analysts from UBS target a price of $95.00 per share in the next 12 months with a BUY position. Analysts at Wells Fargo also have a BUY position for NextEra Energy with a price target of $100.00 per share. Out of 10 analysts, 8 have given it a BUY rating and 2 a HOLD rating. Based on analysts' ratings, the forecasted average price of NextEra Energy's stock in the next 12 months is $138.71, an increase of more than 75%. The lowest rating given by analysts is $66 while the highest rating is $299.",2021-04-24,13,0

mp5qa1_NEE,NEE,Resubmitting my NEE DD with hopefully better formatting.," Before continuing I feel like I should make clear that I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy. 

NextEra Energy Inc (ticker symbol NYSE: NEE) is the world largest utility company and is composed of three subsidies, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Gulf Energies, and NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which, combined with its affiliated entities, is the worlds largest green energy supplier/generator or solar and wind energy, well earning it the title of Supermajor. Traditionally the title of Supermajor is reserved for the largest players in the oil and gas industries since those companies control the energy that powers modern civilization, oil. However due the recent drop in cost to build and maintain renewable energy generation along with a larger than anticipated federal backing, renewables have lead to a new wave of energy Supermajors rolling in, and NextEra is leading the charge. Not just in the US, but globally as well. In this DD I am going to attempt to go over some basic financial information as well as some upcoming and past events that I see as growth opportunities and how those all pertain to NEE’s potential to be a long term dividend growth company that I feel deserves a spot in any investors portfolio if their time horizon is 30 years plus like mine is with my Roth IRA. (I am currently 23, so I can’t touch my tax free earnings for another 36 years, but that’s okay because I’m that time I’m expecting an avalanche of snowballs to occur if I’m successful in picking my portfolio.)

NEE pays a dividend traditionally in the months of March, June, September, and December. NEE stock is operating with a current share price of $77.94 and a current dividend FY 2021 dividend payment of $1.55 with a yield of 1.98%, down from their 4 year average of 2.78% which is itself down from the Utility Sector average of 3.24% suggesting it still has room to grow its dividend as NEE continues to lead the world in green energy generation. This current yield represents an \~10.71% increase from last fiscal years dividend of $1.40. Looking into FY2022 it is expected that the payout will again increase, this time to $1.71 representing another \~10.71% increase YoY.  And while NEE themselves have only offered guidance through 2022, Morningstar Analysts have gone a bit further, and predict NEE to raise its dividend by >10% each year through 2024. While this may seem like a bullish prediction it is important to know that NEE has been increasing its dividend for the last 27 years and has raised its dividend an average of 9.6% each year since 2005 and in the last 5 years alone, it has grown its dividend by over 12.5%. Finally, NEE only has a dividend payout ratio of 61.31%, which explains its dividend safety score of 99 and why analysis expect this dividend to continue to grow. Thanks in part to its share price appreciation but mostly it’s growing dividend, NEE has been able to provide a total return to shareholders of 700% over the last 10 years while the S&P 500 only returned 267% or less than half that of NEE.

Moving away from the dividend financials and looking more broadly at the companies overall holdings one ratio that sticks out to me is the Debt/Equity ratio of 1.32 which suggests that they are financing some of their expansion/growth and expenses by taking on debt. While this might seem like a bad thing, companies, especially utility companies focusing on green and renewable energy, are expected to leverage their debt and take on more debt to expand during this early developmental stage for the industry as a whole. Additionally when compared to its US competitors of Duke Energy ($DUK) and Southern Company ($SO), then NEE actually has a lower D/E ratio since both of them have a ratio of 1.34 and 1.84 respectively. The next question that might naturally come to mind then is “Well if they have a lower D/E ratio does that mean they are growing slower than the other two companies mentioned?” While that is a great concern to have but one that is ultimately not needed. The reason for this is because NextEra has been investing into green and renewable energy for so long and so aggressively that its is now able to funnel some of the profits it is starting to see from those initial investments into growing itself and expanding, thus reducing its need to grab more debt. 

A perfect example of this occurred in 2018 when NextEra Energy Resources finalized a massive deal that saw them acquire 11 new and under construction solar and wind farms that are now starting to become profitable as they were essentially being used to pay for them selves during the first three years NEE owned them per the terms of the contract (it was a 3 year payment period). Luckily time tends to move forward rather predictably and now, 3 years later in 2021 NEE is able to start using the profits from the approximately 1,388 MW (1MW is enough to power 400-900 average American homes for a year) generated from those facilities to finance itself rather than pay for the purchase of those facilities. One such project they are financing is their ‘30-by-30’ plan, where they intend to install at least 30 million active and generating solar panels in Florida alone by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that they believe they can accomplish and when you realize that there are only just over 2 millions solar panels actively in use across all of America, anyone can see the potential upside that being the one to supply all those panels and the energy they generate might bring.  This is an approximate 15X the current number of solar panels in the country, only they expect them to be all in a single state. It’s worth noting that this isn’t even NEE’s only future oriented project, but rather just one that highlights the growth potential NEE has in the long run.  

Another important metric to consider when looking at a company from a dividend growth perspective, is its cash flow. As one might expect from a dividend aristocrat, NEE is cash flow positive and has been increasing its cash flow YoY consistently (while paying down large amounts of debt left and right such as in 2020 when they paid off all their short term debt for that year as well as an additional $5 billion in long term debt) with the exception of 2018 which as previously discussed was a year of large growth and spending, and 2020 which was a global pandemic and even then, NEE was more even with 2019’s cash flow and didn’t really lose any; NEE was cash flow positive for both 2020 and 2018 despite the increased spending or macroeconomic hardships and raised its dividend during each as well. Another thing to note is that it has relatively maintained its operating income proportionally over the years ($4-$5 billion/year) even as its new projects come online and are intergraded into its network. This shows it’s still growing and maintaining it’s expected level of operations at its older sites. 

Another import financial element involved in long term dividend growth investing is a companies Price/Book ratio value. In this case NEE has a P/B ratio of 4.18, significantly higher than the Utility Sectors average of 2.66 currently. I believe there is an explanation for this however, and it has to do with NEE’s heavy investments (spending a lot of money years ago before it was even close to profitable) into renewables and green energy over the years that has caused this higher number. When you compare NEE to Ørsted ($DNNGY), which has a P/B ratio of 4.56 and has been investing into green and renewable energy almost as aggressively and as long as NEE and you can see how the larger renewable utility sector that is focused on growth is trading at a higher P/B ratio than the rest of the Utility Sector in general. 

The final financial metric I am interested in when looking at a dividend growth stock is its P/E ratio, and this is where NEE’s main critique comes into play. NEE’s current P/E ratio is 53, a  bit higher than the industry average of 28 (as of 2019, and 23 as of 2020 when looking at only electric companies) and the average range of 15-25 that its closest US competitors currently occupy. Personally I believe two things can happen because of this higher than average P/E ratio. 

1) Investors eventually believe the stock price is over valued and as a result I believe that the price/share will fall as investors sell off to make a profit before it corrects to a lower P/E. 

\- If this is something you believe would happen but still want to invest for the long term growth than I believe a decent strategy might be to consider dollar cost averaging in until the price starts to trade sideway indicating it’s more or less bottomed out, and when it reaches that point you can buy a majority of your shares than. 

2) Investors don’t believe the stock price is overvalued long enough for NEE to increase its earnings, thus lowering the P/E ratio by making more money as more and more projects are completed and acquisitions start to provide income instead of being used to purely pay for themselves. 

\- Now if this happens to be what you believe to be true then I believe the best course of action would be to open a majority of your position in NEE now and then dollar cost average in as time goes on and taking advantage of any single red days or the market as a whole is down. 

Now personally I believe that a combination of both options will occur where the share price will fall \~14.28% from today’s price to the analysis’ low price target of $66 over the course of a year or so. At the same time however I also expect NEE to increase their earnings by a combination of increasing generation capacity and service area, as well as saving large amounts of money on the costs of harvesting, storing, and transporting solar and wind power which have dropped 70% since 2010 and are continuing to do so. I then expect the price to bounce back if it fell to much, or trade about flat if it corrected just right, around a P/E ratio more in line with its industry, around 15-25. As a result I’m personally planning to buy shares next time it’s time to add to my Utilities Sector in my Roth IRA and continue buying more shares as time goes on. 

The next segment of NextEra that I want to dive into are its upcoming projects, and while I’ve eluded to a few previously in this write up such as their ‘30-by-30’ plan, which actually includes another upcoming community solar project within it called SolarTogether that, when completed, will be the worlds largest solar network of its type. NEE also merged two of its main subsidiaries, Florida Power and Light with Gulf Energy at the start of 2021. 

NextEra Energies ‘30-by-30’ plan is a current project and ongoing investment that is already underway which will generate an additional estimated 10,000 MW/year to their network. Furthermore, within the ‘30-by-30’ plan is a project named SolarTogether, which is estimated to generate 15% of the ‘30-by-30” plans total output or 1,500 MW/year, is a solar community project that, when completed, will be the worlds largest community solar project. SolarTogether will allow customers to offset up to 100% of their electricity use with solar. SolarTogether also allows individuals to sign up to use excess solar energy produced by neighbors when an individual doesn’t have any solar panels on their roof and doesn’t want to pay to install them. This offers a cheaper and greener form of energy that would have been either wasted if the battery for that area was full already or just put into that battery for storage, allowing NEE to make more money off of of what is essentially excess power since it’s only the energy not needed by the original home that collected it. 

The final bit of acquisition/merger news that I feel is pertinent and deserves to be discussed is the merger of NEE’s subsidiaries FPL and Gulf Energy. Under the now single entity, NEE, will officially begin shifting its entire company to a entirely green energy focus. In 2021 it is closing its final coal powered plant and no longer using any coal generated energy while simultaneously pledging to no longer build any combined cycle gas plants and cancelling any ongoing construction on projects not yet completed. This is to keep in line with their company pledge to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2029 compared to NEE’s emissions in 2005. In addition, another aspect of NEE’s green energy pledge is to use the merged companies to work on and complete a planned 409 MW solar energy battery. When completed, it will be the world largest solar energy battery but it will still only be a part of NEE’s plan to increase total storage capacity by 1,200 MW by 2029 dramatically increasing their storage capabilities. 

NEE is a utility sector green and renewable energy focused energy provider that currently trades at $77.94, has an analysis target price range of $66 - $101, and an average price target of $87.50. Personally I see NEE’s share price falling no more than \~15% (hitting the analysis low PT of $66) as it’s revenue continues to rise resulting in a reduction to its current P/E ratio sometime this year. Once that happens I expect the price to bounce and return to its expected rate of return of close to 8-9% plus its dividend growth rate averaging 9-12% which could carry the stock back to the APT of $87.50 with occasional spikes and run ups close to $100 this year, and finally passing $100 in 2022.  As such I  planning on buying a few shares when I’m next able to invest and will continue to dollar cost average in regardless of the price as I view this as a truest safe long term 20+ year play that I can sit on and just watch snowball until I’m ready to retire in like 30 years. 

Once again, I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy but I will definitely be opening a position soon with plans to hold it the next 36 years.

GOOOOOOD  Friday, Retards!  Well, week   after Good Friday.  Whatever.   NrdRage  here with your weekly dose of   ""what weird ass company I've  never  before considered should I throw   money at this time?""  Today  we're  going to be looking at a company with a  150 billion dollar  market cap  (I know, I know, I usually shy people   away from companies  this  big)...that you've probably never even heard   of.  I give to you,  the  techgrowthboomer (?  I dunno, I guess it's a new  space) utility   company:  NextEra.  I dunno, sounds like a fucking   sporting goods   store to me.

&#x200B;

# A   fucking UTILITY  company?  Really? First you talk about a garbage  engine   maker you  trash the whole time before going long, and now you  bring   this Boomer  ass weaksauce here?

&#x200B;

Yes,   yes I  totally am.  You're  right, they are just a utility company,  which   means slow and steady  revenue streams, by and large.  But they've  got a   secret.  Well, 3:   Their CEO could steal your wife without even   trying,  and they also  happen to be the largest producer of clean energy   on the  entire  continent.  Which means they get all that sweet, sweet    unregulated  energy income.  Which also means they're afforded the    benefit of  trading like a growth stock to a certain extent.  Which also     means...oh shit, let's wait on that 3rd secret for a minute.  Added     bonus:  Even though almost every green energy stock from chargers to     producers to makers on the market has been getting gangraped the last     few weeks (they doin' my boys $BE and $CLNE dirty, man, but they're     fighters.  Stop asking, I'm still super bullish on them both...)

If     you live in the Southeast, you probably do business with these dudes    in  one way or another.  Who cares?  If you live in Duke Energy    territory,  you probably saw them roll up into Durham recently and try    and buy those  dudes out.  Big fucking deal.  They've got their fingers    in power  delivery just about everywhere, though.  With the exception   of  some  mid-Atlantic states and some areas in the Rocky Mountains,   they  stretch  from Texas to fucking those weird fucks in Prince Edward    Island.  Cue  the fucking cat memes, because none of this is    interesting.

&#x200B;

# Let's see how this turbine runs:

&#x200B;

These    guys are HUGE.   Like, that  ""massager"" your wife keeps in her    nightstand huge.  Depending on the  day, they're somewhere between 47-49    in the S&P 500, by far the  largest utility on Wall Street.  They    generate between 4 and 5  billion a quarter in revenue, and run at about  a   25% net margin.   They trade at an absolutely INSANE multiple  relative   to their peers  (about 30 compared to an average of maybe half  that for   everybody  else), so they seem really expensive at first  glance.   They're   looking at about 9% YOY growth for the next 3 years,  which is    staggeringly good for utilities, but not mind blowing as a  growth play.      As mentioned above, they get away with that valuation  because  their   positioning as a global leader in renewable energy  production  moves them   away from utility and towards growth.  There's  not an  executive in the   sector that will tell you anyone else is run  better  as a company,   though.   They've recently been on the prowl to  acquire  somebody -   anybody - in order to expand their reach and market   dominance.  Hasn't   happened yet, but with the way their stock is   valued relative to their   competitors, it's only a matter of time   before they make an M&A or   two in all-stock deals.  Their   financial house is in order, and their   overall debt load is   respectable for their market.

The     great thing about $NEE is that, not only are they ahead of the curve    in  every way in transitioning from coal to other forms of energy, but    the  costs for these technologies continue to drop, meaning that  their    margins are going to improve dramatically going forward - which  is why    they can sustain the premium valuation.

# But let's get to the good stuff.  Shout-out to [/u/AllDatDalton](https://www.reddit.com/u/AllDatDalton/)     for bird dogging a lot of this information from his loft in a barn  he    rents from a kindly old man who's too tired to mince words.  Go  give   him  a like and a subscribe or whatever the fuck you kids beg for  all   day  these days.

&#x200B;

A  lot of you   idiots routinely  admit your shame in being bagholders hoping  that $ICLN   or $INRG will  do something other than fart when you poke  them with a   stick.  The  reason why these ETFs never do shit is because  the SPDJI   index only  has 30 stonks in it, and fucking $PLUG is the $AAPL  of the   clean  energy world according to it in terms of its weighting.   Which   means  if you bought in when $PLUG was rangebound from 65-70  earlier   this  year, you didn't make any tendies, and then you lost your  ass when    people got tired of $PLUG's bitch ass (Disclaimer:  I'm long  plug and    will be a bagholder until May when my calls expire worthless.     Fucking  $PLUG.  Don't buy that stock, and not just because they suck.  They're the anti-thesis of this entire ""Blackrock buying"" DD).

&#x200B;

Well,  that's   about to  change.  The number of stonks going into this is going  to   jump from 30  to....100.  At least.  Dalton (hmmm, I thought he'd be    bigger) has been  calling this the ""Blackrockageddon"", and you should    absolutely go read  his series of DD's on this topic.  I won't quote the    entire thing, but  the TL:DR is this:

&#x200B;

* On April 19th, this index gets rebalanced hardcore
* Whatever     gets added to the index, Blackrock (which, if you didn't know, is  the    Brad Wesley of the fucking investing world and the size of a mid   sized   country in terms of its assets) will be buying the ever-loving   shit out   of what's in there, because that's what they do.
* Therefore,     anything that gets added is going to get injected with a concoction   of   speed, cocaine, and some leftover Surge cola from 1998.
* This     index is going to be taking a sampling from best in breed and    influence  from a number of different sectors within the clean energy    metaverse.   Energy production, energy storage, smart grids, alternative    fuel for  vroom vrooms.  Think back now, children:  Who did I say was    the biggest  producer of renewable energy in North America?  Think   maybe  that company  might get added to a Dow tracked list?  Think   maybe, as  BY FAR the  biggest company in the entire fucking sector,   that company  might have a  disproportionately huge weighting in the   index?   If you  don't, you  might be the bad kind of retarded.  I'm   telling you this  because Dalton  has a philosophy to always ""be nice""   and he won't say  it.
* This is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.  95%, easy.

# 

# How much will Blackrock buy?

Dalton's     friend Wade says 400 million.  And he was wearing a manbun before it     was not cool, so you know you can trust him.  Actually, he had the   only   manbun in history that wasn't uncool.   My projections (this is   an   interesting thing, because he and I got interested in this shift at     about the same time) are slightly more aggressive, and I'm in the     480-520 range.  That's a lot of 1964 Buick Rivieras no matter who's     right.  These kinds of buys represent...oh jesus, almost 30 days of     volume for this company?  When you're talking this much money, you're     talking the back channels chosen retards like me use to buy our mass     quantities to consume (oddly, ThinkorSwim and JPM reserve just don't     have that much laying around), so you won't physically see it in the     order books, but you'll see an unexplainable melt-up.  Except that I     just explained it.  So there's that.

# Technical analysis, aka Man's search for faith, that sort of shit

I'm     going to do things a little differently this time because what I'm     DD'ing is really more of a momentum trade than a ""this company goin'  to    the moon, lads"" type of trade.   Instead I'm just going to show  one chart that explains   why the  hell these guys are so different from  every other utility out   there,  because I think that's all I need,  and then a quick 3 month daily.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

* Big     ass utility about to get added to the world's biggest clean energy   ETF  -  and, in fact, is likely to be the most heavily weighted stock in    that  index
* Has consistently outperformed everybody else in their sector for basically forever
* Is one of the rarer types of stock that isn't presently trading at or near it's ATH, so it's got some room to run organically
* Maybe you fucking $ICLN cucks who have been bagholding that shit ETF forever can finally break even now
* Even     if the momentum trade goes sideways, there's very low risk of   existing   tendies.  Your upside is significant, and your downside if   everything   goes as wrong as it possibly can is fairly minimal
* You     can still convince yourself as you cry in the shower about how old     you're getting that you're not REALLY old because you aren't buying a     utility company, but a Techility company, and everybody knows fusion  is    the best kind of food.
* Look     at it this way:  WHen you finally realize you ARE old and move to     Florida, owning shares of this is like getting a rebate on your     electricity bill
* I     didn't talk about it, but they recently had a 4:1 stock split, and     those usually provide some runway as people interpret the stock as     ""cheaper"".
* I     don't remember Patrick Swayze ever talking with funny accents except    in  To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, so Dalton might    have  gone to drag.

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'll     be straight:  Normally I would say it's priced pretty fairly right    now.   If not for the index shakeup, this would not have been my DD.    I've got  some short plays I'd like to talk about at some point because    the  market is going to turn to shit in May (and let me just apologize    for  not making a $DASH short DD a month ago, cause hoo-boy has that    been a  great play - hopefully some of y'all caught me talking about  it   in the  dailies).  I mean, more shit than it is right now.  As it    stands, I  think a short term target of 83 is really likely.  I've seen    long term  price targets of up to $113, but I just don't see it.  I    think $87 would  be where I'd start questioning you if you didn't take    profits.  And  remember, this entire thesis is based upon Blackrock    giving it a boost,  plus the added exposure that comes with being added    to a Dow index.  The  thesis all changes if that turns out to not    happen.

# How to play it (There's always barber college if you fuck this up):

This     is a momentum play where you're just now starting to see the wind up    of  momentum (AKA ""How long you gonna be in town?  Not very long"").      Usually you'd see me advocate for some 90-120 day leaps 20% out of  the    money because usually what I talk about are mid caps with a lot  of    volatility that can flip your whole world upside down on not a lot  of    news because I like a bit of pod racing, but this trade should  resolve    itself much more quickly.  Buy some May 21 80c's ($1.50 at  the time of    this writing) and run like a thief if you want just a  little taste of    adrenaline.  If you want to play super safe, let the  underlying equity    come in a buck to the red and then buy $2 in the  money.  If you've  got   one of those working stiff retarrrrment  accounts, go into your  401k and   buy some shares.  If you want to be  ballsy about it all, grab  some   September 17 85c's for 2 bucks and  roll the dice.  The IV is  going to be   at a minimum because, even  though this thing trades at a  tech  multiple,  the IV is reminiscent of  the utility sector it lives  in.

**Commentary   that will age like milk:**    On the day of this writing, $NEE is slightly   green on yet another   no-volume largely red day where 10 stocks are   somehow making the SPY   green but most anything you'll track is red.    It'll probably fade into   red.  You might save a couple pennies.

# Position Disclaimers:

I'm     actually not going to tell you how many shares I have because it    sounds  like a ton (and, to be fair, it is) and I don't want to give off    the  impression that I'm YOLO'ing my life savings on this when the   fact  of  the matter is my managed portfolios basically is a mid sized   hedge  fund  and boring ass companies like this make up a pretty good   chunk of  that.  Fun money,  I've got 300 5/21 80c's, that I bought in   February on a hunch  about  re-balancing, and 500 6/18 75c's/ 500 6/18   77.5c (have been  building  that position since early March, so these   were OTM when I got  them).   These options, because they're so cheap,   really don't represent  a  significant holding even in my fun account   and my means of playing  this  trade is mostly via shares.

If     you're trying to shadow trade me, I don't know that the 6/18     75's/77.5's are the right choice because they're currently sitting at     about 4.60, but I only paid 1.47 for them so they made more sense for  me    than they will you.  That said, if you're risk averse, there's a    reason  why I chose June and I chose 75 when I started opening my    position.

# PS:

Because     a lot of people have been asking me, as I've done DD's on a number  of    clean energy stonks:  While I think that $BE DESERVES a place in  an    index like this just because the type of clean energy they do is  so    damned unique and not represented by anybody else that is a likely  add    (nobody else getting added to this makes fucking microgrids), I   wouldn't   bet any money on it getting a spot in there.  I'll be   pleasantly   surprised if it does, but I'd put the odds of that at 20%.

HOWEVER,     since this index is tracking clean energy FUELS on top of clean   energy   generation, my boy $CLNE wants his shot at the title, and I   wouldn't  be  the least bit surprised if he gets a ticket to The Show.    Plus, I  mean  it's CALLED the Clean Energy ETF.  You can't spell Clean   Energy  ETF  without Clean Energy.

So what's NextEra Energy? Summarized from Wikipedia:

* It is the largest electric utility in the USA by market capitalization. (At 160B currently)
* Revenues of over $19.20 billion in 2019. Operating income of $5.35 billion in 2019.
* About 14,000 employees throughout the US and Canada.
* The important subsidiaries include
   * The Utilities;
      * Florida Power & Light (FPL) - A Florida electric utility. Notable for having wider profit margins than usual.
      * Gulf Power Company - Electric utility in the Alabama area
   * NextEra Energy Capital Holdings (NEECH)
      * NextEra  Energy Resources (NEER) - The largest operators of wind and solar  projects in the world. Importantly, expansive holdings in the Midwest.  Also has numerous energy storage projects under their belt.
* They also have a 35% stake in NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) with Jim Robo being the CEO of both companies.

[In  fact, I'll just direct you to NextEra's IR page, because for some  reason they've placed a very solid series of pages outlining their  financial health where almost nobody will find them.](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/fixed-income-investors/financial-policy) You can flip  through the Policy, Strength, Funding/Capital Structure, Cash  Flow/Leverage, and Liquidity pages there at your leisure to understand  more about the company. But basically, they're extremely healthy as a  company. Notably, they've been [unwinding positions for cash](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/11-02-2020-222338600) recently despite their solid balance sheet.

Now,  I'd like to point out their P/E: 41. Yup, this is a ""boring"" utility company trading at 41x P/E after running up 200% in 5 years and 80% in  2. For reference, Microsoft is trading at 34.90 P/E. As far as utilities  go, I think it's fair to say these guys are as far from boring as it  gets.

Summary of the fundamentals;

1. Management is extremely reliable
2. They're the market leader in renewables deployment
3. They've proven they know how to compete and edge out profits in cutthroat industries
4. High P/E, but in a stable industry
5. They have plenty of leverage available for massive capital expenditures

Now  onto why I think they will collect more than their fair share of  Biden's upcoming stimulus. Let's start off by looking at what Biden has  been pushing in his announcements;

1. Pushing the environmental costs onto polluters
2. Pushing renewables directly
3. Creating long-term middle class union jobs

Among utilities, [NextEra stands out as an early and consistent investor in renewables](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-11-2020-173514490). Straight from the link above:

>According  to S&P Global Trucost, NextEra Energy ranked ahead of its peers on a  number of impressive reported performance metrics, among others,  including signed contracts to build approximately 12,000 megawatts of  additional wind, solar and battery storage projects as of the close of  2019, and NextEra Energy's announced target of emissions reductions per  unit of generation by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, equivalent, to a  40% reduction in absolute emissions – and this, despite an expected  doubling of generation over the period. Already, NextEra Energy reports  more than 50% of its generation is from zero- and near-zero-emitting  sources.

I think it's fair to say that point 1 will hurt them much less than it will their less progressive competition.

Additionally,  as a result of their investments so far, they're not untested when it  comes to deployment: They know what to expect and we know they can  execute on larger CapEx programs with less risk than the competition. If  Biden is to throw the expected 40 billion a year into the industry,  it's quite likely NextEra will be ready to scale up operations  sustainably and successfully to capitalize on the opportunity, clearing  point two.

But point three is the  really interesting one. Let me start off with a question; If you were a  democratic president that wanted to create middle-class jobs in  renewables, how would you go about it? Would you invest in the companies  making the end product? Maybe a little for the companies that pull the  required resources out of the ground too?

[Let's  take a look at what the clean energy portion stimulus bill a few weeks  ago contained and see how NextEra is positioned for each portion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/khx7eb/stimulus_bill_includes_35_billion_for_clean/) Big thanks to [/u/millerlit](https://www.reddit.com/u/millerlit/) for summarizing. Also, [I'll be referencing the NextEra 2019 annual report from this point on](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/reports-and-filings/annual-reports). Please bring up a copy if you'd like to verify the numbers I claim.

* $1.5 Billion for Solar - Will probably go to most industry players pretty  equally, NextEra will get a cut as a result of their investing through NEER. 12% of NEER's generation is from solar power according to the 2019 annual report (p.13).
* $2.6 Billion for Transport - NextEra probably won't get much of this, but they have [made an acquisition](http://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/12-08-2020-123104618) in the field within the last month. It would be a nice perk if they  announced major projects here, but let's just leave this as a  hypothetical.
* $1.7 billion for a Weatherization Assistance Program - I'm not 100% sure how  they'll break this down, but up here in Canada they do these programs  as rebates through utility providers. [NextEra is almost definitely going to get a cut of this as far as I can see.](https://www.fpl.com/save/programs.html)
* $1.08 billion for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy  storage technologies - NextEra is pretty big in the battery storage  field. [I don't think they'll be the ones developing a new battery chemistry, but they're definitely a serious user.](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-energy-to-spend-1b-on-energy-storage-projects-in-2021)
* $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. -  They're going to get a serious cut of this for obvious reasons.
* $625  million for new research, development and commercialization for both  onshore and offshore wind technologies - 65% of NEER's renewables  generation is wind power according to the 2019 annual report. They're  going to get a nice cut here too.
* $850 million for geothermal technology development - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $1093 million for marine energy and hydropower tech - Nothing here will go to NextEra, as far as I'm aware.
* $500 million pot for industry and transportation looking to decarbonize - 0 stake in this race
* $6.2  billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies - FPL  is investing quite heavily here, as 74% of their generation back in 2019  was from Natural Gas (p.9). They're going to get a good portion of  this.
* $6.6  billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power  plants and the development of advanced reactors - FPL generated 22% of  their power from Nuclear in 2019 (p.9). They're probably going to get a  fair slice of this.
* $4.7 billion for fusion industry - NextEra isn't spending money on fusion development, as far as I'm aware.
* Looser  regulations for using government land for renewables - A nice gesture  to drop land costs by increasing supply for sustainable uses. [Here's a map of US public land so you can take a look.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_federal_land.agencies.svg/1280px-US_federal_land.agencies.svg.png)

But you get the point by now - NextEra has a slice in a lot of these pies directly. On top of that, the renewables segment as a whole is going to hugely benefit from the stimulus driving down the capital expenditures required for panels and turbines. Frankly, there are very few people  better positioned than a well-run utility company with massive credit  available taking on the debt at great rates. When I put it like that, it's no surprise that these folks managed to thrive under Trump's policies - and that they're extremely well positioned to grow aggressively under Biden.

But there's even a fun political trap for the republicans here. Do you know  where the best place to place on-shore wind turbines is? [The midwest](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/itl/sed/gsg/mri50_2mph_inc_gumbel_v2.png) ([Source](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/maps-non-hurricane-non-tornadic-extreme-wind-speeds-contiguous-united-states)) - [A notable republican stronghold area](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=US+2020+election+results). NEER's own wind turbine deployment map in the annual report (p.13) backs up that their expansion is largely in that area.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Democrats quietly slated a lot of  the renewables spending into the midwest in an attempt to entrench a pro-union and pro-clean energy vote there - forcing the republican platform into a weird spot in future elections. It helps that that's pretty much the economical way to play it too.

To sum it up, I think NextEra's going to be a serious beneficiary of the renewables bill however it ends up going down, even if only because of their financial resources, deployment experience, and contracts with  suppliers. A big portion of this is that I don't believe the market has  priced in the amount they're collecting directly and indirectly because  the response so far seems to have been ""FAN/TAN/ICLN/QCLN goes brrrrr"".

Let's talk about the competition; The other US utility companies that were  listed as leaders in the clean energy transition by Global Platts are  Dominion Energy, Sempra Energy, and Xcel Energy. From one look at them  it seems like they're (1) much smaller and (2) at best half off on P/E  so I didn't really look at them too hard if I'm being honest.

Now for the bigger question; Do I grab NEE or \[clean energy ETF of choice\]?  Really, it's up to you. I think that the clean energy ETFs are trading  at downright idiotic valuations now. That, and I'd much rather bet on  one or two known strong performers that I believe in than I would on a  bunch of companies picked by someone else. That being said, those ETFs  have much more hype behind them, which is an important consideration in  this market.

Short-term catalysts  are basically the stimulus bill and earnings on the 26th. I expect some  big announcements on how they plan to capitalize on the bill during the  earnings call, and a huge bump in interest if they announce that they're  accelerating their renewables pipeline and focusing on that portion of  the company more.

Anyways, onto positions and how I'd trade it;

* If  you just want to buy and hold in an account for the extreme long-term  -> buy shares and hold, I think this is going to heavily outperform  the S&P 500 into the future.
* If  you want to get some of the spicy synthetic leverage gains with me  -> Jan 20 2023 80c's. They print if the stock goes up \~15% in the  next 2 years because IV is super low. I grabbed 10 at 12.10 at the start  of the week on the dip, but I think they'll open 13.00+ tomorrow. Keep  in mind that you don't need to hold till expiry, I'll probably liquidate  these after a year because I want the tax benefits.

https://preview.redd.it/okenftwkjh451.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f5c05962cb4e50917b88b412ec047ee7148aee

**Who Are NextEra?**

This is a trickier question than normal. If you search and try and invest in NextEra you'll see there are two companies with a similar name, and similar logo. They have a link but they are two independent firms.

NextEra Energy (NEE), who I want to talk about today, owns two electric companies. Florida Power & Light Company serves more than five million customers. This makes them the biggest regulated electric utility provider in the USA! Measured by retail only that is. The second company is Gulf Power Company which operates in eight counties, serving 460 thousand customers. Finally, NextEra Energy also is an energy company in its own right and is the largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun! As well as being in the battery storage game as well. 

Hopefully, like me, this has got your attention as to what they can become and how they can expand.

The other company, NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), is a partnership between itself and NextEra Energy. This separate company focuses on acquiring, managing, and owning clean energy projects and sites for the long term. This means that NextEra Energy can build a new site, get the technology and set up in place, secure a long term energy contract, then sell the whole project to NextEra Energy Partners for instant cash or to aid with cash flow. It does mean NextEra Energy Partners can also create partnerships on projects with multiple businesses and manage them separately from NextEra Energy directly.

While both companies you can invest in, depending on what kinds of exposures you like, I will focus in on NextEra Energy as that is where the R&D and energy generation are happening, rather than going through the partners' route.

**What Does NextEra Do?**

I should start by saying this ""clean energy"" company is not exclusively green. Gulf Power Company is not exclusively green. If we look at the different business lines when it comes to the revenue we get a clearer picture of what NextEra truly does. As this is the combination of multiple companies and different partnerships what they do runs a lot deeper than their company statement.

The last annual report doesn't include a clean here is where our money comes from across all our businesses, meaning we have to mash this data together ourselves to figure out what they truly do.

FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, some facilities can operate on both natural gas and oil, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix. This is the strategy here for making Florida Power more ""eco"".

NEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy, capacity, renewable energy credits (RECs) and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. They have a broader remit and get involved in infrastructure and transmission across the US. 

Gulf Power was finally acquired and moved over at the start of 2019. This isn't an eco company at all, and they are working to transition this business to move over to renewables.

As mentioned, this is the oddest ""renewable"" energy company I've come across, because they don't appear to be that renewable. It's a sprawling US-focused energy company with a heavy preference for renewable wind and solar, but that doesn't limit them.

In terms of how NextEra generates its power, you can expect it to come from a mix of solar, wind, natural gas, coal, nuclear, and oil. However, they have some additional revenue lines, as NextEra is in the business of selling the electricity they also have a trading division. Meaning they not only sell directly to end retail consumers (a few institutional contracts as well) but they also squeeze the margins but using a mix of buying in energy cheaply while also selling their excess. This level of operations is only possible with the scale of NextEra and their scope as an overall business.

**Does NextEra Make Money?**

Is this a profitable business, the energy sector can be tough, and anyone chasing the renewable energy industry, in particular, can end up being cash burning and supported only by grants and green bonds.

&#x200B;

Source: [Genuine Impact](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

A first glance comparing NextEra against the market doesn't look very promising. I want to know more than just a market comparison though, I want to see the actual numbers past and present. We know they have been acquiring new businesses, and they have a busy pipeline of reinvestment into their new sites, what does that mean for the profitability.

To start us off, NextEra generated $19.2bn in revenue in 2019, $4.6bn in the first quarter of 2020 as well. It's great to bring in money, but how are they converting this? Back to the annual statements for this. NextEra is running a gross margin of 58.33%, which represents a high cost of revenue. For the energy sector, and renewables especially, this is pretty strong, this isn't a number I expected to be above 30-40%. Recently I looked at a solar company who's gross margin was negative, so this is a relief. 

Energy companies also love to reinvest into R&D, and in this case, as we are selling directly to customers we can expect a higher than normal marketing budget. I was very impressed to see a very comfortable 19.63% profit margin. In 2018 this was 39.68% but we had less investment and financing activity that year.

So far this mutt of an energy company is showing the right signals, the next pitfall is the debt. With expensive sites and fixed long term contracts, the assets can be extremely high, which tends to encourage borrowing beyond their means.

For me, this is another tick mark. Even with $117.7bn in assets, the debt to assets is a comfortable 64.86%. Looking at the near term (back to quarterly statements!) The current liabilities are sitting at $13.7bn, but we have a problem. The current assets (cash, net receivables, and inventory) are only worth $9.7bn. Given the operational income for the most recent 2020 quarter was only $1.98bn we have a shortfall to think about.

The quarterly interest expense has shot up recently as NextEra takes on more financing. $1.3bn came out in Q1 2020, compared to $0.2bn in Q4 2019 and $0.7bn Q3 2019. While the long term picture isn't anything to panic about, this short term increasing debt while they are seeing the economy come under pressure is an unwelcome situation.

There is one last aspect of the financials I want to look into. How can I as an investor make money? Thankfully we have a dividend to look at. Due to the recent share price dive, and the darkening financial situation in the short term the dividend yield is a very weak 2.06%.

That 2% yield, however, represents a 73% payout ratio. Meaning if we can see increasing dividend growth and have confidence in the recovery, then there is a lot of long term love to be found here.

It's not often you come across a company with dividend growth for 24 years with no breaks. A quarterly dividend, with a strong track record, creates a lot of pressure on management to protect this for shareholders. The negative is this can cause short term decisions to create a booster quarter for shareholders and passing the issues onto the next quarter. 

The historic growth plus a fairly stable management team gives me the impression passing the buck onto the coming quarter is not something they do (commonly enough to be an issue at least!)

**Is NextEra Cheap To Buy?**

No. I don't think this will come as a surprise. For the most part, they have a solid balance sheet, they have a strong history, while the company is structured in a way that means you need six Bloomberg screens just to find a single revenue line, it's not new knowledge that NextEra exists and the market has been watching.

We have the classic COVID-19 dip we have seen across the market, however, the recovery hasn't been as strong as other companies even within the energy sector.

With the retail focus leaning heavily on their balance sheet, and Americans faced with a lot of economic issues in the immediate term, investors have reassessed the price a bit more cautiously.

Even now we can see a P/E ratio of 34.21x, price to sales of 6.46x, and a price to book of 3.45x. In the defence of NextEra, we do have a book to share ratio of 72.10x, however, this is not uncommon when you have assets that are functional sites that are bundled with long term energy contracts. 

Some other interesting facts which might explain why some investors have taken a moment to raise their eyebrows is internal ownership. Only 0.18% of the shares are held by directors and the institutional ownership sits at 81.04%. Remember that complex structure? NextEra Energy Partners owns the lions share here. 

NextEra Energy is selling a lot of directors sells recently but if you peek at  NextEra Energy Partners you'll see similar directors all buying. While the timings are off, and I expect some are locking in some profits, the heavy sell activity is only telling part of the story due to the company structure. That said this confusing relationship and setup will be offputting against other investments where ownership and responsibility is a bit more clear cut.

**What Does The Future Hold For NextEra?**

As my crystal ball has been broken for some time now, and I'm pretty sure it was defective anyway (thanks Beyond Meat) I'll have to depend on the far more educated professional sell-side analysts.

In terms of the future share price growth, the average prediction for the coming year is a $10\~ per share increase, a 3.23% increase. If you are a big-time momentum hunter there are much more volatile and high growth energy firms out there. The dividend will be causing a drag on the share price. The long term plan is the regular and reliable dividend payments than selling off at peaks.

The other aspect to consider is the revenue and EPS predictions, which are both pretty punchy for NextEra. Looking at the annual statements again, NextEra has a pretty rubbish record of beating expectations, they come very close but have trouble sealing the deal. 

With a poor track record of meeting analyst expectations and slow growth, is the dividend and green future enough to secure your interest?

According to the analysts, it should be! With 18 analysts keeping tabs on what is happening at NextEra (and no doubt fighting the company structure to come up with any conclusion) they are leaning towards a buy. Currently, we are in the overweight zone in terms of sentiment, which is an encouraging future if you are looking for a longer-term investment.

**NextEra Energy Executive Summary**

* A strong balance sheet with big revenues and excellent profitability
* Watch out for the short term this year debt, we might have some problems in the near term due to financing and COVID-19
* The dividend has grown for over 20 years, pays quarterly and over 70% of the income is being paid out
* This is expensive to buy right now as it's not an unknown stock and the short term debt means it might get cheaper short term
* Analysts are liking what they see, share price growth is barely beating inflation but the dividend is the crown jewel here
* Not strictly ""green energy"" but a bit part of their business, if you want pure renewables you'll have to skip NextEra for now
