1kl2f61_NEM,NEM,NEM - Newmont Gold,"This is a stock I fancy and I bring it to your attention. All the bears on this sub might like it. But there's reasons for bulls to like it too.

OK so currently pe around 11.5. Debt to asset 0.16. Some debt but nothing too much for a company it's size. 2% dividend.

They're huge. World's largest gold miner. Mines all over the earth. But they also mine copper. They produced 300 million pounds of copper last year. They have a **30 billion pounds** copper reserve. 

So for you bears: as chaos roams the planet and people seek safety the price of gold goes up. As the anticipated weakening of the dollar kicks in the price of gold goes up. And who's got the gold? **NEM**

But for you bulls say the global economy does just fine. Industry churns along great. So it needs lots of copper for all it's electronics right? So who's got lots of copper? **NEM**

And the financials are *sound*. ",2025-05-12,10,2

opqfux_NEM,NEM,NEWMONT - Is this a good long term buy? (Versus Barrick),"*Read to the end if you're interested in green energy*.

I want to expand my portfolio into the downstream of gold commodity and build sizeable dividends from it. Below is my DD, it has less to do with direct financials which seem sound, and more to do with mineral portfolios. Please jump in and discuss.

NEM vs. GOLD - NEM really is the evil empire. \*inside joke\* (because they really are the clear winner)

First off, my only consideration right now is finding decent underlying stocks that pay decent dividends with strong history of dividend growth.

**NEM -** Newmont has a 10Y CAGR growth rate of 10.41% on about a 3.64% forward dividend[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth)

**GOLD -** Barrick has a 10Y CAGR growth rate of -3.11% but stronger near term growth (though NEM is stronger even there). And a forward DIV of just 1.74%[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD/dividends/dividend-growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth)

So for dividends it seems like NEWMONT is winning.

For mining operations:

***Newmont mines Gold, Copper, Silver, Zinc and Lead.***

***Barrick mines Gold, Copper***

So Newmont's portfolio is superior.

**FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS**

A little understood tidbit for those who haven't been in the gold industry (I've had such a diversified childhood, father and grandfather owned 3 gold mines in Nevada,. I worked for a prospecting company that found over 2 million ounces of Gold during my tenure there when I was in college. blah blah blah).

Gold mines often run into ore deposits that are rich with Molybdenum, a leading orebody for Lithium.

Now ***HISTORICALLY*** Barrick and Newmont have been selling the ore to China for molybdenum processing so China gets the Lithium and then China ships back the ore to (in this case) Nevada for gold and copper processing.

Gold and copper tend to exist in the same ore bodies as well, Barrick tends to do open pit so are in the copper belt, Newmont goes deep and tends to get the higher sulfides that's where all the lead, silver and zinc live...

Anyway...the point is:

***I have not yet heard back from EITHER NEWMONT or BARRICK on what they intend to do with their lithium***.

I don't know if contractually they are still obligated to hand over the ore to China for lithium processing.

I've visited a molybdenum processing mill at one of the Nevada sites, so, the US does have the capability.

**THIS IS A FUTURE** consideration for those wanting to get into upstream green energy.

Barrick sold a major interest in a molybdenum joint-venture in Canada and I think that is a mistake and represents weakness.

**Conclusions**:

Gold is the driver for both these stocks and that is bearish right now, but I think both handle their reserves of Gold very well and so the companies can perform well in bear markets for Gold. I think though, both are uniquely positioned to expand upon molybdenum.

As mentioned above, Barrick seemed to make a strategic error in their selling of a joint venture. I don't understand the reason for it when moly is heating up.

I don't know what Newmont's stake in moly is exactly but their reserves of Gold/Copper suggests they probably have good access to this resource.",2021-07-23,1,12

NEM recently expressed that the   Symbol Opt-in launch date is  announced.  The opt-in opening date for   Symbol is September 15, 2020.

The   Opt-in date was on September 07, 2020; however, an additional 8  days   have been allotted for testing in order to improve the UI/UX.   There   are no new reported challenges as the testing seems to continue.

For   those who do not understand opt-in, it is the method by which the    existing XEM holders will be able to claim their XYM tokens at the    point of Snapshot, which will take place prior to the new chain launch    of Symbol, which is scheduled for December.

To   place the claim on XYM users should understand and accept the  terms   and conditions which is available on the website.  This is a part  of   the process of Opt-in.

Of note, the Opt-in web pages and terms and conditions will also be going live on September 15, 2020.

At   the point of snapshot, for those who do not opt in the XEM balance    that is there, will be allocated with an equivalent amount of XYM in to    the user’s wallet.  Thus, users will be able to Opt-in to their your    XYM tokens for nearly 6 years after the launch date providing further    details about how this might get shared in the near future.

Starting,   September 15, 2020 users will be able to Opt-in using the  NEM desktop   wallet and the NEM mobile wallet for Android versions only.  Notably,   the single accounts, which can consist of namespaces &  harvesting   keys; and Multi Signature accounts, which can consist of  namespaces  and  harvesting keys. Of note, they have also stated that the *Multi Signature account Opt-in could only be initiated in the NEM desktop wallet.*

>Sydney   Ifergan, the crypto expert,  tweeted:  “It is Snapshot and NEM Opt-in   time.  They state Binance have  not yet announced support. They also  say  that the only way to  absolutely receive XYM is to hold XEM in a  wallet  that is user  controlled.”

The best option for now is to store the funds in the NEM desktop wallet.

In the Reimagine 2020 v2.0 Workshop series, Laura Angel, Business  Development LATAM at [u/NEMofficial](https://www.reddit.com/u/NEMofficial/)   have provided a general overview  regarding the use cases about the  two  blockchains like NIS1 and Symbol.   The video is worth the watch by   those who are trying to understand NEM.

The   iOS is expected to be available on the Apple Store at a later  date  due  to the centralized approval process.  For now users are to log   into  their NEM wallet and follow the instructions for the Opt-in.

Whilst this was due on the 7th  September 2020, a further 8 days has  been allowed for testing and  improvement of the UI/UX. Testing is  ongoing but we do not foresee any  challenges at this point.

Opt-in  is the method by which existing XEM holders are able to claim  their XYM  tokens at the point of Snapshot, prior to the new chain launch  of  Symbol scheduled for December. It is important to understand and  accept  the terms and conditions that are copied on the website, and are  part  of the process to Opt-in.

**What can be opted-in and what can’t?**

From  the 15th September 2020 you will be able to Opt-in the following   through your NEM desktop wallet and NEM mobile wallet. (Android only)

* Single accounts (which can include namespaces & harvesting keys)
* Multi Signature accounts\* (which can include namespaces & harvesting keys)

\**Multi Signature account Opt-in can only be initiated in the NEM desktop wallet*

**What do I do next?**

You  will be able to Opt-in from the 15th September 2020 through your  NEM  Wallet, or from your NEM Mobile Wallet on your Android device.   Unfortunately, iOS is not available at this time, owing to the more   centralised approval process. Due to the time period it takes to publish   an application on the Apple Store, it will be available at a later   date. You can log into your NEM wallet, and follow the instructions to   Opt-in.

Further information will be available on the NEM platform [website 191](https://nemplatform.com/) on the date of Opt-in launch.

The   Opt-in date was on September 07, 2020; however, an additional 8 days   have been allotted for testing in order to improve the UI/UX.  There are   no new reported challenges as the testing seems to continue.

For   those who do not understand opt-in, it is the method by which the   existing XEM holders will be able to claim their XYM tokens at the point   of Snapshot, which will take place prior to the new chain launch of   Symbol, which is scheduled for December.

To  place the claim on XYM  users should understand and accept the terms  and conditions which is  available on the website.  This is a part of  the process of Opt-in.

Of note, the Opt-in web pages and terms and conditions will also be going live on September 15, 2020.

At   the point of snapshot, for those who do not opt in the XEM balance  that  is there, will be allocated with an equivalent amount of XYM in to  the  user’s wallet.  Thus, users will be able to Opt-in to their your  XYM  tokens for nearly 6 years after the launch date providing further   details about how this might get shared in the near future.

Starting,   September 15, 2020 users will be able to Opt-in using the NEM desktop   wallet and the NEM mobile wallet for Android versions only. Notably,  the  single accounts, which can consist of namespaces & harvesting  keys;  and Multi Signature accounts, which can consist of namespaces and   harvesting keys. Of note, they have also stated that the *Multi Signature account Opt-in could only be initiated in the NEM desktop wallet.*

>Sydney   Ifergan, the crypto expert, tweeted:  “It is Snapshot and NEM Opt-in   time.  They state Binance have not yet announced support. They also say   that the only way to absolutely receive XYM is to hold XEM in a wallet   that is user controlled.”

The best option for now is to store the funds in the NEM desktop wallet.

NEM Cryptocurrency Reimagine 2020 v2.0 Workshop Series

In  the Reimagine 2020 v2.0 Workshop series, Laura Angel, Business  Development LATAM at [u/NEMofficial](https://www.reddit.com/u/NEMofficial/)  have provided a general overview  regarding the use cases about the two  blockchains like NIS1 and Symbol.   The video is worth the watch by  those who are trying to understand NEM.

The   iOS is expected to be available on the Apple Store at a later date due   to the centralized approval process.  For now users are to log into   their NEM wallet and follow the instructions for the Opt-in.

igyhjn_NEM,NEM,Opt-in Launch Date Announced for NEM Based Symbol,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lapmnkfricj51.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=820fee10eed6eabe371d863bdfdfa8533f4594e8

Opt-in for NEM based Symbol has been  announced. The opt-in will be  starting from September 15th. Earlier,  the launch was scheduled for  September 7th, but it was decided to delay  the opt-in by another eight  days to allow for testing and UX/UI  improvement.

# Details of the Opt-in

Opt-in   is a technique that can be used by current XEM holders at the point of   Snapshot to claim XYM tokens they have. This is the method in place   prior to Symbol’s scheduled new chain launch in December.

However,   it is necessary to comprehend and accept all the terms and conditions   mentioned on the website. These terms and conditions are also part of   the opt-in process. These terms and conditions and the opt-in website   pages will be going live on September 15th.

# XEM Balance and Tokens

It   is worth mentioning here that at the point of Snapshot, XYM equivalent   of your XEM balance will get allocated into your wallet. In addition,   holders will be allowed to opt-in and claim their XYM tokens for a   maximum of six years after the launch, and exact details of how this can   be done will be shared in some time.

# What you can opt-in?

Using NEM desktop and mobile wallet it will be possible to opt-in from September 15th into the following:

1. Single accounts that can include harvesting keys and namespaces.
2. Multi-signature   accounts that can include harvesting keys and namespaces. But iOS will   not be available at the moment due to its centralized approval   procedure.

i2y0fv_O,O,Timestamp and IP Solutions Upcoming as NEM Ventures Announces Investment in SharpShark,"NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investment arm of the NEM blockchain ecosystem, has made a strategic investment in [SharpShark,](https://sharpshark.io/)   a blockchain-powered timestamping solution that protects creators’   copyrights, while enabling the transfer and tokenization of intellectual   property, and the auto-monitoring of violations.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cy0h68c0qse51.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea69ce226cd037896735c83e1b0e9ff6cf49488

 

Commenting on the investment, **Kailin O’Donnell, Co-Founder and General Partner at NEM Ventures**:   “Existing timestamping solutions have fallen short and copyright   deposits are extremely costly. SharpShark’s digital timestamping service   records artwork, aiming to protect creators’ moral rights to their  work  by detecting plagiarism and copyright infringement. We believe  that all  makers should have full control over their creations, and are  aligned  with SharpShark’s mission to create a fair and equitable  solution for  protecting intellectual property.”

Built on [Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/) by   NEM, SharpShark provides a decentralized solution to protect text and   image copyrights — by timestamping, saving in full, and tokenizing   intellectual property. SharpShark is designed for creators ranging from   writers, academics and journalists to photographers, artists and   designers.The solution publishes the digital signature of the text and   images to the Symbol blockchain alongside the author details to prove   authorship, always according to GDPR policy. The data is then stored in   immutable form.

SharpShark has a  suite of potential use  cases spanning media, academia and  user-generated content platforms.  Writers and journalists can detect  plagiarism, prevent copyright  violations and generate a portfolio of  their intellectual property. This  enables media outlets to monetize  content by combining anti-plagiarism  detection and timestamping into  one unified solution. Further, academics  have the ability to eliminate  academic misconduct and establish a  priority of findings. Additionally,  creatives such as photographers,  artists, designers can utilize  SharpShark to prove authorship and  effectively track their creations in  one consolidated space.

As the  venture capital and investments arm of the NEM blockchain  ecosystem,  NEM Ventures promotes the growth of NEM technology through  strategic  investment in meaningful, high-tech projects. Symbol, a  performant,  scalable and feature-rich protocol upgrade of NEM’s  enterprise  blockchain, is due to launch later this year.

Symbol  connects businesses,  developers, and individuals, enabling various  possibilities for  blockchain. Symbols reduce costs and complexity in  existing processes,  and provide a platform for new business models and  innovation, bringing  together developers, projects and companies to  create mutual benefit  and shared value.

Unlike  its  predecessor NEM, Symbol is a blockchain technology built with a  concept  of a blockchain technology business platform that is friendly to   developers. So that all these conveniences will reduce costs,   complexity, and time-to-market.

In   addition, the symbol also offers a flexible and secure solution that   can be adjusted through simple features, with powerful built-in   features.

One  more Symbol also  provides options for access to the public and private  blockchain,  individually or together (Hybrid), so that it can provide  options that  best suit your company’s needs.

Can   you imagine right? What business can be built with all the  conveniences  of this Symbol? Yes all businesses can be integrated with  blockchain  through Symbol starting from Fintech, Gaming, Healthcare,  Supply Chain,  Real Estate, Education, Insurance, Government.

If   you really are a NEM fan like me, and save some $ XEM in a NEM wallet,   you will get $ XYM in the ratio of 1: 1 to the amount of $ XEM you  have.

I  suggest you participate  in taking the NEM project on your radar again,  which now looks a lot  like a sleeping giant, unless of course you want  to miss another strong  trend in crypto. The rise of the giant blockchain  starts here, so what  are you waiting for?

How long is the supply chain from the manufacturer to the end user? I think you can roughly understand that many products on the market have a very long chain before they fall into our hands. And at every stage there is a risk of fraud, substitution, and other unpleasant things that make the product worse for the end user and cause irreparable damage to the reputation of the manufacturer. Everyone knows about it, they fight as best they can, but the fakes have not gone away.

I know that blockchain projects have already tried to solve this problem, but have not really succeeded in this. Now the NEM team got down to business. With vast experience in this technology, they have developed a new Symbol blockchain capable of solving many business problems, including this one. The team has a name, knowledge of how to do it and certain connections. I think they will be successful. Symbol's main network launch is slated for the end of the year. 

More about the project.

hr0psq_NEM,NEM,NEM News Summary: Lithuanian LBCoin and the Kentucky Whiskey Fund,"This is a summary of the news regarding NEM that was released from July 5th to 11th, 2020.  
I think the big news this week is Lithuanian LBCoin and the Kentucky Whiskey Fund.  
Such news is likely to be a good founder for incorporating NEM into the enterprise field, and I feel that it may be possible to explain to companies and government agencies why NEM blockchain is handled.

Nem's new platform Symbol will greatly reduce super node rewards, but if the stake score is high, you will be able to receive a lot of inflation rewards, so rewards will not discourage node operation (it will increase in simulation, so rather should be motivated).

hl4kfw_NEM,NEM,Symbol and NEM are tools that provide solutions even to the most common problems.,"There's so many cryptocurrencies out there let's say Bitcoin because it amounts the value of gold for one. Still, one might choose to buy or support that currency merely because of (a) the value it brings you (b) the very idea of the currency which makes it really valuable.

But it is possible for me to support a currency because of its practicality to solve common problems we  usually encounter, and yes that is possible. I myself own NEM because of that reason and now they've created a new platform that compliments them which is called [Symbol](https://symbolplatform.com/) (XYM).

It's main purpose is to make it everything easier let's say if you use Symbol's aggregate transaction for the “troublesome” work of pre-collecting membership fees for company banquets (year-end party, new year party, welcome and farewell party, etc.) that the secretary performs, that burden will be reduced. 

It's simple enough for me tbh, if that provides actual solutions and is applicable then that is something worth backing up.",2020-07-04,1,2

Friends, all of us in the world of cryptocurrencies are very skeptical. Scammers try to deceive us all the time, projects often change the rules on the go, and exchanges are a continuous process of manipulation. However, we are still here, because among other things, there are projects that really work and make money. 

Today I suggest you take a look at a new product from the NEM project. This is the Symbol blockchain platform for businesses that want to optimize their processes and implement the blockchain in their business. There are several reasons why I believe the platform can be a success:

1. NEM is one of the most experienced projects in the crypto space. They have a wealth of experience and despite some setbacks, the project still remains in the Top.
2. Symbol is a platform with a friendly user interface. No consoles or codes, everything will be simple and clear.
3. Taking into account the latest world events, any business needs to be optimized. Managers understand this and will look for variations. Symbol will definitely be considered.

I suggest that you carefully monitor the project, and first read the information on the site. There are a lot of interesting things there, including the project roadmap.

But this campaign is only part of a huge strategic marketing plan for 2020. I would like to note that NEM is a fundamentally strong project that began to be developed before Ethereum. And you know what a strong project with good marketing can do. If you are interested, see the details below.
