1kon4ym_NET,NET,[HLT stock] Most of net worth in employee stock purchase program. Continue the course or diversify?,"
I have been putting 15% of my paycheck into the ESPP (employee stock purchase program), and have amassed almost 60k. The stock has been performing magnificently and I’m up 82% since I’ve started contributing in 2020. We can purchase the stock at a 15% discount based on the closing price at the beginning or end of the “purchase period,” which is six months.

HLT seems to be insulated fairly well as it operates on a franchise and service-based business model. Of course we’re affected by tarriffs and the current economic environment, but I’m still extremely bullish on the stock.

Should I continue to maximize my contribution and have that be my *main* receptacle of savings? I feel like it’s just *too good* of a deal right now. I do want to maximize my Roth but this just seems to be such a greater opportunity of return.

1kgep5w_PATH,PATH,Warren Buffett: Putting 75% Of Your Net Worth Into A ‘Lead-Pipe Cinch’,"Warren Buffett discussed in 2021 putting seventy five percent of his net worth into one position when you’re working with smaller sums. Here’s an excerpt from the meeting:

There have been times… well initially I had 70, several times I had 75% of my net worth in one situation.

There are situations you will see over a long period of time… I mean you will see things that it would be a mistake if you’re working with smaller sums, it would be a mistake not to have half your net worth in.

I mean you really do sometimes in securities see things that are lead pipe cinches and you’re not going to see them often, and they’re not going to be talking about them on television or anything of the sort, but there will be some extraordinary things happen in a lifetime where you can put 75% of your net worth or something like that in a given situation.

1k95m98_GOOGL,GOOGL,Dead Cat Bounce or Shift in Sentiment? SPY Net Options Sentiment Looking Bullish,"Been keeping an eye on SPY lately after all the chop this month, and I pulled up the Net Options Sentiment (NOS) chart to see if anything actually changed under the hood.



https://preview.redd.it/wr57921u3exe1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9bb19c902d946d0a86762f9126da6f11220c87d

Chart - [Prospero.AI](http://Prospero.AI)

Here’s what’s interesting:

* Early April was pure pain. NOS was basically flatlined near zero while SPY nuked below 500. Options flow was super bearish or just nonexistent.
* Around mid-April though, sentiment started turning up. First slow, then a pretty decent spike.
* By April 22, NOS ripped through the “Bull Line” (around 40) and actually stayed up there for a few days.
* SPY’s price action caught up too — it’s been grinding up toward 550–560 ever since.



On top of that, you’ve got:

* Trump pausing some of the new tariffs (at least for now)
* Tech earnings coming in strong (Google especially crushed)
* Market sort of trying to price in a soft landing again
* So basically, the sentiment + price combo is finally showing some real strength for the first time in weeks.
* But (and it’s a big but), could just be a classic dead cat bounce too. We’ve seen fakeouts before.



If NOS starts rolling over from here, probably back to Chop City.

If it stays elevated or keeps pushing higher? Could actually be the start of a bigger leg up.

I’m not full send bullish yet but definitely watching this pretty closely now.

Curious if anyone else is seeing the same thing, dead cat or shift in sentiment?",2025-04-27,186,150

1k7ciwr_NET,NET,Rule of 40? EBITDA or Net Income?,"So I’ve been using Rule of 40 lately mainly for tech and SaaS stocks and I’m still trying to figure out the best way to use it. For those unfamiliar, it’s pretty straightforward:

Revenue Growth % + Profit Margin % = Rule of 40 Score  
  
If it’s 40 or above, the company is supposed to be operating efficiently—scaling without burning through cash too recklessly.

Where I’m still torn is whether to use EBITDA margin or net income margin when doing the math.

EBITDA Pros:

* Strips out interest, taxes, and non-cash accounting stuff like depreciation
* Gives a cleaner look at how the core business is operating
* Probably a better fit for early-stage growth companies that are reinvesting heavily

Net Income Pros:

* Includes all costs, so it's more of a bottom-line reality check
* Shows how much actually ends up in shareholders’ pockets
* Maybe better for more mature companies?

I’m leaning toward EBITDA for tech and SaaS names since net income is often negative even for solid companies but I can see the argument for using net income if you’re looking at companies that are further along in their growth cycle.

I'm mostly watching growth names in the AI and digital infrastructure space, and here are some Rule of 40 scores (using EBITDA margins) I found recently:

* INOD (Innodata Inc.) – 135.6% growth + 12.94% margin = 148.54
* AMTM (Amentum Holdings) – 72.3% growth + 6.33% margin = 78.63
* APLD (Applied Digital) – 51.3% growth + 8.29% margin = 59.59
* GDS (GDS Holdings) – 17.7% growth + 40.89% margin = 58.59

  
They all clear the 40 mark, which has made me look at them a little differently.

Do you prefer EBITDA or net income for your margin input?

Does it depend on the stage of the company?

1jabigi_NET,NET,A Classic Net-Net Stock That’s Too Cheap to Ignore,"Hey everyone,

I just came across this **Net-Net stock**, and in my eyes, it looks heavily undervalued

The company is Cronos Group (CRON), a Canadian cannabis company trading at a **huge discount to its liquidation value**:

* **Trading at 0.68x book value**
* **Cash ($858M) exceeds market cap ($724M)**
* **Revenue growing at 37.7% CAGR over the last five years**
* **Zero long-term debt**

**why it’s so cheap:**

Due to a classic boom-bust cycle the cannabis industry has been a **bloodbath** for investors. Since Canada legalized weed in 2018, stock prices have collapsed, most producers are down 90%+ from their highs.  
With oversupply flooding the market, driving prices from **$11.78/gram in 2019 to as low as $3.50**—all while burdensome excise taxes have crushed margins.

Now, the industry is **starting to turn**: bankruptcies and consolidations are wiping out weaker players, and wholesale prices have **begun rising again**.  
At some point, the government will likely **reform excise taxes**, given how much tax revenue ($15.1B federally) they’ve collected from cannabis sales.



While other cannabis stocks are burning cash, Cronos is **sitting on nearly $900M in net assets, generating positive cash flow, and reducing costs**.  
It also has one major advantage over competitors: **Altria (the $100B tobacco giant) owns over 40% of the company.**

Altria’s involvement provides Cronos with:

1. **A massive financial edge**—while competitors are struggling to stay afloat, Cronos is earning \~$50M annually in interest income.
2. **A path to U.S. cannabis legalization**—Altria is using Cronos as its foothold in the cannabis sector and could absorb it into its operations once federal legalization happens.

Beyond its strong balance sheet, Cronos also owns various other hidden assets, including real estate holdings and strategic equity stakes in PharmaCann (U.S.) and Vitura (Australia).

There were even **acquisition rumors** last year involving Curaleaf. Although that didn’t manifest, with its cash pile and Altria’s backing, Cronos remains a **interessting buyout target**.

 

The biggest risk I see is **Capital allocation.** A company with this much cash can destroy value through bad acquisitions, exessive spending, or other poor decisions. But given the **competence and financial background of the management team and Altria’s influence**, I consider this risk relatively low.

Right now, **Cronos is trading at a 17.7% discount to its net asset value**—an absurd price for a growing, cash-rich business.

Now, I get it—**weed stocks haven’t exactly been great investments.** I’m not arguing this should trade at 20x.

But I still think it shouldn’t be trading below liquidation value, especially considering its balance sheet strength, massive revenue growth, and the fact that it’s backed by a $100B tobacco giant.

1j8j9i6_NET,NET,Withdrawing from safety net vs. liquidating investments for mortgage downpayment (US),"I'm preparing to buy a house (well, condo). I'm fortunate to have enough money in investments (stocks/ETFs) to cover the minimum downpayment and still have a decent chunk of investments left over. I also have a safety net savings account. I'm trying to decide whether I should fund the downpayment just by liquidating investments or whether it makes sense to tap into my safety net account so that I can liquidate less of my investments.

On the one hand, liquidating investments triggers capital gains, whereas withdrawing from my safety net account does not. So preferring to withdraw from my safety net would reduce my tax bill. My investments are also long-term investments and the market is in a bit of a dip right now, so it seems like a bad time to be selling investments.

But OTOH, if I deplete my safety net then I'll want to build it back up. That will take time, and during that time I'd have to cover any unexpected expenses by liquidating my investments--potentially at a time when the market could be even lower than it is now.

I'm leaning toward preferring to deplete the safety net, but I couldn't find any discussion of this situation online. What would you do?",2025-03-11,1,1

The primary risk with these net-net type stocks is that they just bring the assets, but they have maintained a relatively steady NCAV over the past 5 years, showing that this will remain unlikely for the future.

A couple things to note:
- Since Nvidia and Broadcom have yet to report for the quarter, I estimated net income based on consensus EPS. This likely underestimates since they reliably beat estimates (especially Nvidia).
- I plotted all the companies on the same vertical scale so that we could directly compare differences in their earnings.
- At $34.4B (likely generous since it excludes much of the early period when Tesla was not profitable), Tesla has generated less cumulative net income than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia did in the last two quarters alone. I knew about the first three, but not the latter three. Moreover, it less net income in its entire corporate lifespan than Apple did **in last quarter alone**, in what was generally viewed as a disappointing quarter for Apple.
- The lead with which Apple has over the rest of the field is remarkable, although the overall trend appears flat. But I didn't appreciate the very strong seasonal trend with each release cycle leading into the holiday season.
- Alphabet actually takes the lead for the last year, topping $100 billion in net income.

* Encountered over ***50 metres net reservoir*** in the Otavi Group, derived from log analysis and indications of oil, which will be further confirmed from side wall cores.
* ***Indications of oil observed*** from the Damara Fold Belt.
* Follow-on ***drilling in the Damara Fold Belt is accelerated to drill Prospect I*** ahead of Kambundu, which is expected to spud in July 2025.

Note: yesterday, photos of the well, taken during drilling, surfaced online, and were indicative of significant oil having made its way up to the surface.  
  
The next drill target, Prospect I, has been chosen because it boasts 1800 meters of Otavi in its stratigraphy.

1i2n6hd_NET,NET,TSMC net profit hits record high as fourth-quarter results top expectations on robust AI chip demand,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.

Here are TSMC’s fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected
Net income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected

TSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.

As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.

TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.

“The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple’s latest iPhone 16 model.

The Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion — a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.


“We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for “close to a mid-teens percentage” of total revenue in 2024.

“Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,” Huang added.

However, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.

TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump’s inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.

Trump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. chip business. .

Still, Counterpoint’s Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.

Taiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.

Stocks of European semiconductor companies trading on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose Thursday, with ASML
 up 3.5%, ASM International
 gaining 3.75% and Besi
 rising 5.1%.

So I'm paper trading on TV and have been wanting to use realisitc parameters for capital pot, leverage and commissions to give me a real life comparison from a profit persepective.

So based on a £10,000.00 GBP pot with 1:1 leverage, the most BTCUSD I can trade per position is 0.1x BTCUSD (£93,457.45 each) and although the commission is a low % (averaging around 0.01 to 0.1%) the BTC value is high, so a round trip of fees of £30.00 GBP per trade.

I can't seem to make enough profit per position to make this work!  What do I need to change here? 

\-More leverage (this will incur more fees too)  
\-Better trades, longer moves to yeild higher profit

\-Larger Capital pot (£10k is probably my max irl)

  
I also tried the same with Micro Mini ES and although the commisions are less, (0.85USD per contract each way), again, I need to have buy 4x Micro ES contracts and have a decent market shift to make a profit.  Is this the best thing to trade in my position?

> Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.

> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

> Musk’s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week.

With Boeing (BA) set to release earnings tomorrow before the market opens, I've taken a look at some interesting setups ahead of the event.

In the attached chart, you can see the current price action of Boeing on the daily chart, along with the Net Gamma Exposure (GEX) by strike prices for this week. GEX can help gauge where market makers might have a significant hedging activity, giving us a clue about potential support/resistance levels. The bars indicate how much hedging could occur around key strikes like 160, 165, and 170, which might act as pivotal zones depending on the reaction to the earnings release.

Alongside this, I’ve highlighted a range of Call Calendar and Call Butterfly spread combinations that expire this week. These options strategies offer an efficient way to play a potential volatility spike while managing risk. The table breaks down:

Strike Prices: Each strike combination shows where the strategies are centered.
Price and Profit Potential: A quick glance at the potential returns based on current market conditions.
Risk-to-Reward Ratios (R/R): Some spreads have incredible R/R ratios but beware of calendars where the front leg will have a IV crash, so the R/R is pretty theoretical.
These spread strategies allow for flexibility going into the earnings event, especially if Boeing shows significant movement, which is common after earnings. Watch for how IV changes and consider adjusting positions as needed.

If you are interested, I can run my scan for put spreads as well, or iron condors.

***Strong Growth in Subscription-Based Recurring Revenue Continues for Healthy Extracts as Category Top Three Amazon Seller***

**LAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / October 17, 2024 /** [Healthy Extracts Inc](https://pr.report/3lcq). (OTCQB:HYEX), a platform for acquiring, developing, patenting, marketing, and distributing plant-based nutraceuticals that target select high-growth categories within the multibillion-dollar nutraceuticals market, reported preliminary record results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Net revenue is expected to exceed $740,000, a record for a third quarter, up more than 20% compared to the same year-ago quarter.

Gross margin for the quarter is expected to exceed 80%, driving positive operating cash flow and net profitability.

""In Q3, we achieved another quarter of record-breaking revenue, continued margin improvements, and further debt reduction, with this driven by robust performance in our direct-to-consumer channels,"" stated Healthy Extracts president, Duke Pitts. ""This consistent growth momentum with our key retail customers positions us for the successful launch of new products we are planning to introduce in the current quarter.""

The company generated record sales on Amazon in July, primarily as a result of its focused sales and marketing efforts for Prime Day and increased demand for its ""Subscribe & Save"" offers. During the quarter, the company continued to rank as a top three seller of Citrus Bergamot on Amazon among more than 100 competitors.

The company's products feature the only heart health supplement distributed in North America containing Citrus Bergamot SuperFruit™, which has the highest known concentration of polyphenols and flavonoids.

Given the success with Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save,"" in July Healthy Extracts replaced its traditional buy-2-get-1 offers on its eCommerce website with a 20% discount for subscribing to monthly shipments.

""We expect this move to increase sales and margins, as well as the lifetime value of our customers due to improved customer retention,"" noted Pitts. ""In fact, the new offer has been well received, generating a significant increase in overall subscriber growth during the first several weeks.""

Looking ahead, the company anticipates strengthening performance in top-line growth, profitability, and market share expansion as its addressable markets continue to grow. This positive outlook is largely due to the anticipated launch of new products that will benefit from the broad market channels the company has strategically developed and invested in over the past several years.

According to Pitts, ""These investments have proven to be the most effective way to create significant shareholder value-and this will continue to be our top priority.""

The preliminary unaudited results presented in this press release are estimates only and are subject to revision until the company officially reports its quarterly results in mid-November.",2024-10-17,1,1
1fy3s5u_NET,NET,Repeat CC rollover for net credit on stocks that I’m up on. Stupid? ,"I recently discovered CC’s after many years of just buying and holding stocks. Therefore, I’m super new to this so please bear with me a bit. (Can’t believe I was blind to this the entire time!)

So as a way to understand CC better I’m dipping into selling 1 or 2 contracts some on my positions that I have anywhere from a 30% to 50% gain on. I’m also long on the stocks. Let’s call them , RDDT, SOFI and PFE for clarity. 

I noticed that it’s sometimes possible to make several CC trades a week following the ups and downs of a stock at a net credit. It’s not always the case but mostly I’ve been able to capture a net credit. 

For example, in September I sold a $70 OCT 18 CC on Reddit for $1.56. On Friday, Reddit shot up past $70, to $72. I bought back the call for $4.46 and ended up rolling the CC up and put to $75 Nov 15 for $5.24. So not only did I increase by total premium I now can sell at $75. It seems that it’s possible to keep doing this as the stock goes up and collect premiums. Also seems that I can collect net credit if the stock drops several % points. 

For Pfizer, it seems that I can do both, collect net credit as the stock moves up and down. The net credit is minimal like $6 here, $10 there but hey it’s money and I’m just trying to understand CC strategies better. 

I actually don’t mind nickel and dimeing higher returns on my stocks.

1egteyi_NET,NET,Net replacement value of an automotive giant,"Hi everyone, I hope everyone is having a wonderful summer. I am trying to estimate equity value of an automotive company, and I think the best way to approach this is using net replacement value of assets. The idea, as always, is to go through the balance sheet one by one and adjust book value of assets/liabilities so as to estimate what a new entrant would have to pay to replace the assets. 

The difficulty I run into when I think about how best to apply this approach to an automotive giant is that:

(a) Like most other peers, the company has a financing unit, which is arguably an entirely different business from designing and manufacturing cars  
(b) The company breaks down its entire balance sheet by segment, which is very helpful for what I am trying to do, but alongside the main segments they report ""intersegmental transactions"" which in some lines are very substantial amounts, and I am not entirely sure how to even start treating this  
(c) the company a stake in a unit that it recently deconsolidated leading to a number of curious depreciation charges popping up on its income statement

My question to the lovely audience here is: has anyone tried this approach with an automotive company before, and if so, could you share some pointers? Or perhaps you guys have seen in the depths of the internet an example of a similar exercise, in which case I would be so grateful if you could share some resources.

I am happy to get a discussion going and hopefully together we can learn something :)",2024-07-31,2,3

1e1iyaw_NET,NET,Wells Fargo shares tumble after net interest income falls short of estimates ,"Wells Fargo on Friday reported a 9% decline in net interest income, even though its second-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations.

Here’s what the bank did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.33 versus $1.29 cents expected

Revenue: $20.69 billion versus $20.29 billion expected

The San Francisco-based lender recorded $11.92 billion in net interest income, a key measure of what a bank makes on lending, marking a 9% year-over-year decline. That was below the $12.12 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. The bank said the drop was due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs.

Shares of Wells Fargo fell nearly 7% in Friday’s trading.

“We continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income,” CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement. “The investments we have been making allowed us to take advantage of the market activity in the quarter with strong performance in investment advisory, trading, and investment banking fees.”

Wells Fargo saw net income dip to $4.91 billion, or $1.33 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.94 billion, or $1.25 per share, during the same quarter a year ago. The bank set aside $1.24 billion as provision for credit losses, which included a modest decrease in the allowance for those losses. Revenue rose to $20.69 billion in the quarter.

The bank repurchased more than $12 billion of common stock during the first half of 2024 and it expects to increase the third-quarter dividend by 14%.

The stock is up more than 22% this year, outperforming the S&P 500.

NEA was profitable in last several years on EBIT, EBITDA and even on Net profit basis. NEA was inreasing turnover in last several years (from 74m in 2019 to 110m in 2023). It is family company (family fund owns 30 percent of the business), with 75 years of history, backlog which covers basically whole year of production and it is a comapny which exports over 90 percent of its production.

NEA has zero debt and usually around 15 mil free cash, so with Market capitalization around 82 mil Eur, the EV is around 65 mil. Ebit was around 12 mil in 2023, so you can buy the company for less than 6x Ebit without cash.

The company has strong balance sheet with high advance payments from the customers, so the capital used for production of the machines is provided by the customers and it basically eliminates possible receivables payments issues. The capital requirements are also low thanks to this capital structure. Due to high backlog company is planning to invest for new production hall in Spain. Thanks to high unemployment in Spain , the turnover of employees is low and payroll costs are reasonable.

Couple days ago died long term Chairman and representative of the major owner Mr. Correa. He was replaced by other family members. Deputy Chairman became Chairman and another Correa family member became member of the board (he has long term experience in similar business and MBA from Kellogg. The death of Mr. Correa might serve as the catalyst for the changes in the company and possible sale of the company or takeover by the family. Even without the takeover, NEA is higly profitable, without debt, with increasing turnover and profits and backlogs which cover most of the year. New production hall would lead to higher turnover and profits in upcoming years.

TKO group describes themselves as a premium sports and entertainment company that comprises the UFC and WWE.   

On September 12, 2023 Endeavour group (the then owner of UFC) and WWE closed a transaction to combine the two entities to form a new, publicly listed company (TKO group holdings).  Endeavour Group Holding (also publicly traded btw) remains majority shareholder with 51% of outstanding shares. 

Unfortunately, there is not much data that I could find on the combined group.  Financials that I found cover only January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023 for UFC and September 12, 2023 – December 31, 2023 for the combined WWE and UFC.  Parent financials for are available for through Endeavour Group Holdings dating back only to 2021.  WWE financial reports are available back to 2000 as it was a separate publicly traded company.

History:
Both the UFC and WWE are household names and represent the most well recognized franchises in combat sports and wrestling entertainment respectively.  Additionally, both companies have long operating histories.  For reference the UFC just celebrated its 30th anniversary having hosted its first fight in 1993 and will be celebrating the UFC 300 event this coming April.  The WWE dates back even further, tracing its origins back to the 1950s being founded by either the father or grandfather of the well-known (and now somewhat infamous) figurehead Vince McMahon according to Wikipedia. 

About the business:
Under the new combined company the UFC and WWE will operate us separate entities.  The UFC will led by Dana White, who has served as president of the UFC since 2001 and grown it to a multibillion dollar business.  The WWE being led by Nick Kahn who joined the  WWE in 2020 and took over the role of President in 2021.

Per their 10K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 TKO group generates revenue from principal activities:

1. Media rights and content.
2. Live events.
3. Sponsorship.
4. Consumer products licensing.

1. Media and content:
TKO generates revenue from licensing live events and original programming to broadcasters domestically and internationally that carry TKO programming on digital and linear channels as well as pay-per-view.

These contracts last 3–5 years with broadcasters but they have some significant agreements lasting 7–10 years.

Broadcasters that have contracts with WWE or UFC include: ESPN, ABC, Comcast, Fox, Peacock, Tencent, Sony, Warner Brothers and now Netflix. 

Programming includes long and short for content, reality, series, and other filmed entertainment. Furthermore, TKO not only sells to distributors but also sells direct to consumers through UFC fight pass and WWE network.

2. Live events:
Live events generate revenue generation through ticket sales, site, fees, travel packages, and VIP experiences.

Between WWE and UFC generate 350 annual live events per year

3. Sponsorships:
TKO generates ad revenue and sponsorship revenue from sale of in-venue and in broadcasting advertising assets and digital impressions.

Ad revenues are driven by original content on third party social media platforms. For example, WWE has 100 million subscribers on YouTube and is the 12th most followed channel.

TKO group also has partnerships with major brands, including Anheuser-Busch, Draft Kings, GM, P&G, Monster Energy, Wendy’s, Toyo tires and others.

4. Consumer product licensing:
TKO group merchandises a broad, portfolio of products, including video games, trading cards, apparel, memorabilia, equipment, toys, and digital goods. This is done mostly through royalties and licensing fees, through sales of branded products and event sales as well as via e-commerce platforms. The largest sales items here are video games and toys. There are agreements with EA sports for UFC and Take Two for WWE for video game franchises.  Additionally, there are agreements with Mattel to produce toys.

Why invest?: 
1. Synergies- I believe there are synergies to be had between UFC and WWE in terms of securing media rights and sponsorships.  Further, Endeavour Group Holdings  as a majority shareholder with their talent management and online sports betting businesses is likely to be a motivated co-owner in furthering promotion of these two business brands. 

2. There are significant tailwinds to content provision.  Sponsors are projected to increase their spending  on live sports and entertainment advertising at a 9% CAGR over the next two years.  Streaming providers (Netflix, Amazon, Apple) are also expected to increase their spend by CAGR’s reaching the mid 20% range.  With the competition between streaming services heating up there is likely to be competition for sought after quality content such as the programming provided by WWE and UFC.

3. Mixed martial arts (MMA)  is growing rapidly in popularity with the UFC easily being the most recognized franchise in MMA. For example, it is reported that sports betting on UFC is the largest growing segment in the sports betting industry.  With rising popularity of their broadcasts they may be able to increase the pricing of ad placement. 

Risks:
1. WWE CEO Vince McMahon’s recent departure leads to less certainty with leadership, however, given the recent scandals surrounding him this may be more positive than negative for the WWE side of the business but the impact of this remains to be seen.

2. While WWE’s revenue has grown substantially over the past decade, growth has slowed and I don’t envision as much growth in this aspect of the combined business. 

3. It is possible that UFC’s growth could be hampered by increased competition from other combat sports / franchises including boxing, K1 kickboxing, Combat karate, and One Champ.  For the foreseeable future, however, UFC is clearly the dominant player in MMA.  

Valuation:
Valuation is somewhat difficult given the paucity of available information, however, management has provided 2024 FY guidance in their most recent report and are targeting a free cash flow conversion of greater than 50% with EBITDA in range of $1.15–1.17 billion.
From: https://investor.tkogrp.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/TKO_4Q23-Earnings-Release_2-27-24_FINAL.pdf

Now IF management performs as they predict for their 2024 full year guidance this would give an estimated free cash flow of $558 million at 50% FCF conversion of $1.15 billion EBITDA on the lower end of estimates to $644 million at a FCF conversion of 55% on $1.17 billion EBITDA on the upper end.

Given a market cap of $7.064 billion (as of March 28, 2024) this translates into a FCF yield of 7.90% at the low end of estimates and 9.12% at the upper end of estimates.

Also, Goldman Sachs recently initiated coverage at a buy with a price target of $102. 

All in all not a bad return IMO for owning two of the most dominant names in their respective domains.

Through proxies/friends own most of the shares and I guess don’t like selling to anyone who isn’t really known. It’s close to impossible to buy their shares on the exchange as hardly anything is ever sold. Not delisting because they feel that being listed is useful to them sometimes and the reasons are really best known to them.

1aepf5e_NET,NET,All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers,"When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that  
the numbers that they get are not accurate.   
if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.   
on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT  
Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.  
Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.  
This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.

HealthLynked Announces Q3 & Year-to-Date 2023 Financial Results, Highlighted by 8% Revenue Growth and Net Income Turnaround

NAPLES, FL, Nov. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- [HealthLynked Corp](https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/USOTC/healthlynked-qb-HLYK/stock-price). (OTCQB: [HLYK](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthlynked-announces-q3--year-to-date-2023-financial-results-highlighted-by-8-revenue-growth-and-net-income-turnaround-301988219.html#financial-modal)), a leader in the global healthcare network industry, announced its financial reporting for the quarter and nine-month period ending September 30, 2023.  The nine-month period was marked by revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a move toward profitability.

Revenue Increase: Achieved an 8% year-over-year (YoY) increase, totaling $4.796 million, compared to $4.45 million in the same period of 2022. Revenue growth was fueled by additional concierge fees and a steady increase in core technology subscription revenue.

Operational Efficiency: Operational loss was trimmed by a substantial 33%, declining from $4.51 million in 2022 to $3.04 million in 2023, due strategic restructuring resulting in a 13% reduction in operating expenses.

Net Income Achieved: Net income was $0.27 million, compared to net loss of $4.54 million in the same period of 2022, driven by the gains related to the sale of ACO Health Partners combined with year-over-year revenue and cost improvements.

**Q3 2023 Highlights**

Revenue Resilience: Despite a modest 2% YoY decline at $1.33 million compared to $1.36 million in Q3 2022 due to operational restructuring, HealthLynked is poised for a strong revenue rebound in the upcoming year.

Reduced Operating Loss: A 23% drop in operating loss from Q3 2022 $1.53 million to a more streamlined $1.18 million in 2023, demonstrating our commitment to cost management and operational efficiency.

17p2p3i_NET,NET,Sigmatron: a company flirting with a net-net valuation,"**DESCRIPTION:**
$19m market cap, p/sh $3.10, electronic manufacturing services. 

**THESIS:**
Sigmatron is a tier-3 electronic manufacturing services for many applications like consumer electronics, industrial electronics, portable devices etc. the company provides producers such as electronic connectors, electro-mechanical subassemblies, etc. almost a quarter of sales are from Electrolux (20.2%) and whirlpool (13.3%)

For 2023 the company report sales of $414m which a 10% increase compared to $378m for 2022. Net earnings for 2023 declined $4mm yoy to $14m due to interest expenses increasing $8.4m compared to $1.5M in 2022.
Operating cash flow for 2023 is -$20.5M and free cash flow is -$25m, although ttm FCF is a measly $730k.



Sigmatron acquired a company called ‘wagz’ in 2021 for $16m to strengthen several aspects of its business and improve margins. The acquisition Did not ultimately deliver what management had hoped for. Due to inflationary pressures and the shortages of equipments, 2023 sales for wagz decline significantly and when R&D and SGA expenses are taken in to account, the earnings for wagz was abysmal. these unfortunate events lead to non-cash impairment charges of $23m. The impairment led Sigmatron to breach credit covenants. The company agreed to sell 80% of wagz to another company for one dollar. Sigmatron retained 19% of wagz and agreed to provide $900k in financing for the month of April 2023. in exchange for selling wagz for essentially nothing, creditors agreed to more lenient covenants such as higher required leverage ratio and lower interest rate for the term loan, an increase in the revolver to $70m, and a longer maturity. Due to the new favorable debt conditions i think the likelihood of default is very low

The sale of the short-lived pet business and the focus on the much bigger segment (EMS) will allow Sigmatron to put focus back on getting the backlogged orders to costumers, improve gross and operating margins. 
For 2024 revenue should be stable and if macro conditions improve and costumers orders increase revenue should be stable or increase to $450m and ebitda should also be stable or increase to $35m.



**VALUATION:**
The company is cheap. Tangible book value is $67.3m or $11.05 and its trading at 88% of NCAV. EV/ebitda is 4. 
The company is highly likely to produce EBITDA of $35m in 2024 due to the factors I’ve outlined in the previous paragraph but, even if we take a conservative measure and assume 2024 EBITDA will be unchanged and remain at $30m a share price rise of 100% will only bring ev/ebitda to 4.5. I think the company could very well trade at 5x EV/EBITDA in 2024 and this is even conservative especially when comparing similar players in the industry with similar margins which comfortable trade at 7x.
With significant amount of margin of safety, relatively strong and stable operations, low risk of default, improving macro environment, and the sale of wagz the company should trade at $6.20-9.30/sh in the next year or two.

**TECHNICALS:**
improving RSI

**RISKS:**
Supply constraints and a macro environment that’s gloomier are really the only risks I can think of.

15ezk24_NET,NET,Netgear Net-Net,"I came across Netgear $NTGR today as a potential deep value stock. Basically, Netgear produces network hardware for homes and businesses with primary products being Wifi routers and modems. If you live in the US, you have probably used one of their products. This is a cyclical business with relatively flat revenue and cyclical margins/income. So, where is the value?

Assets:
Cash equivalent 203M
Inventories 324M
Current assets 734M
Intangible assets 37M
Total assets 927M

Total Liabilities 314M

So, current assets-liabilities are $420M and tangible book value $576M. The Market cap is $396M. Cash equivalents are >50% of market cap.

Revenue has ranged between $900M to $1,400M over the past decade. 5y average income has been 11M and 5y fcf is basically $0. The previous 5 years free cash flow average of $88M. 

Netgear has bought back roughly 3% of shares per year over the past decade, so there isn't an issue of shareholder dilution. 

The thesis here is that your tangible shareholder equity and current assets exceed total liabilities which provides a large MOS. Netgear is priced at a near worst case scenario, that being the company will not be profitable and the value being strictly in the assets. Netgear's largest segment, wifi routers, is expected to grow 8% per year through the next 5 years and Netgear specifically expected to grow revenue 15% in 2024. 2020-2021 saw a general consumer spending bull market with an unsurprising bear market to follow.

https://i.imgur.com/LeAFFvS.jpg

>Since the Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates last year, more and more economists warned that a US recession was imminent.

>But that recession has not yet arrived, and there's no sign a recession is near even after reliable indicators like the inverted yield curve flashed red flags.

>According to Societe Generale, ""something very strange has happened"" that explains why a US recession has been delayed, and it has to do with some timely moves made by corporations.

>The bank highlighted that going back to at least 1975, corporate net interest payments would rise as the Fed raised interest rates. But for the first time in a long time, that isn't happening. Instead, as the Fed raised rates over the past 15 months, corporate net interest payments actually fell.

>""Normally when interest rates rise, so too do net debt payments, squeezing profit margins and slowing the economy. But not this time,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a Thursday note, pointing to a chart that he called the ""strangest"" he has seen in a very long time.

>So, what exactly is happening?

>It turns out that during the period of near-zero interest rates, especially leading up to the pandemic and during the pandemic, corporations took advantage and refinanced a ton of their liabilities into long-term, low-rate, fixed debt.

>According to data from Bank of America earlier this year, companies bought themselves some time to navigate higher rates. **The debt composition of S&P 500 companies includes just 6% in short-term floating rate debt, just 8% in long-term floating rate debt, 10% in short-term fixed debt, and a whopping 76% in long-term fixed debt.**

>This ""helps explain the recession's tardiness,"" SocGen's Edwards said, highlighting that net interest payments have fallen 25% at a time when they would have risen sharply based on history.

>**""Companies have effectively played the yield curve in reverse and become net beneficiaries of higher rates, adding 5% to profits over the last year instead of deducting 10%+ from profits as usual,"" Edwards said.**

>The lack of a profit decline means companies didn't have to resort to a big wave of layoffs that would have dented the economy and thrown it into a recession.

>The low-rate, long-term debt held by corporations, combined with their pricing power during a time of elevated inflation, means most businesses were able to grow profits in a big way.

>""Interest rates simply aren't working as they once did. It is indeed a mad, mad world,"" Edwards concluded.

>All of this could change if companies have to refinance their debt at higher rates. But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it's possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.

14ora88_AVGO,AVGO,"Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?","In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA’s stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA’s stock valuation may be inflated. 

As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.

To evaluate NVIDIA’s valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company’s financial profile reveals key information:

Examining NVIDIA’s quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.

These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA’s revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company’s overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock’s current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.

	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA’s market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued.
	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA’s EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock’s valuation.
	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.

To assess NVIDIA’s valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company’s financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.

AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry’s current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.

Micron’s negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA’s valuation.

AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.

Comparing AVGO’s Annual Income Statement with NVDA’s provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:

AVGO Annual Income Statement:

	•	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million
	•	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million

NVDA Annual Income Statement:

	•	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million
	•	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million

Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.

In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO’s net income.

These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.

Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA’s current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.

Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA’s stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.

While the company’s prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA’s stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.",2023-07-02,130,65
14m93i9_NET,NET,Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he’s written an annual letter showing us how he did it.,"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.  
Just because a company does well short term doesn’t mean it’s sustainable.  
“When the tide goes out, you’ll see who’s been swimming naked.”  
This isn't just investors.  
It's businesses too.",2023-06-29,1140,365

I plan to add a few more REITs (MHC-UN, MPW (a FAT maybe), AP-UN (a FAT maybe), BTB-UN) then ignore it for the foreseeable future.

I'm valuing stocks off their dividend history, payout ratio history, sustainability/growth (UNII, AFFO, NII, DNII, FCF, etc.), and stock performance. But also going off their P/AFFO, P/FCF, P/UNII, P/DNII, etc. Which I think shows if a stock is trading 'at par', above, or below its normal valuation.

Note: I really enjoy researching stocks so if this seems like 'overkill' just know its extremely relaxing and I love doing this.

P/NII (Consolidated with absorbed fund):

Because PDI shares its annual results around Aug. we don't have any updated numbers to go off of so we will go off their NII (Net Investment Income + Realized gains) / shares outstanding to get a NII per share.  
Their results are an absolute mess due to the share price falling since Jun 2021, and varying NII before the merger in 2022 jumped the NII up a large amount.

148dxy0_NET,NET,Thematic Analysis for Net-New Capital Allocation,"I have a core position of dividend payers that I will never sell and stop reinvesting. However I want to try an experiment with any net-new investing from my earned income into a new pie on M1. 

The goal would be to use a thematic analysis of the current market conditions and attempt to identify the best potential dividend growth stocks in the sectors that are most likely to benefit from the new normal.

This is from the perspective of a US investor. 

Assumption 1: Rates may pull back over the next 6-12 months, but the era of free money is over for a long while. 

Assumption 2: On-shoring /Near-Shoring will accelerate as a result of the pandemic and the shock to many industries’ supply chains.

Assumption 3: In order to remain competitive in the market, these companies that near-shore/on-shore a significant portion of their production will need to invest heavily in automation to keep costs down. 

Assumption 4: It will take some time for financial institutions to roll their lower-rate loans off their books, but once the “new normal” of higher rates settle into the minds of consumers, banks and other financial institutions will begin to benefit from the higher rates.

Assumption 5: Higher rates means smaller to mid sized companies are incentivized to give equity for funding instead of taking loans. 

Assumption 6: We will not see the reduction in global geopolitical risk, which will increase the importance of strategic assets like high-end chips, energy, and other precious/strategic items

Would love your feedback on these themes/assumptions. Where am I wrong, what else have I not considered? What’s on your mind?

Will use this thread as a screen to begin narrowing down to see what I find. Maybe nothing. I might already be where I need to be.",2023-06-13,1,1

13xs0x7_NET,NET,"May + $53,918. This is how I utilize ""mistake tracking"" to make myself aware of bad habits, allowing me to avoid these mistakes and increase my net profit without having to increase my size.","**Context:**

I am a small caps trader that primarily focuses on scalping. I have been trading for 3 years and spent 1.5 years trading options in large/mid caps and the past 17 months trading small caps.

I use ThinkorSwim and Das Trader as my brokerage and I have been closely focused on tracking my ""mistake trades"" since the beginning of 2023. The result has been that even in some months where my gross gain has been similar as previous months, my overall profit is higher because I had less losing trades. 

[May Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/eyikx801lg3b1.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=da2e3bc97add17fd42b3aec466222c8ff96444d5)

[May total losses](https://preview.redd.it/pels7t57lg3b1.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c6bf1cc71f91268d943e3353fa8fd50a1aead9d6)

**Mistake Tracking:** 

No matter an individual's style of trading, all traders have experience emotional trading to some degree. For some people this is a small issue, but for others, it can be a main reason they are not achieving their full potential.

I noticed this was a problem with my trading. So I started tracking my trades at the end of each month.  I categorize my losing trades like this:

* Failed thesis

&#x200B;

* Boredom Trades
* Overtrading
* Greedy Trades
* Revenge Trades

I split ""Failed thesis"" from the other 4 categories because failed thesis trades require a more in-depth review and edge refinement, whereas the other 4 types stem from discipline and focus.

When I reviewed a few months of my trading at the start of 2023, I found that I was averaging about 10x trades a month that were COMPLETELY avoidable. A quick revenge trade after a failed thesis, overtrading on a slow day, or a greedy trade at the end of a great day. In the moment they didn't seem like much to me, but when viewed altogether I realized I was hemorrhaging $5k-$10k a month in essentially ""free money"".

Over the course of the next few months I focused heavily on tracking those mistakes, and I immediately became more aware of my bad habits during the trading day. After a couple months, I was down to 3-5 bad trades a month instead of 10, and now I can go a couple weeks with only 1 or 2 discipline slip ups.

Even though I still make these same mistakes, I have quantified them and am actively working to decrease the frequency that I make them. I am not sure it is possible to avoid mistakes completely, but simply being more aware of them (tracking) has drastically reduced the amount of them I make. This puts more profit straight into my pocket, and motivates me because I can see the improvement.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Perfect place to be invested in Clean Air, Clean Water, a cleaner earth-  advanced wound care AND top-notch battery tech - on the brink of profitability.

[Highlight from THE  Annual Report Earnings Call today - for the first  time ever, in Q4 BLGO achieved net positive cash from operating activities! That doesn't mean profitable, because they still need to overcome non-cash charges, but it's an important milestone! ](https://preview.redd.it/bsobol9c9esa1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=1987cb62f6bb6cae1170445bb585dc3eff0685c9)

&#x200B;

>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to strengthening the  nation’s water infrastructure, while providing significant resources to  address key challenges, including climate change, emerging contaminants  like per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and cybersecurity.“

And BioLargo has [**The BEST PFAS TREATMENT**](https://www.bestpfastreatment.com) **- Must click link for all the info about the tech!**

With  BioLargo’s AEC technology, “at  the end of a treatment cycle,  instead of having 80,000 pounds of waste,  we might have 85 pounds,”  says Moore.  BioLargo is also working on a  sustainable way of extracting PFAS from the spent membrane, destroying the PFAS, and sending the membrane residue to a landfill.

&#x200B;

>Dennis P. Calvert, the company’s President and CEO, said, “2022 was our strongest year yet in terms of financial performance, and we are eager for the day when our valuation reflects the significance of our ongoing success. With Pooph revenues leading the way and other key catalysts like our PFAS treatment business just now coming online, we’re confident that this year will herald even more significant growth at the company.”

Company management provides highlights of the annual report below, but encourages investors to review the full report to get the most complete information about BioLargo and its growing cleantech business, including the risk factors beginning at page 12.

**Key financial highlights:**

* Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $5,884,000, which was a 132% increase over 2021. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $2,096,000, a 40% increase as compared with the third quarter of 2022 (quarter-over-quarter), and a 167% increase as compared with the fourth quarter of 2021.
* The company no longer has any outstanding convertible debt.
* The company’s total net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was reduced by 26% as compared with the prior year, from $6,894,000 to $5,132,000. Approximately 50% of the company’s net loss was due to non-cash expenses, including $2,071,000 of stock option compensation expense, and $291,000 of services paid by the issuance of our common stock. Net cash used in operations decreased 30% to negative $2,760,000.
* Net stockholders’ equity rose from $933,000 at the end of 2021 to $2,011,000 at the end of 2022.
* The company ended the year with $3.1 million in current assets and working capital of $1.6 million.

**Key commercial and developmental highlights:**

* Revenues from sales of the Pooph pet odor control product to Ikigai Marketing Works have escalated significantly, resulting from the ongoing success of Ikigai’s national marketing campaign for the product and its rollout into Walmart stores in the US.
* The company’s AEC water treatment system has been tested and proven to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water to below levels required by the EPA’s recently proposed limitations of four parts per trillion. These so-called “forever chemicals” accumulate in the human body, are linked to multiple health issues, and are more and more the subject of government regulatory concern.  
* The company acquired the IP rights to a sodium-sulfur battery, a technology with unique technical features that enable it to address a need in the market for safe, affordable, long-term energy storage at grid-scale, at electric vehicle charging stations, or similar static applications. The technology is already developed, and BioLargo has formed and secured seed capital for a new subsidiary which will lead the manufacturing, scale-up, and operations for the new technology.

Q1 2023 projected to bring in more revenue than Q1, Q2, Q3 of 2022  combined ;) yet the price has not reacted to the Blockbuster success of  POOPH where **the national rollout to all Walmart locations** has just started and it is a bestseller at Amazon, Chewy and Walmart online  already.

* BTW-   don’t forget that the BLGO CFO decided to solely get paid in  options for the next years that have an exercise price around today’s  levels  (.20) That means you can currently buy shares cheaper than what the CFO will have to pay for shares - as his SOLE payment.

**OP:**

**“Price is what you pay - value is what you get.” W.B.**  

 Record growth, record revenues, new subsidiary- welcome “BETI”, new seed capital, new tech, new employees, new channel partners, new patents,  new Pooph sales records, new bestseller rankings on Walmart, Chewy,  Amazon, new retail expansion etc.  Nationwide Walmart launch in Q2 

 Yet, the market cap at $55 million is still at pre-deriskpre-revenue, pre revenue, pre-channel partner expansion, pre-growth, pre-net loss reduction, pre-debt elimination, pre AEC, pre-Pooph, pre Clyra sales team, pre-paradigm shift - Levels.

**There is a huge discrepancy between the value and the price here. And it is just a question of time until new folks will take advantage of it.  ;)**

IMHO There is no better place to invest than in CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, A CLEANER EARTH + MEDICAL ARM, AND BATTERY TECH - with a real shot to win the Clean tech Jackpot. 

It is a great time to discover this. Do your own DD!

Canadian Net REIT is one of the few public Triple Net 'QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) / gas station REITs' available on the public market. With its closest 'cousin' being $GTY (Getty), and $CRR-UN (Crombie REIT). It has a lot to love about it:

* **Very conservative AFFO Payout Ratio:** 57% -2022 | 56% - 2021
* **Solid tenants:** Parkland, Suncor, Loblaws, Walmart, Sobeys, Metro, $QSR (Tim Hortons), Benny&Co
* **Occupancy has remained very high 99% - 100** (by year end)
* **FFO increased by 20.4% in 2023**, **while AFFO (per share) increased 10%** ($0.54 to $0.592)

But while saying this NET-UN has performed HORRIBLY with the stock price reaching a 5yr low today, and ending the day break even with its 5yr price (not to mention its down 32% 1Y).

# Opinion:

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I currently own 200 shares of NET-UN @ $5.40.   
I fully intend to continue buying if/when the stock continues to fall (which I fully expect to happen as REITs continue to get destroyed (mostly AP-UN and NET-UN)) .   
The way I look at it is that NET-UN won't go bankrupt within the year, has enough assets to cover liabilities, is still experiencing double digit growth, and has a very stable dividend with a consistent AFFO payout ratio (between 55% - 60%). While this REIT may be small they are actively looking to expand and sell their weaker performing property. 

 I'm surprised to see the **National Bank Of Canada ($NA)** owns so many shares of this small REIT, which has flown under the radar for a ton of investors.",2023-04-04,2,3

BioLargo,  Inc. (OTCQB:BLGO), a developer of sustainable cleantech technologies  and full-service environmental engineering company, announced that its  Annual Report, filed March 31, 2023, showed a 132% increase in revenues  over 2021, and a 26% decrease in net loss ([www.biolargo.com/sec-filings](http://www.biolargo.com/sec-filings)).

Company  management below provides a summary of the annual report's highlights,  including the company's financial performance and progress of key  projects.

BioLargo will hold an  investor webcast today, Monday, April 3, 2023, at 1:30 pm Pacific / 4:30  pm Eastern, at the following link, open to the public: [https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2448/47877](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2448/47877)

>Dennis  P. Calvert, the company's President and CEO, said, ""2022 was our  strongest year yet in terms of financial performance, and we are eager  for the day when our valuation reflects the significance of our ongoing  success. With Pooph revenues leading the way and other key catalysts  like our PFAS treatment business just now coming online, we're confident  that this year will herald even more significant growth at the  company.""

Company management provides highlights of the annual report below, but encourages investors to review the full report to get the most complete information about BioLargo and its growing cleantech business, including  the risk factors beginning at page 12.

**Key financial highlights:**

* Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $5,884,000, which was a 132% increase over 2021.
* Revenue  in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $2,096,000, a 40% increase as compared with the third quarter of 2022 (quarter-over-quarter), and a  167% increase as compared with the fourth quarter of 2021.
* The company no longer has any outstanding convertible debt.
* The company's total net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was reduced by 26% as compared with the prior year, from $6,894,000 to  $5,132,000.
* Approximately  50% of the company's net loss was due to non-cash expenses, including  $2,071,000 of stock option compensation expense, and $291,000 of  services paid by the issuance of our common stock.
* Net cash used in operations decreased 30% to negative $2,760,000.
* Net stockholders' equity rose from $933,000 at the end of 2021 to $2,011,000 at the end of 2022.
* The company ended the year with $3.1 million in current assets and working capital of $1.6 million.

**Key commercial and developmental highlights:**

* Revenues  from sales of the Pooph pet odor control product to Ikigai Marketing  Works have escalated significantly, resulting from the ongoing success of Ikigai's national marketing campaign for the product and its rollout into Walmart stores in the US.
* The  company's AEC water treatment system has been tested and proven to   remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water to below  levels required by the EPA's recently proposed limitations of four parts  per trillion. These so-called ""forever chemicals"" accumulate in the human body, are linked to multiple health issues, and are more and more the subject of government regulatory concern.
* The company acquired the IP rights to a sodium-sulfur battery, a technology with unique technical features that enable it to address a need in the market for safe, affordable, long-term energy storage at grid-scale, at electric vehicle charging stations, or similar static applications. The technology is already developed, and BioLargo has formed and secured seed capital for a new subsidiary that will lead the manufacturing,  scale-up, and operations for the new technology.

Net options sentiment & GEX may be moving stocks","The market saw a glorious rebound this week potentially fueled by gamma-imbalances forcing dealers into buy-side pressure. Stocks squeezed higher before reverting slightly back down to the mean on Friday.

&#x200B;

Funds have been keeping their dry powder tight, but the tide could be changing as institutions start “loading the boat”, per say. Big tech such as AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, et al have been lagging in the rallies as of late, but the data is now telling a different story ([screenshots from the ProsperoAI app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)). Here’s a look at net institutional inflows.

https://preview.redd.it/ut309u5zddga1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf84941f726b2e6b91bb4c5ad6c3e367f769403d

&#x200B;

A glance back at Tesla from prior weeks had net options sentiment at elevated levels for some time, the share price followed suit with a move to the upside.

https://preview.redd.it/vwiks3a0edga1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=39dc4de4271b77635a322d7267382fc2cbc03f1e

&#x200B;

The Tesla rally my have been triggered with the perfect storm of net institutional inflow and net options sentiment. The option activity and net options sentiment may be telling us where the market will head next.

https://preview.redd.it/1c7a5z11edga1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=5013d346f477411160235649d63df62c850b050b

&#x200B;

The market has been wonky and gamma exposure seems to be the catalyst with this volatile move up. IMO we should keep an eye on option flow and let it guide the way for the next move in either direction. A drop in bullish sentiment may give room for the market to take a breather after the leg up we just saw in January.

&#x200B;

Two other names I’m seeing some of the option flow turn to the downside (and possibly push the stock back to the mean) are in GPS (Gap) and MDB (MongoDB). Both of these names saw rather large moves in the last 5 days (over 20% to upside), with MDB already giving some of those gains back.

&#x200B;

GPS showing low values in institutional flow, options sentiment and also social sentiment, but rather high risk on downside breakout. This could lead to more volatility in not just GPS, but more mid-cap names as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ydf9rzr1edga1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff433a1318e9c52faaedc03e19a02d263c9f35e

&#x200B;

MDB was showing a similar pattern to what was found in Tesla not long ago. Elevated net options sentiment for some time followed by increase in share price. It wouldn’t surprise me to see more downside (already 15% reversal last week) should some of the option flow change rapidly with the rest of the market.

https://preview.redd.it/jr5nca52edga1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=516c951d19035afe921746c7dc86641435b65463

# Summary

The slight increase in the downward trend of net options sentiment may be a sign of a bull trap. Although the VIX remains somewhat unchanged (weird), volatility and wide swings in share price are back on the menu. Thus option flow and net options sentiment may play a significant role in guiding us where the market wants to go next. IMO I am cautiously optimistic the market has found a long-term bottom and we may start to trend higher while seeing periods of volatility at the same time, like we did this week.

102h8hr_NET,NET,"Net-nets aren't extinct, here are two I expect to emerge from the primordial ooze in 2023","I focus on Net-Nets in my daily investing and usually nowadays they are only found in non-US exchanges or in nano caps trading OTC. But I do have two positions that I own that I expect to become net-nets this year that actually have decent sized market caps and thought I'd share them as my picks of the year.

**Seritage (SRG)** \- Sears real estate holdings being liquidated. Trading at $12 which is roughly book value while company distribution range is $18-$27 so they expect to sell properties for significantly over carrying values and so far looks like that is happening. They may have sold as much as a half billion in real estate in Q4 2022, which would be a big step towards loading current assets with cash, and they are rapidly paying down debt with these sales.

**Risks:** are it's fairly levered, if sale prices come in under book that equity disappears rapidly. They have a deadline to pay-down debt this year which I'm pretty confident they are almost done. And it's an Eddie Lampert play and he's been selling.

**TCI** \- A family owned apartments business, trading $44 with a $90 book value. They just unwound a big joint venture carried at way under market value, which massively increased book value. Its a complex structure, it's 80% owned by another public company that is 80% owned by the founders family, and one of their subs issued bonds on the Israeli exchange, but its simplifying. The founder died a few years ago and they've been selling properties the last few years so my thesis is they will want to sell it or break it up.

**Risks:** The family controls it completely. They could double down on new real estate or businesses or even cr\*pto, and not much outside investors can do. its a value trap if they can't decide on a catalyst. My simplistic theory is that I don't get along that well with my siblings so why should they? That made me bet they likely all have different ideas of what they'd like to do with their wealth and will just find the most tax favorable way to break it up.

**Disclosure**: This ain't investment advice, do your own due diligence. Sometimes I make mistakes, often enough that I should really say sometimes I don't make mistakes. And note that I may sell at any time without notice or updating this post.

And thanks in advance to anyone who comments on this post! No matter how wrong your opinions are, addressing them forces me to re-examine my assumptions and maybe consider things I missed, and can only help, so fire away.",2023-01-03,29,25

What is a net-net stock? [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-net.asp).

Info about the data:

The program screened the balance sheets of \~30k instruments. There are two formulas that tell if a given stock is net-net - **NCAV** and **NNWC** (more info [here](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/investing-strategy/graham-net-net-stocks/)). That’s why there are two separate sheets in the spreadsheet.

The algorithm computes the NCAV/NNWC per share for each stock and then computes a score. The score is a number between 0 and 1:

*ncavScore = NCAVPS / price*

*nnwcScore = NNWC / price*

Instruments with smaller scores are more undervalued.

Disclaimer: The ones with a score < 0.25 are filtered out to avoid potential invalid data from the API I used.

1.)Sending http requests with return a json string which can be easily written to file and/or parsed to extract data elements. (this seems pretty easy which makes me wonder why sdk wrapper even exists)

2.) Figuring out C# sdk wrapper for a data vendor such as Alpaca. (This has been a nightmare for me involving multiple software downloads, tracing classes and methods through obsolete functions and discontinued help files pushed off onto GitHUb which is another headache in itself.

&#x200B;

3.) Wesocket subscription. I am assuming I can just code this without using too many vendor specific functions so lets just pretend this option doesn't exist and choose from the first 2 options through rest api.

SINGAPORE, Nov. 1, 2022

*The arts and collectibles technology segment of the Group is showing strong growth with the first nine months revenue for 2022 at* *US$8,051,436.  It is a 1,534% increase as compared to 2021's figures of just* *US$524,868.* 

SINGAPORE, Nov. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Metaverse Blockchain company Coinllectibles™️, a fully owned subsidiary of Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. (OTC: COSG), is pleased to announce that the Group has released the latest financial results for 2022 Q3.

Some of the financial highlights are:

* As at end 2022 Q3, Cosmos Group made a total revenue of US$12,884,869 and had about US$1.97million cash on hand. The comprehensive loss for the first nine months was US$90.26million, US$86.4million of which consisted of a one-time share based compensation payment in 2022 Q1.
* Total assets of the Group was at US$43.97million, which included approximately US$18.45million of loans receivables and US$15.58million of intangible assets, while the total liability was only at US$29.15million.
* The lending segment accounted for US$4,833,433 of net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to US$4,985,476 for the same period in 2021. This represents a marginal decrease of about US$152,043, or 3%, and demonstrates the stability of our lending segment. For the same period, total operating expense was approximately US$2.81million – which translates to a lending segment income of US$1.03million.
* The arts and collectibles technology was responsible for over a majority of the revenue growth of the Company, with US$8,051,436 of net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to US$524,868 for the same period in 2021, representing a significant increase of approximately 1,534%. For the same period, the total operating expense was approximatley US$97.76million – which translates to a segment loss of US$90.85million.

Commenting on the 2022 Q3 results, Toby O'Connor**, CEO for Coinllectibles**, said, ""I would say that this is a very encouraging result.  We have seen very strong growth in our arts and collectibles segment, with more than US$8million in revenues in the last 9 months.  Making these results more significant, is that this growth is amidst a backdrop of an overall 'market winter'.""

""I would also like to share my thoughts on the expense side of things.  In 2022 Q3, our Group's operating expense was about US$10.63million.  In my view, this is the kind of expense level that we aim to maintain at.  By maintaining our cost while supercharging our arts and collectibles revenue growth, we really want to reach a sustainable point – which will help us ride through any unforeseen market uncertainties,"" Toby added.

yguoax_NET,NET,Selling my house after 4 years. Net worth will drop $100k but no more headaches. Should I do it?,"I bought an investment property in 2018 (before I knew about VTSAX) in the Bay Area and recently my tenants called me to tell me they plan to move out. Before I bought the house, I never imagined all the headaches of homeownerships when dealing with maintenance/repairs (roof/termite/pipe/mold/electrical/etc.). As of now I want to sell my house and use the money to invest everything in VTSAX. I'm currently 29 years old and my goal is to FIRE before 40 as I only spend ~$1.5k/month. Originally, I was going to sell the house by 35-37 so I could have all my money in VTSAX and not deal with tenants/house issues when I retire. However, since my tenants are leaving in a few months, I have an opportunity to sell my house earlier.

I bought the house in 2018 for $635k and it's now worth $745k according to Zillow. I used a Home Sale Proceeds Calculator and it revealed that I would [take home $285k](https://i.imgur.com/FIL2RRl.png) after fees/closing cost/mortgage payout/etc from selling the house. After utilizing a Capital Gains Tax Calculator, I would pay ~$25k in taxes and therefore my take home would be $260k.

Some info about the house:

* Tenants pay me $2.5k/month
* Mortgage is 3.3% interest and is $2.5k/month (escrow included)
* Mortgage Left = $384,933.98
* Property bought in 2018 for $635k with ~$225k downpayment.

ybjd10_NET,NET,Looking into Tesla's Q3 | Liquidity >60% concerning? | Revenue up 56% YoY and net profit up 103.5%,"Tesla Inc (NSDQ: TSLA) was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. It designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, as well as energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. 

&#x200B;

The company as of 21 October 2022 is valued at $649.51bn, although shares have fallen from $400 to $215 since the start of the year. 

&#x200B;

Their Q3 for the year was released on 19 October 2022.

&#x200B;

Revenue was up 56% to $21,454m (compared to last year), while net profit was up 103.5% to $3,292m. This means its net margin improved from 11.8% to 15.3%. 

&#x200B;

The short-term liquidity (current liabilities/current assets) of Tesla is high, at a current rate of 68.4%, despite improving from 72.2% this time last year. Investors will want to see this rate drop below 50% as soon as possible and show a tighter control of liabilities. Rising interest rates will not coincide well for company's with high liabilities, although rising net profit margins may provide optimism that its liquidity will continue improving. 

&#x200B;

Current assets increased 44% to $35,990m, while current liabilities increased 36.3% to $24,611m. 

&#x200B;

Tesla's long-term liquidity (total liabilities/total assets) is at a much healthier rate than its short-term liquidity, having dipped to 46.5% in the Q3. This shows that the company is in a tighter financial position in the short-term period (one year), than its long-term.  

&#x200B;

Total assets increased 28.7% to $74,426m since last year, while total liabilities were up at a slower rate of 12.3% to $34,575m. Long-term liquidity has improved from 53.2% to 46.5% during that timeframe. 

&#x200B;

Total cash levels have also been steadily increasing since last year, which is impressive when liquidity is simultaneously decreasing, which again may be thanks to rising net profit margins. Total cash increased 31.1% to $21,107m, which made up 61.1% of the company's total liabilities. 

&#x200B;

wmwhvn_NET,NET,ESS Tech (iron flow batteries) post first revenue in Q2 and improved net losses - short-term and long-term liquidity improves,"ESS Tech (NYSE: GWH) is an energy storage company, designing and producing long-duration batteries using earth-abundant materials. Its batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Its technology addresses energy delivery, duration, and cycle-life in a single battery platform that compares favourably to lithium-ion batteries. The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon.

ESS Tech reported their Q2 for the year (ending 30 June) on 11 August and for the first time since being founded they reported a revenue - amounting to $680,000 and a landmark moment for the company. Their share value increased by more than 18% during subsequent daily trading.

Investors should still note the net loss of ($15.6m), significantly higher than their revenue - representing a net margin loss of 2,294%. Net losses in recent quarters have been as high as ($180m). Investors could be betting that the net margin loss will improve ahead of a landmark moment for renewable energy in the US.

If signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) would allocate $369bn to households and businesses to solely invest in renewable energy sources – a historic amount that scientists estimate will lead to carbon reductions of 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels - as well as positively impacting climate-related equity investments.

The first thing worth checking when a company is seeing consistent net losses is how strained its current assets to current liabilities are becoming.

In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. ESS Tech's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 6.83% (current liabilities/current assets) - demonstrating significant control over short-term liabilities. This significantly improved compared to last year's quarter, which was 8.97%

Current assets and current liabilities stand at $199.4m and $13.6m, respectively.

Total cash for the company is up significantly from recent times, seeing $8.02m as of 30 September 2021 increase to $239m by the end of 2021. Total cash has since fallen to $112.7m for Q2 - however, softened by liquidity.

Total assets were down over the last six months to $216.1m (from $250.2m) - however, total liabilities have also decreased significantly to $29.3m (from $40m).

Long-term liquidity percentage improved in the last six months from 16% to 13.6%.

2021 was also a landmark year for ESS Tech to bolster its balance sheet and get on top of previously elevated liabilities seen in the previous two years. Total assets from FY20 to FY21 increased from $9.02m to $250m (with 95.6% consisting of total cash) - while total liabilities remained fairly flat at $45m.

Significant growth in Q2 revenue which gained 246% YoY to $66.9m, from $19.3m in last year's quarter - paired with an improvement in their net losses during the same timeframe.   


Net losses were ($32m), down from ($100.2m) in last year's quarter. This meant their net margin loss decreased from (519%) to (47.8%).  


In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. Stem's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 41.6% (current liabilities/current assets). This compared to last year's quarter, which was 30.1%.    


Total cash levels have fallen during the year so far to $335m, which was down from $474m in last year's quarter.  


Despite this, total assets have been increasing four quarters in a row to $1,427m - which represented a 104% rise in a year.   


Total liabilities have inflated to a current level of $823m - but the good news is their long-term liquidity percentage decreased to 57%, down from an alarming 80% in last year's quarter.

WARNING: This is an experiment I am carrying out with roughly 10% of my capital (rest is going into improving my house) to try and exploit low market conditions that has increased the yield on stocks that are still making money and paying well. Unsatisfied with dividend information on finance sites and the usual apps, I have made a spreadsheet to work this out myself as best as I can. I welcome any feedback no matter how brutal, I'm a pirate, money is a fluid concept for me. Do not try this at home, only at sea.

**Background:**

Ok, so I'm one of those idiots that saw a really high ZIM dividend and decided to test it out by buying a few days before the pay-out. This led me down a a 3 month journey investigating shipping stocks that seemingly pay high dividends and inevitably led me to [r/dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/).

I thought, is it possible to make a portfolio that would **aim to net 10% over the next year** without taking share price growth into account. So 3 months later, here is my ""absolutely don't touch this with a bargepole, rogue pirate investor, virtually gambling ETF"" made up of super high dividend stocks (and some wildcards) - I proudly present the AARG ETF.

**The strategy:**

I'm using my ISA Account (£20,000 tax free wrapper in UK) to purchase gradually over the last month a number of stocks that pay high dividends and plan to use the tax free earnings to purchase the higher yielding ones each quarter as they announce dividends (and importantly - good earnings). Aside from withholding tax, there are no other taxes to pay in this system so every penny I receive is pure profit. I just spent my last penny of the 20k limit and I'm ready to share my positions.

**The data:**

I think all the general data out there on yield is **fundamentally flawed and misleading**. It bases current yield on prior dividends but does not account for the consistency. It also does not account for withholding tax which can differ from country to country. Obviously, one can't predict with 100% accuracy but part of this plan is to help me understand dividend behaviour to allow me to make more accurate predictions as well as account for withholding tax. ZIM is currently showing as 35% yield on Google - I'm willing to be my entire investment that no one is walking away with anything near that amount this time next year.

I have used Stock Events and [trackyourdividends.com](https://trackyourdividends.com/) and I was equally unimpressed with the yield data. I think all those uploaders of their dividend yield are going to have a nasty surprise when they see what actually ends up in their account. I decided to design my own spreadsheet that factors in the latest dividend that a company has announced as well as the dividend history (i.e. if they tended to pay the same each quarter then I assumed it would stay the same). I've included withholding taxes from the relevant countries (Deloitte has online tax highlights for each country I googled to allow me to figure out the withholding tax for a UK citizen with some degree of accuracy - you have to also factor in the tax treaties).

Some newer shipping companies don't have too much history and some were just impossible to work out such us Petrobras and Rio Tinto so I just estimated (for Rio Tinto, I used a modifier based on last years earnings vs this years earnings and adjusted the div accordingly to the decline in percentage). PBR is just a wildcard - if it pays off, it will compensate for any shortcomings of other stocks. Over the course of the next year, I'll be able to update the data to get an accurate picture of dividend behaviour by each company. I've also started to include some lesser dividend paying stocks that have good reputations such as O and STOR just for some stability (5% of portfolio).

I've added a 10% error modifier that reduces my predicted figure to account primarily for my amateur level of investing knowledge but also for some missed dividends and failed/reduced dividends. My current holdings are showing a yield of just over 10% of my capital and I'm genuinely interested in carrying out this experiment to see what happens over the next year and share the data. The current spreadsheet assumes I don't put another penny into the fund so the final yield is based upon the holdings as of today. I've used a $1.25/£ conversion rate for all transactions. Dividends will be used to buy primarily existing stock as well as some growth stocks I might be bullish over e.g. AMD (Lisa, I love you, please have my babies)

Accordingly, the holdings are ZIM, GOGL, SBLK, EGLE, SHIP, GNK, RIO.L, PBR, STOR, DLG.L with the majority of my cash going into ZIM and GOGL.

Also I didn't go into the risk posed by China as I'm sure everyone already has their own opinion on it. 

Overview-
Baidu describe themselves as a leading AI company with a strong internet foundations. They are essentially the Google of China with an ecosystem of applications. They are the dominant Internet search engine provider in China but over the last 10 years have been investing in AI capabilities and growing the AI segment of there business. 

History-
Baidu's founder Robin Li worked for a US company where he worked on developing better algorithms for search engines for use by the Wall Street Journal. From this beginnings Baidu was incorporated in 2000 by Li and Eric Xu as a search engine. In 2001 they monetised this by allowing advertisors to bid for ad space and then being paid everytime the ad was clicked. 
In 2005 the company listed on the Nasdaq. In 2008 they changed their name from Baidu.com to Baidu Inc. In 2012 Baidu obtained a controlling interest in iQYLI Inc which also trades on the Nasdaq. Baidu has expanded beyond search in recent years and have expanded into AI technology and development. 

Baidu Business-

Search-
Although expanding and looking to transform themselves in providing an AI company Baidu's main way of making money is through advertising. At the core is Baidu app which is China's number 1 search engine with 544 million monthly active Users (MAU) in 2020 as well as Baidu feed which provides users with a personalised time lines based on their interests. They essentially work like Google search directing people to third party websites.
They have an ecosystem of over a dozen apps including Baidu Wiki essentially like Wikipedia. Baidu Knows where users post questions and the public answer, Baidu Post where users post knowledge and experience and provide practical tips. 

Baidu monetised this by selling ad space to advertisers that bid the most for key words used in searches. This makes up the majority of Baidu's revenue. This works where by customers bid for priority placement of their adverts against key word searches so as to reach users who search for related products or services. Customers are then charged on a cost per click basis so it all depends on how attractive and engaging the ads are.

Online marketing revenues in China were approximately $180bn in 2021 with 87% of this being done through mobiles. China has a population of 1.2bn people but only 67% have access to a mobile. As mobile device users grow advertisement and marketing revenues will likely increase with Baidu grabbing a share of this. Marketing in China is a sign of the wider economic health when the macro economy slows the marketing revenues slow as well. In the most recent quarters ad revenues have slowed for all big marketing companies including Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu was one of the best growers at 6%. 

Baidu uses the cash generated by their search their advertising to fund investments into other areas. 

AI Cloud-
Baidu provides Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) which essentially provides computing power, storage, networks etc. Platform as a service (PaaS) which is the hardware and software for development of computer models. Subscription as a Service (SaaS) where they provide software for AI. 

IaaS  allows customer to scale or cut their cloud computing capabilities. While PaaS and SaaS use AI to try and improve operational efficiency of customers by providing them with personalised AI solutions. Baidu has 

They monetise this by providing these solutions to enterprise clients, consumers and the public sector for a lump sum or through a subscription basis. This area is still in its infancy but is growing rapidly at greater than 40% between 2019 and 2020. 

There AI service PaddlePaddle allows customers to customise their own AI solutions thanks to a modular design of solutions,  including algorithms, video analysis, data analysis etc. PaddlePaddle has been an open source system since 2016. The numbers of developers and businesses using PaddlePaddle has grown from 1.9 million users and 84000 businesses utilising it in 2020 to 4.1 million users and 157000 businesses at the end of 2021. Being open source boosts adoption and the more that use it the more improvements and developed it becomes. Essentially a positive feedback loop of development. 

The advantage PaddlePaddle has is its simplicity. Most other software is designed to work in to many situations whereas Baidu has narrowed the potential uses but made it simplistic requiring only a quarter of the code of competitors such as Microsoft CNTK and Amazon DSSTNE. This aims to make it more attractive to potential users. 

Other Growth Initiatives-
Baidu also has a range of other smaller business ideas that they are investing heavily into to drive growth. These are all in their infancy. Some of these initiatives are laid out below but for the purpose of this note the main focus is on the more established search and cloud solutions. 

Intelligent Driving - Baidu is China's leader in autonomous driving supporting level 4 driving and have 8.7 million test miles and operate robotaxi testing along major routes in over 30 cities. They have partnerships with 10 ""leading"" automakers to power their vehicles with maps or their automated valet parking. They have a strategic partnership with Geely China's best selling Chinese automaker brand under the volvo geely brands. 
Their robotaxis have been monetised recently in Beijing in November of 2021 and two other first tier cities in February 2022. Aim is to increase the number of cities and routes with robotaxis and increase monetisation and make profitable over the coming years. 

Baidu Health- A service to allow patients to find the doctors and hospitals that best suit their needs as to improve outcomes. 

iQYLI- The Netflix of China. Not profitable. It's floated on the US market and Baidu owns a 56% stake. 

The Industry-
Baidu competes with companies such as Tencent and Alibaba in terms of cloud computing and compete for traffic, user time, content and marketing resources. 

Baidus advantage is there search engine. It is the biggest in China and has a market share of 85%. The next largest is Bing and Sogou at 4% each. Baidu has a huge competitive advantage - the bigger the user database, the better the algorithm, the better the search results - which is a network effect difficult for competitors to breach. In the world market though Baidu only has a share of 1.6%. 

The issue in China that could damage Baidu is the move away from apps towards a few super apps. Alibaba blocks Baidus Web crawlers meaning no search results pop up for anything Alibaba related products. China’s mobile market is moving away from apps and towards a few super apps such as WeChat and Alibaba, which are creating content ecosystems via mini-programs. Essentially all the apps someone needs under a single umbrella meaning they never need to leave the ecosystem. 

The global market is dominated by Google. If Google get into China they would most likely take over as they are bigger have more resources etc. Google has in the past tried to get into the Chinese Market however the majority of results were censored. In 2018 they had a project to deal with this but came under US political pressure to scrap the project as well as pressure from their own privacy team. I doubt highly Google will try this again any time soon leaving Baidu as the leader. 

They have stiff competition from companies such as Alibaba with regards to cloud computing. Baidu will not be the leader on Chinese cloud computing there's no way given the size of Alibaba and Tencent. But if they can get a decent share of the Chinese Market through offering their AI services this would be a major win in my book. Currently Baidu has a 8.2% share of the Chinese Cloud market and are growing faster than competitors. Again it's highly unlikely international companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon will challenge them in China due to politics. 

In terms of other Growth Initiatives there's no point looking at competition as these are more speculative and I'm concentrating on search. 

Management-
The CEO of Baidu is still the founder Robin Li. I do like an owner CEO as they run it as an owner. Robin Li is also the largest shareholder owning 17% of the company. 
 
Financials-
This is where things actually get difficult. Baidus core revenue is from their online marketing services. Baidu in 2021 had total revenues of $19.5 billion. Of this revenue $14.9 billion was generated by the main core Baidu business and $4.6 billion by iQYLI. Of the core revenues $11.6 billion was from online marketing services up 10% from  2020 and $3.3 billion from non-marketing such as cloud, AI etc an increase of 71% from 2020. 

Net Income in 2021 was $1.6 billion. The true profitability of Baidu is hidden due to their investments in new areas, developing AI and building out their infrastructure requirements. The true profitability of Baidu is likely to be higher.

Balance Sheet-
Baidus balance sheet is a fortress with $28 billion of cash and short term investments and only $9 billion in debt and notes payable. This gives them a net cash position of $19 billion or the equivalent of 45% of their total market cap. 

Cash Flow Statement-
In 2021 Baidu generated free cash flow of $2.4 billion again I don't read to much into this given the amount of investments in other areas.

Valuation-
I'll keep the valuation simple. Given how much of Baidu is unprofitable I'll only value the online marketing revenues generated from the search engine. In 2021 this was $11.6 billion. Baidu started moving away from just their search engine and investing in AI in 2010. So I'll use the net income margins they were generating before 2010 as a basis for the valuation. This net income margin generally fluctuated from 38-45%. For my valuation I'll use a crude multiple of earnings for different income margins
                                                    Margin
Earnings multiple     35%          40%          45%
        10                       $115        $131        $148
        12                       $138        $158        $177
        14                       $161        $184        $207

This crude method gives a value anywhere between $115-207. Add in the $19 billion on the balance sheet equivalent to $53 per share it takes it to a range between $168 and $260. Given that the current price is $119 I believe there is very good value here with a potential 40% upside on the lowest end not accounting for revenue streams other than search. 

This value is purely on the online marketing revenues of Baidu, again, mainly generated through the search engine. So included in this is all the AI, cloud, autonomous driving iQYLI etc. 

Key Economic Metrics to watch-

Non Marketing services growth- This is the growth engine of the business need to see these increase substantially. 

Operating Margin- I'm looking for operating margins to increase as time goes on they're a technology services company so margins should be high. They are still in a growth phase so I want to see margins improving as they improve profitability in thee new areas. Additionally I want to see iQYLI turn profitable or at least nove towards it drastically. 

R&D Expense Returns- R&D expense is really dragging in terms of the earnings and cash flow currently. There R&D expenses are mainly tailored towards there newer growth initiatives. How comes this annual expense stack up against the revenue and  profit they are generating from this area? 

Risks-
The Chinese risk, as stated at the top not going to go into it. 

Failure to monetise new growth initiatives- A lot of Baidu is unprofitable. The search engine drives the profitability but cloud, AI, intelligent Driving and iQYLI are all unprofitable and make up about $8 billion in revenue in 2021 and is totally unprofitable. Especially need to watch iQYLI as it's been unprofitable for several years and isn't showing any concrete progress towards profitability. 

Macroeconomic slowdown- The macro economic slowdown in China could continue to put pressure on marketing budgets reducing the amount marketers are willing to pay for advertisements. This in turn could reduce the revenue and cash generated by the core potentially harming Baidu's ability to invest in their AI and other growth initiatives. Given their balance sheet however I believe they should be able to cover several years of investme to yet. 

Future Plans-
For 2022 there priorities are.

1) For AI Cloud, we aim to sustain above-industry level revenue growth. 
2) For intelligent driving, we will further scale up the Apollo Go operations to provide ride to more passengers. We will steadily work toward the goals of removing the safety drivers and providing fully autonomous ride-hailing services in China.
3) For Xiaodu, we will seek quality revenue growth and margin improvement. Xiaodu has already completed two roundup financing.
4) And for mobile ecosystem, we will continue to leverage AI to improve the user experience in search and feed and further build closed-loop services within Baidu App to fulfill user need. In addition, we focused on a healthy and sustainable business model in order to consistently generate strong cash flow to power our investment in new AI businesses.",2022-03-12,12,27

sjxe8u_NET,NET,Snap shares rocket as much as 62% on first-ever quarterly net profit,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/snap-q4-2021-earnings.html

Snap reported its first quarterly net profit on Thursday, and beat analyst estimates for the fourth quarter on earnings, revenue and user growth.

The report comes a day after Facebook parent Meta delivered disappointing guidance for the first quarter that dragged down several social media stocks with it. Snap fell 23.6% Thursday prior to its own earnings announcement but popped as much as 62% after hours, before settling up about 52%.

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings per share: 22 cents, adjusted vs 10 cents expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analystsRevenue: $1.3 billion vs $1.2 billion, according to RefinitvGlobal Daily Active Daily Users (DAUs): 319 million vs 316.9 million, according to StreetAccountAverage Revenue per User (ARPU): $4.06 vs $3.79, according to StreetAccount

It also provided a Q1 guidance range of $1.03 billion to $1.08 billion, higher than the $1.01 billion analysts anticipated, according to Refinitiv. It expects daily active users between 328 million and 330 million in the first quarter, beating analyst estimates of 327.8 million, according to StreetAccount.

Snap has to contend with similar headwinds as Meta, which warned that it anticipates a $10 billion revenue hit in 2022 resulting from Apple’s privacy changes on iOS that make it harder to target consumers with advertiser content.

Snap also distributes its app on Apple iPhones and serves advertising content to monetize its business. But Snap’s direct response advertising businesses experienced a recovery from the iOS changes “quicker than we anticipated,” according to prepared remarks for CFO Derek Anderson for the company’s analyst call.

During the Q&A period, Andersen said that Snap has been mindful to make privacy inherent to its products and as a result, the changes caused by the iOS changes are “likely to be experienced differently for our business than perhaps for others.”

Still, Anderson said in his opening comments that Snap still thinks “it will take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to build full confidence in our new measurement solutions.”

Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman said in her prepared remarks that the sales team is helping advertisers transition through the changes. Gorman said advertisers who tend to focus on “lower funnel goals” like in-app purchases have been most impacted and some have migrated to “mid-funnel goals” like installs or clicks, where there’s greater visibility despite the iOS changes.

Andersen also pointed to macroeconomic forces like supply chain disruptions and labor challenges impacting advertisers and impacting Snap’s brand advertising sector, specifically.",2022-02-03,130,44

 In this category there are pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds etc. In my understanding these companies hold significant long cash positions and so they would mainly short futures to hedge against risks of underlying stocks, which should result in a short hedging position (net short).

I haven't used FCF much so far and got some feedback in this sub that I should.

I'm looking into financial statements for $GOOGL, $MSFT and $UHS on marketwatch.

And I'm trying to understand what is going on, so I have on these examples:

1. For $GOOGL [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl/financials/cash-flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl/financials/cash-flow)  
in 2018, Net Income Growth 142.74% while at the same time FCF growth -4.50%, can someone explain to me from the financial results what actually happen in 2018, how to read it from the balance sheet?
2. $GOOGL has a stock based compensation, is it included in the cash flow? If not, than FCF is seriously screwed metric for these megacaps.  
3. For $UHS [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uhs/financials/cash-flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uhs/financials/cash-flow)   
net income growth was: 15.13% while at the same time Free Cash Flow Growth 102.50%, from the financial statements, how this big discrepancy happen?

q0pz1k_NET,NET,"Selling options (CSPs) this week, here are my plays and the reasoning behind it: MARA, PLTR, NET, SPCE.","I usually post my ""buy-the-dip"" plays, but with this temporary increase in volatility I'm getting back into selling options, CSPs to be specific. For those that have been following on my journey I've posted all my plays over the last 2 months. Here are this week's picks and the reasons behind the trade.

# What am I selling this week?

I've looked at IV lists and charts and here are some plays that offer returns of my liking this week. Remember, I am not interested in ""getting rich quick"" through the market. This is a place where patience is rewarded and I am happy with a 10% quarterly gain. Those who seek fast returns are usually humbled by the market through a swift loss of capital.

&#x200B;

**Marathon (MARA)**

https://preview.redd.it/cax9jjp2oar71.png?width=2510&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb337af5738f4c180670e594d6be6eb1479dd9ba

Est. IV: 80%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $32, Nov 5th, 2021.

Return: $3 for $300 premium, 9% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $29, full profit above $32.

Details: If MARA stays above $29 in 5 weeks, the position remains profitable. MARA already in over-sold category as a proxy for crypto. Next support is around the $23 level. Keep an eye on crypto as this crypto miner will follow prices accordingly.

&#x200B;

**Palantir (PLTR)**

https://preview.redd.it/hb95fu23oar71.png?width=2522&format=png&auto=webp&s=19827708ec654c4980d5519e59e72754ae8d9c81

Est. IV: 55-60%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $24 strike, Nov 5th 2021

Return: $1.35 for $135 premium, 5.6% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $22.65, full profit above $24.

Details: Palantir almost broke out past $30 two weeks ago. The stock price has dropped nearly 20% just last week. IMO good risk-reward at these levels. If I get assigned I would have a cost-basis of $22.65 which would still be a solid entry.

&#x200B;

**Cloudfare (NET)**

https://preview.redd.it/rfa23je3oar71.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfeee807a2b8b1d2ead7339f458f31487fc87b3d

Est. IV: 50%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $110, Nov 5 2021

Return: $5.25 for $525 in premium, 4.8% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $104.75, full profit above $110.

Details: NET was on a solid uptrend until last week where it broke through the 50 EMA. I am looking for a bounce off the 200 EMA (current level). To be safe I might sell the $110 strike for a bit more cushion. Stock price is $115 and should I get assigned my cost basis will be \~$105.

&#x200B;

**Virgin Galactic (SPCE)**

https://preview.redd.it/m7z8vzt3oar71.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6596bf2fa442d6adbfe4d387c7e9d19dbf3c3d

Est. IV: 50%

Put Option Strike/Expiration: $22 strike, Nov 5 2021

Return: $1.55 for $155 in premium, 7% return on risk.

Break-Even Price: $20.45, full profit above $22.

Details: The SPCE chart is something else and seem to be a repeating pattern. In my opinion we could be at the lows with the potential for a squeeze to the upside. This stock seems to take off on social sentiment often and as the option is short-dated and rip to the upside will allow us to maximize profit quickly.",2021-10-03,33,8

Yesterday I think I found the problem. My Open PL is huge... and negative! So while I'm showing a Net Profit of $135,000 my Open PL is -$108,000. To calculate the total value of my portfolio, based on the current price of BTCUSD, would I subtract the latter from the former, leaving $27,000? (Some of that would be cash and some would be the current value of the coins I purchased, right?)

Strangely, one coin I looked at shows a very small net LOSS. But I just noticed that the Open PL is  $2.3 million. So does that mean that I didn't make any profits... but my portfolio, based on the current price of Doge, is 2.3 million? That can't possibly be right...",2021-07-23,4,2

o16nm2_NET,NET,Just a reminder that the current market cap of SPRT is 100M and the company is holding 40M net cash + 39M of other assets,"We all wait for the exact date of the merger that will happen in the upcoming third quarter this year but till then, let me tell you another reason why SPRT is incredibly undervalued right now.

I already wrote about the huge potential of the support.com and greenidge merger here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nzju1k/supportcom\_sprt\_upcoming\_merger\_and\_other\_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/nzju1k/supportcom_sprt_upcoming_merger_and_other_good/)

And I already compared Greenidge with its main competitors here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/o0l0ra/i\_compared\_sprt\_with\_its\_two\_main\_competitors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/o0l0ra/i_compared_sprt_with_its_two_main_competitors/)

After those two reads, that are 100% based on hard facts everybody can look up with the company sources provided, it should be abundantly evident, that this stock needs to go up.

But today I want to focus on another point.

support.com alone is holding 40M USD net cash right now. This is not combined with greenidge (this will sum up to over 70M), but just support.

&#x200B;

If we do the math now for Q1 2021 and break this down to the net cash by share, it will look like this:

[for every stock out there, the company owns 1.34 USD in net cash](https://preview.redd.it/tw8lem7b2n571.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca4fbd193498e23c8c49673e47efa6db67bf9a3)

In case you need a reminder what net cash is. Net cash is the actual money that sits in the company after all taxes and liabilities are subtracted.

This does of course not include all the other assets the company owns, like real estate, hardware and all that other stuff. The total assets are another 39M USD.

|NET CASH|TOTAL ASSETS|COMBINED VALUE|
|:-|:-|:-|
|40M USD|39M USD|**79M USD**|

&#x200B;

This means that from the current market cap of 100M USD, 79M USD of that are the pure assets and cash the company has right at hand. After taxes, liabilities and everything. If you would buy the company you could literally sell just the stuff in there and take the money and you will end up with 79M USD.

Imagine that. This does not include the intellectual property, the business relations, the customer data, the future profits and of course not even remotely the upcoming merger with Greenidge. Think about that.

&#x200B;

**Again, this stock is so much undervalued its insane.**

&#x200B;

All of the data I used here for this calculation is out there and is not including any future roadmaps or fantasy dollars. Its based on Q1 2021 company data. Check out the source and let us talk about how this is even possible.

The stock was up nearly 3000% at its peak today. Some aggressive profit taking (myself included) at end of day has actually brought it back down to what may be an attractive entry price tomorrow morning.

Risks are that people don’t want to slap a stock that’s up 1xxx% or the financials could be totally bullshit.  But if they are accurate this stock is insanely undervalued.

I’ll be watching for volume and price movement in the first 20-30 minutes of market open tomorrow to see if it’s worth diving back in for another day/swing trade.

Disclosure: I day traded this stock from $.07 and sold at various levels from $.14 to $.50 today.  I’m still holding a few shares but honestly looking to add tomorrow after that EOD selloff.

Edit: I am not long on this stock after today.  I simply think tomorrow may provide another opportunity to day trade it.

mw62tv_NET,NET,Ozop Energy ($OZSC) Announces the Supplying of Equipment for First Near Net Zero Microgrid,"> WARWICK, N.Y., April 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. (OZSC), (""Ozop"" or the ""Company""), has announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Ozop Energy Systems (OES) has received its initial order for a microgrid generator system for a first-of-its-kind near Net Zero Microgrid building solution. These near Net Zero Microgrids provide the three key benefits driving the paradigm shift to distributed generation: cost savings, carbon reduction and resiliency.
> 
> The near Net Zero Microgrid is for a commercial office building located at 7250 Parkway Drive, Hanover Maryland. This innovative microgrid project involves a 700kwh Eos Energy battery storage solution, a 350kw PSI natural gas generator, a 65kW AC solar photovoltaic system, two EV Charging stations from ChargePoint a deep retrofit of the interior lighting and plug loads, high efficiency motor replacements and new variable frequency drives. When fully operational the combined energy efficiency improvements of the microgrid will save more than $4,000,000 over the 20+ year life of the project as well as 1,279,290 kWh annually, dramatically reducing the building's overall carbon footprint. The near Net Zero Microgrid project will enable the building to remain fully operational in the event of an electricity grid failure as well as to participate in Demand Response programs.
> 
> The funding for the $3.7 million near Net Zero Microgrid project was provided by Counterpointe Sustainable Real Estate, an affiliated company of Hannon Armstrong (NYSE: HASI), and a leader in Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) financing. The C-PACE loan term from Counterpointe Sustainable Real Estate is for twenty years and the first payment will be made via the special property tax assessment in September 2021. The project is also a beneficiary from a Maryland Energy Administration grant as well as federal Investment Tax Credits.
> 
> OES will be providing approximately $600,000 of energy generation, storage and switchgear for this near Net Zero Microgrid project, which is to be the first of several near Net Zero Microgrid projects it will be supplying equipment to in the near future. Grid Energy and Masterplanning, LLC (""GEMM""), with whom OES has a strategic alliance, is the Construction Manager on the 7250 Parkway near Net Zero Microgrid project. With nearly 30 salespeople throughout the United States, GEMM anticipates construction managing more than $10 million of similar microgrid projects in 2021, and it will be using OES as its Equipment Purchasing Agent for this work.
> 
> Office space is a prime candidate for efficiency improvements and C-PACE. Offices require large amounts of electricity and water for lighting, climate control, and powering appliances necessary for business operations. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), office space was the second highest commercial user of electricity of which lighting was the largest single contribution. The potential for energy savings is clear and C-PACE helps to realize energy efficiency retrofits through providing funding for capital intensive projects immediately and with a deferred payback period that can mirror the estimated useful life of the installed improvements. The 7250 Parkway near Net Zero Microgrid project is a prime example of how C-PACE funding can be used for both cost savings, resiliency and significant carbon reduction.
> 
> ""This is an exciting step in Ozop's core strategy to be a leading equipment supplier to the distributed generation space. The 7250 Parkway near Net Zero Microgrid project uses state-of-the-art equipment and controls and as such is one of the 'bleeding edge' solutions that is providing sustainability to the built environment"", said Brian Conway CEO of Ozop Energy Systems. ""We are proud to be part of a microgrid team that includes such leading companies as CounterpointeSRE/Hannon Armstrong, Eos Energy Storage and ChargePoint. Ozop looks forward to continued growth in its Equipment Distribution business and in particular rapidly expanding its product offerings to the dynamic microgrid sector.""

Let's say O is riddled down to 50 bucks a share due to (likely temporary) interest rate hikes or whatever concern, but their dividend is not decreased. Doesn't that make the security even more enticing since these kinds of shares aren't really meant to be sold?

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
>  
>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&#x200B;

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

&#x200B;

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&#x200B;

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon

ip2ki8_NET,NET,"Beware, traders. How I tripled my net worth and lost it all within 1 month on Binance Futures.","To start, I'll introduce myself. I'm a 19-year-old college student and I've been investing in cryptocurrency and trading forex for the last 3 years. I was drawn to trading for all the wrong reasons. I wanted fast money. I wanted a thrill. I wanted to gamble.

In mid-July, I invested in Swipe (SXP). The DeFi craze was just getting started and SXP seemed like a front-runner with an amazing project. I bought a small amount around $0.60 and watched it triple within a week or two. Yet, at $1.80, people still thought the token was heavily undervalued, including me. This is when I decided to first try out Binance Margin and Futures.

Futures are very similar to leverage trading on forex, so I felt semi-comfortable with what I was doing. I spent about $400 to open up a 7000 SXP long near $1.40 during a flash dip. For those of you that followed SXP, I'm sure you know what happened. My position went green immediately and never looked back. Over the next 2 weeks, SXP climbed to just over $5. I held my position the entire time. At its peak, my $400 worth of margin was worth $27,000.  I was euphoric. It was the most money, by far, I'd ever had in my life. I started dreaming of achieving financial independence before 20. 

But then, SXP started going down. Fast. I closed out at $4.20, sitting on around $22k. And what did I do? I immediately opened up another long. A much larger position. I wanted to reach 6 figures on this run. I got liquidated quickly, bought back in at $4, then $3.70, then $3.50. All liquidated. I decided to throw my last $14,000 on a 22,000 SXP long. And once that got liquidated too, I was about $8,000 underwater. Not only did I lose all my paper profit, but I also lost the majority of the money I had been saving for years.

I was crushed. I didn't know what to do with myself. I started transferring whatever money I could get my hands on into my futures account. I started being reckless, hoping to hit big again like before. I became more reckless with my money than I ever have and quickly lost that too. This time the losses felt different. I was numb to them. My $1000 losses felt like nothing compared to what I had already lost, even though that $1000 was now a bigger % of my net worth than it ever had been. 

In summary, my greed got the best of me. And I lost so much that I didn't give a shit about anything anymore. I hope this story will help other traders avoid the mistakes I made.

Btw, I opened up one last long at $1.70. Gonna ride it up to $8.

*Why was this company on my list?*

When looking for net-nets (companies selling for less than their current assets - liabilities), I came across Hermes.

With the share price drop, they are now trading at less than 1/3 of the net-net value.

*What's the situation?*

The company appears to me to be a 'cash shell', though I have no insight into the management's strategy and I could be wrong. Cash shells are defined as companies with no operating business that are used to provide an easy route to the stock market for other companies.

Regardless of the management's intention, the company appears to have done nothing but burn £100k per year for several years. The market cap is just under £1M and it has £3.6M in cash with virtually no other assets or liabilities.

The obvious course of action to me right now to maximise shareholder value would be for the company to dissolve and distribute the money to the shareholders. 86% of shares are 'not in public hands', so assuming they are all owned by the directors, 86% of £3.6M today seems a lot better than slowly drawing £100k per year, which makes me think they're not doing this to just slowly bleed the company dry. The only reason, then, I can think of for the current course of action is that management genuinely believe they'll provide greater returns to shareholders by waiting for the right reverse merger opportunity to come along.

I have no experience with cash shells or net-nets and would be very keen to hear thoughts or links to research from anyone with experience in this area.",2020-04-14,35,29

fr1rsd_NET,NET,Direction Play: Net Short via Puts for mid April,"**Short-term Bull Case**

Fund rebalancing will continue on 30th and 31st to close the month/quarter. Probably an additional $300B or so rotation into equities. It's tough to gage this because I'm sure a lot of rebalancing occurred last week, but it's definitely not finished. Some funds may rebalance a bit later on April 1st; we don't really know all of their timelines. JPM is tracking this and initially said fund rebalancing was on the order of $850B for March and as of Friday is about 40%-45% complete. Last week's bull run may not be over, but we'll see this week how the market responds to the virus accelerating in the US.

Our relief rally might extend through Tuesday with some volatility and perhaps peak at SPY 270 where the option market is priced on the upside (we know for certain that there's a lot of selling pressure at 269. High odds of holding, but ultimately we don't know). There's some minimal bets on 290 and 300 because if 270 breaks there's not much in the way to 300 from a technical perspective, but this is low odds.

**Medium-term Bear Case**

On the flip side, as we hit 255-260 last week massive put positions were opened in the 200-220 range for both April and May and I witnessed accumulation at 190 for the first time. Some of this is hedging I'm sure, but there are transactions which are very clearly bearish. There's a lot more put activity on SPY & SPX Apr/May puts, which opened on Thursday & Friday. I can give more examples if needed. For those that think it's all hedging or selling, that's not the case. It's pretty easy to identify bear put spreads or larger directional plays. It doesn't make much sense to hedge in 50,000 lots, so these transactions are more obvious. Of course, hedges themselves are bearish because the longs believe there's a significant chance of a retest.

As the buying pressure lets off by Apr 1, we'll get the next week of jobless claims on April 2 and unemployment data on April 3rd. We may or may not sell off in advance of these events on April 1st, but regardless I'm very confident that Apr 1-3 will be net negative and likely begin the trend towards a retest of March lows. As we continue in April, the coronavirus will continue to ravage and spread across the US where we start seeing most hospitals in several major US cities overwhelmed and infection/death statistics hitting new highs. Sadly, it looks to me like the US healthcare system is less prepared than countries in Asia and US demographics are at much higher risk of death than populations in Asia. In two weeks from now, call it Apr 11, we'll likely see 2,000 deaths per day and over 4m infections (total count, which includes millions not tested). It's difficult for people to comprehend the exponential function of the virus spread but the growth factor in US is about 1.25 and Trump has no plans to institute a nation-wide lockdown for 6-10 weeks so the virus will flourish (all countries which halted the spread initated nation-wide lockdowns). And last of all, there's many buyers thinking this is a bottom, indicating it's not, and massive long-only funds are not going all-in. They are merely cherry picking a few names and dipping their toe in. Pretty soon these bull events will be priced in and the negative news will rain down in mid April.

**Positions**

Playing April puts is still quite risky and very expensive so I take a pass on that. I've been building put positions for 5/15 in the range of 200-230 and the same for SPX 2000-2200. This is conservative enough for me. I considered June with lower IV, but my research points to something happening in mid April so paying a theta premium for June didn't make sense even though the vol is cheaper. I also think markets tend to react *before* something happens so I think May gives enough time. If SPY rose to 270 and VIX fell to say 50-55 then I would certainly jump on some June puts, perhaps even 230P or 240P; but this is low odds. In this market a VIX in the 40s is very cheap (3%-4% moves when realized vol is 5%-7%, even 9%-12%) and VIX in 50s is quite reasonable; arguably cheap as well since we haven't bottomed and MM are short gamma causing extreme swings.

I'm long puts and long equity, but net short. I keep my option strategies fairly simple and focus more on the research side. I think a bear put spread is good idea for a short position or just long puts if you can time it right (buy low) and willing to take the risk of losing 60%-80%. But the upside on these is more like 100%-200% which is why I'm playing them. There's a pretty massive put spread opened March 20 around 11:10am for 80k contracts on APR17 puts. Long APR17 235P 80k at 12.46, short APR17 210P 80k at 5.44 for a debit of around 55m expiring 4 weeks out. The 210P also had 30k-50k lots purchased as the market fell on March 26th, closing out a huge OI of 254k contracts. The most unusual option activity I found was on March 25 and 26: SPY OCT16 260P 230,000 contracts opened for $700m.

I only buy OTM options to use gamma to my advantage. I try to avoid near-the-money and deep OTM, which is why I'm avoiding <200 and >240.

**Risk**

This market is definitely headed lower to retest March lows. Where I can be wrong is the timing. A true bottom might only form in May or June depending on how events develop, namely 1) the virus 2) solvency

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Thank you for the positive feedback. Since this post is well received, I'll try to answer some of your questions and provide further analysis.

**Effects of the option market on the underlying**

Market makers hedge when they are short options. Large blocks of option transactions have material impacts on the underlying because market makers must delta hedge those positions. It's pretty simple to remember: if you open a new long position of an option contract, the seller takes the short side of that option, so to hedge the seller must take the long/short of the underlying. E.g.

&#x200B;

|You buy calls (+)|MM buys shares (+) to hedge|
|:-|:-|
|You buy puts (-)|MM shorts shares (-) to hedge|

And when these positions unwind (close) the opposite effect takes form. This has a sudden material impact when large funds are buying and selling 1k, 5k, 10k, 30k, 50k lots.

**Technical Analysis: My Opinion (debatable)**

There is some legitimacy to technicals, which is why funds pay 200k+ salaries for technical analysts. Technicals work best when the greatest number of people believe them, so major technicals are most reliable. Things like volume, RSI, 200-day MA, 200-week MA, historical bottoms (major support lines), retracements. That’s about all the TA that I follow and it only forms a small part of my analysis, specifically for when to enter/exit after I’ve completed fundamental analysis on direction. When I say most reliable I mean they work >50% of the time but nowhere near 100. Don't forget, many algos are programmed to trade on technicals. Please avoid any con artists on Youtube drawing lines everywhere with crayons. When the market sold off in Feb & March there was huge uncertainty, so the only thing that was reliable were technicals and that’s what the market fell back on. The market high is 339 and the recent low is 218. A 50% retracement is 278 and as we fell from market highs we saw technicals play an important role in price action as many 50% retracements came to fruition. We don’t have to perfectly retrace at 50%. Since there is so much more fear in the market and perhaps some front-running, it makes sense that we might only retrace 40% (combined with other DD). It’s not just about the numbers, but what events are DRIVING the technicals. You need to combine it with further research.

**Analyzing the other side of the trade: positioning.**

When we hit the short-term bottom at 218-220 the VIX was fading because speculators & hedges were taking profits and starting to go long. This makes complete sense because long options are bets on volatility and if you’re holding puts as the market tanks 30%-34% while the VIX hits all-time highs THIS was your time to sell. I mean if you didn’t sell, what were you waiting for? We saw bullish positions opening in 250, 260, 265, and 270 but the magnitude was far less because these calls were so cheap. So you have puts closing with 10x the value of the calls that were opening and the VIX fades.

As we approach SPY 260 we start to see some call positions closing near 260 and large put positions opening. This provides resistance around 260. The effect would be much, much greater at 270 because most of those APR17 250, 255, 260, 265, 270 calls need to be closed. Many of these call positions cannot remain open because if they were opened in the 220s they have now gone 5x-12x and must be closed as we approach expiry. At the same time, at 260 it’s suddenly a lot cheaper to play the downside or hedge to the downside so new put positions will cause further downward pressure.

On the long equity side, longs will see 1 week returns upwards of 20% at these 260-270 levels so they are likely to take profits because these funds normally salivate over 11% annualized returns. You also have huge ETF/Mutual Fund buying which caused dog shit companies to have dramatic returns last week even though they are still dog shit. This is another point of weakness when sentiment shifts.

**Is this selling over?**

There’s a bit of a lag with some long-term holders getting to the point where they freak out and sell. This is the type that either checks their portfiolo less than once per month or the type that clenches their seat as their portfolio sinks 40% because “you can’t time the markets” and “stocks only go up.” Except the emotion will weigh on them as we fell from 339 to 218, bounce to 260, and will turn in April. Once they realize this isn’t a v-shape recovery the emotion will get to them. In April, many people will get their March statements and clue in that the market is in really bad shape, so there’s more selling to come.

You don’t get the fastest sell off in history and VIX at all-time high unless something is seriously wrong. Complete economic paralyzation, record unemployment, incoming bankruptcies, pandemic uncertainty, oil sector & airline industry blowing up, permanent change to consumer behavior, and record leverage in the financial system do not allow for a quick recovery. It may take some time for this to develop but it’s a decent indicator. Historically, bear markets last closer to 9 months, the median time to return to all-time highs is 2 years, and a market bottom usually forms around 2 months after the VIX peaks. Feel free to fact check these (consider the magnitude of this bear) because I haven’t looked at these stats in awhile. Point is, the market isn’t going to fix itself in April.

**Disclaimer**

EDIT: Just want to add a bit of a disclaimer here if anyone is thinking of acting on this. I'm not here to offer investment advice. I'm just here to share my opinion on what I'm observing in the market, what I am doing as a result, and why I'm doing it. Hopefully I welcome different perspectives on these subjects and constructive criticism. If I mention specific numbers in my post it just means that those numbers hold significance to my analysis but in no way shape or form does it mean we are guaranteed to hit those numbers with accuracy. Maybe the markets crank up to 265 but reverses hard. Maybe oil tanks 20% tomorrow and drags the market with it. Maybe some outlier bear news hits the tape on Monday morning and the bull trend dies. To be successful in trading it's more about risk management, so don't go all-in on trades. Develop a thesis, stick to defined rules, be disciplined. Gradually work into your trades and gradually work out of your trades (or just exit 95% of it if you hit some pre-existing profit goal). Good luck!

I've been watching net flows on MJ just about every day this year. This gives an indication if people are net buying or net selling, regardless of the direction MJ trades at. Even if MJ has been down for the day, the net flows have been positive almost every day this year. It was valued at $1.1B yesterday. 
Do you think this simply means the ETF loaned out a ton of shares to shorts today? or people/institutions were taking profits and exiting the MJ sector? or something else?
This seems very strange, it's more than 10% of the fund in one day. MJ ETF's don't rebalance till mid March so it's definitely not that.

So I pulled up the latest MDA for Goeasy which can also be downloaded [here](http://investors.goeasy.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83047&p=irol-financialreports). 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I got to the following on page 9, and I don't see how this make sense. Revenue minus bad debt expense minus operating expenses does not equal EBITDA. EBITDA minus depreciation and amortization does not equal EBIT. I checked the note indicated, and it was just basically an explanation of IFRS and what EBITDA is. Sorry I am obviously missing something silly here but I cannot seem to understand how these figures work at all. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, for anyone that has the time I recommend reading the write-up on VIC. The writer makes some solid arguments and I did some more research about payday loans industry that seems to really support the argument that now is a decent time to invest in this industry. Obviously I have not been able to independently verify his claims about the financials since I am stuck on this part here.

712mug_NET,NET,"A company that is neither seeking to fund expansion nor in financial distress (net gearing of 0.35x) is seeking capital from the market for ""working capital"" purposes. Is this odd?","Usually a company goes for a recapitalisation exercise either to pare down heavy debt, or to fund major expansions. However, in this case, this company I am looking at has had improving balance sheet health, with its latest net gearing ratio at 0.35x. It also has positive FCF with nothing amiss in the balance sheet or cash flow statements. 

The reason given for the capital raising exercise (on the basis of one rights share for every two outstanding shares held) is to fund working capital and pare down borrowings...but I find it amiss since the company - if anything - is on an upwards recovery trajectory after going through heavy (but ultimately positive) restructuring exercises in the 2010-2012 period. 

So my question is, would this be a peculiar way to go to the market to raise capital? Are there any plausible red flags? 

One thing I can say is that two insiders (the Chairman's daughter, and an executive director) have been buying from the market over the past 3 months. In total they have purchased about 2.5% of the company's outstanding shares off the market. This buying was absent prior to the rights issue announcement. 

There are two ways to look at this. One is that they're buying to support the share price to ensure the rights issue takes place as planned (since usually in my country a stock always declines heavily once there is a rights issue). The other is that they are increasing their interest because they know that the company's fortunes are about to change for the better?

On the second point, it is interesting to note that one of the Executive directors who has 15% stake in the company has committed to over-subscribing for 52% of the rights shares in the scenario that no one else subscribed for a single rights shares. This is called the ""minimum scenario"" in the abridged prospectus. 

Is this something I should be staying away from, or could this be an opportunity to buy in to the company at slightly depressed prices in anticipation of plausible mid-term growth?",2017-09-19,2,5

6l0hee_NET,NET,"When calculating net assets per share, do you include or exclude equity attributable to non-controlling interests?","The equity portion of most companies' financial statements is broken into ""Equity Attributable to Equity Holders of the Parent/Company"" and thereafter ""Non-Controlling Interests"". 

When computing Net Assets Per Share, the formula is simply shareholders equity divided by number of shares outstanding. 

My question is this: Do you or do you not take into account NCI when determining shareholders equity? I have seen it be done both ways. Some companies include NCI, some do not...and I do not understand why this discrepancy exists. The computed NAPS can vary significantly something depending whether NCI is included or not.

6d9zd7_NET,NET,"Do you calculate ""Net Assets Per Share Attributable to Owners of The Company"" simply using the equity value, or removing non-controlling interest from equity?","I'm a bit perplexed here. In the past, I always understood ""Net Assets Per Share Attributable to Owners of The Company"" as (Equity - Non-controlling Interests)/(Number of Outstanding Shares). All the companies - big or small - in my local Malaysian market report it this way. 

However, today I saw AirAsia using the total equity value i.e. including a rather large negative non-controlling interest portion. 

Perhaps I am missing something. It's impossible they are doing it wrongly, since it's one of the most iconic Malaysian company with a substantial foreign shareholding. They must have the best accountants. 

Can somebody please explain why they used the figure of 6,059,854 rather than 8,240,658? Cause as far as I know every other Malaysian company only reports the equity attributable to owners of the parent when they compute the NAPS. 

Thanks!

I've been trying to look at operating income or FCF but I can't figure out what's the pros or cons to this.

What kind of patterns a trader would predict, and what data are they looking at? I'm thinking if we can improve the existing strategy by using neural net to extract patterns.

My understanding is that the company has a minority active position in the subsidiary it is invested in and have to record the percentage of income as part of the company's net income, therefore, removing it would give a more accurate outlook on the company's EPS.

Is my understanding correct / would there be any other situations arise from this net income attributable to non-controlling interest?

Also for financial ratio-wise, would it be better to remove numbers related to non-controlling interest from my calculations?
