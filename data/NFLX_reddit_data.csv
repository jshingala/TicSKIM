1kybejs_NFLX,NFLX,Is Generative AI a Threat or Opportunity for Netflix?,"Netflix is obviously wining the streaming wars. Their basic advantage is they can pay more for better production and still be profitable because they can spread those costs over a larger streaming base then anyone else.



As generative video AI expands, content will likely explode leading to more competition.



Does anyone feel this may erode Netflix's advantage as they lose some of the cost advantage or will it just mean since the cost of production drops they can afford to buy the best of AI content creation and have more and more content in their library?



Put differently content producers can produce more content cheaper and it may be easier to upload that to other platforms or easier to for it to be economical in other ways then selling hte rights to the higest bidder?

I now hold some 0509 calls and am debating whether to hold or sell. My dilemma is this: when NFLX breaks out to new highs, it's like a signal to cash in on short-term gains. I was very excited about the quick profits on the 0425 options. But now, looking at the 0509 options, I'm considering a different scenario. If NFLX continues to ride the wave and stay strong, holding could mean more gains. But I also know that the market is a fickle beast, and I don't want to get trapped if things suddenly change. Can any options traders talk about the pros and cons of holding vs. selling? What are some of the key factors I should be looking at in terms of NFLX's current momentum and the value of these options for the remainder of their lives?

I just had my fattest month in the market‚Äî$62K in gains‚Äîand I‚Äôm here to gloat like a Redditor who just discovered options trading.

HIMS: Started with 1,000 shares at $16, rode that chunky telehealth piggy up to $33, took profits, then reloaded with 2,000 shares at $24. Within weeks, turned $48K into $78K. Sold half, still holding 1,000 shares through earnings, because I expect this thing to go so parabolic it‚Äôll need a prescription for high blood pressure.

Netflix? While you nerds were binge-watching Squid Game again, I was making money. Dropped $9K into calls, flipped them for a $19K gain, and trimmed 20 shares out of my 100 to lock in some more profits. All this inside my Roth, except for 700 shares of HIMS and the Netflix calls, because I like to keep some risk where Uncle Sam can‚Äôt touch it.

Best play of the year? RIVIAN. Scooped 2,000 shares around $12, and this thing is gearing up like a Tesla owner explaining why gas is a scam.

Total haul? $62K in gains. And with all these HIMS profits, I have so much Viagra I could go round-for-round in a gay bear orgy and still have enough left to keep the entire subreddit‚Äôs dads awake at night.

May your losses be porn-worthy and your gains be legendary.

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That‚Äôs double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million‚Äîan all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words:¬†*Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix‚Äôs mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyonc√© halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren‚Äôt just for cable anymore.

Netflix‚Äôs pivot to live programming isn‚Äôt just about engagement‚Äîit‚Äôs also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it‚Äôs a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it‚Äôll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love‚Äîthink¬†*Stranger Things*,¬†*Wednesday*, and big-budget films like¬†*Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix‚Äôs final quarterly subscriber report‚Äîit‚Äôll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture‚ÄîStargate‚Äîaimed at building the U.S.‚Äôs AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate‚Äôs Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman are betting big on America‚Äôs AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture ‚Äúa golden opportunity.‚Äù

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn‚Äôt the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank‚Äôs 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn‚Äôs Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Trump‚Äôs AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution‚Äîor another case of overpromised returns.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the US Leading Indicators report is set to drop, combining data from multiple sources like the Labor Department and Census Bureau to offer a forward-looking view of the economy. Unlike most reports that focus on past performance, this one aims to forecast potential shifts, giving investors a heads-up on possible trends or disruptions ahead.

On the earnings front, it‚Äôs a packed day with major players like Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ), Procter & Gamble ($PG), Abbott Laboratories ($ABT), and Halliburton ($HAL) all reporting. Among the long list of updates, two key earnings reports stand out and are worth closer attention.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* **Travelers Companies**¬†often flies under the radar during earnings season, but this time, all eyes are on the insurer after the devastating LA wildfires. Investors are eager to see how much the company will have to shell out for claims, though its solid financial standing should cushion the blow. Analysts expect $6.26 EPS on $11.04 billion in revenue. ($TRV)

# After Market Close:¬†

* After the bell,¬†**Discover Financial Services**¬†will take the stage as it moves closer to closing its massive $35.3 billion acquisition of Capital One. The deal, once seen as a regulatory long shot, now seems more feasible under the new Trump administration. Investors will be listening for updates on the acquisition and how Discover plans to stay ahead of rising fintech rivals like Affirm Holdings. Consensus stands at $3.26 EPS on $4.39 billion in revenue. ($DFS)",2025-01-22,11,0

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That‚Äôs double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million‚Äîan all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words:¬†*Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix‚Äôs mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyonc√© halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren‚Äôt just for cable anymore.

Netflix‚Äôs pivot to live programming isn‚Äôt just about engagement‚Äîit‚Äôs also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it‚Äôs a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it‚Äôll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love‚Äîthink¬†*Stranger Things*,¬†*Wednesday*, and big-budget films like¬†*Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix‚Äôs final quarterly subscriber report‚Äîit‚Äôll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture‚ÄîStargate‚Äîaimed at building the U.S.‚Äôs AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate‚Äôs Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman are betting big on America‚Äôs AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture ‚Äúa golden opportunity.‚Äù

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn‚Äôt the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank‚Äôs 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn‚Äôs Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Trump‚Äôs AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution‚Äîor another case of overpromised returns.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the US Leading Indicators report is set to drop, combining data from multiple sources like the Labor Department and Census Bureau to offer a forward-looking view of the economy. Unlike most reports that focus on past performance, this one aims to forecast potential shifts, giving investors a heads-up on possible trends or disruptions ahead.

On the earnings front, it‚Äôs a packed day with major players like Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ), Procter & Gamble ($PG), Abbott Laboratories ($ABT), and Halliburton ($HAL) all reporting. Among the long list of updates, two key earnings reports stand out and are worth closer attention.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* **Travelers Companies**¬†often flies under the radar during earnings season, but this time, all eyes are on the insurer after the devastating LA wildfires. Investors are eager to see how much the company will have to shell out for claims, though its solid financial standing should cushion the blow. Analysts expect $6.26 EPS on $11.04 billion in revenue. ($TRV)

# After Market Close:¬†

* After the bell,¬†**Discover Financial Services**¬†will take the stage as it moves closer to closing its massive $35.3 billion acquisition of Capital One. The deal, once seen as a regulatory long shot, now seems more feasible under the new Trump administration. Investors will be listening for updates on the acquisition and how Discover plans to stay ahead of rising fintech rivals like Affirm Holdings. Consensus stands at $3.26 EPS on $4.39 billion in revenue. ($DFS)",2025-01-22,9,0

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That‚Äôs double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million‚Äîan all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words:¬†*Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix‚Äôs mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyonc√© halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren‚Äôt just for cable anymore.

Netflix‚Äôs pivot to live programming isn‚Äôt just about engagement‚Äîit‚Äôs also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it‚Äôs a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it‚Äôll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love‚Äîthink¬†*Stranger Things*,¬†*Wednesday*, and big-budget films like¬†*Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix‚Äôs final quarterly subscriber report‚Äîit‚Äôll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture‚ÄîStargate‚Äîaimed at building the U.S.‚Äôs AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate‚Äôs Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman are betting big on America‚Äôs AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture ‚Äúa golden opportunity.‚Äù

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn‚Äôt the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank‚Äôs 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn‚Äôs Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Trump‚Äôs AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution‚Äîor another case of overpromised returns.

1i7omel_NET,NET,Why $MGNI Will Soar After $NFLX‚Äôs Blowout Earnings Yesterday,"So after I posted my YOLO on Magnite this morning, some of you mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful for me to drop a DD. Buckle up, my friends‚Äî why I'm long Magnite $MGNI

(Although for some reason I don‚Äôt think of them as ‚ÄúMagnite‚Äù in my head, I say it at Magini or Maggie because that how the ticker sounds lol)

Anyway, let me explain why I think it‚Äôs time to load the boat on shares of this company, and especially how it‚Äôs a play to cash in on the blowout earnings report from Netflix $NFLX yesterday.



# The Play: Buying $MGNI on takeaways from $NFLX‚Äôs blowout quarter yesterday

Obviously, the smart money move isn‚Äôt to wait for a stock to go up to buy it. It‚Äôs to buy when news comes out that you *know* will positively impact future earnings or another company in the sector/industry.¬†

Magnite has been crushing it with partnerships (Disney, Netflix, Samsung, FIFA, and United Airlines are outlined below), and the holiday season being during Q4 means CTV ad spend went through the roof.

Think about it: over the holidays, what were you and your family doing? Watching Disney/Netflix? Streaming sports? Magnite powers the ads you see on those platforms. Now, they‚Äôre set to rake in massive revenue from the holiday season.



# Why Netflix's Q4 Success Signals Big Wins for Magnite üöÄ

Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in the ad-supported streaming market‚Äîa sector Magnite ($MGNI) dominates. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. Ad Tier Adoption Surges: 55% of Netflix‚Äôs new subscribers in ad-supported markets chose the ad tier, doubling Netflix‚Äôs ad revenue YoY in 2024 and projected to double again in 2025. This expands the addressable market for connected TV (CTV) advertising tech, where Magnite is the clear leader.
2. Magnite's Market Leadership: As the world‚Äôs largest independent sell-side advertising platform, Magnite already earns \~50% of its revenue from CTV and expects to grow that segment by 15% or more annually. Their platform is projected to generate billions in ad spend over the coming years, aligning with Netflix's growth trajectory.
3. Publisher Monetization Boom: Netflix‚Äôs success in monetizing its ad tier proves advertisers want premium CTV inventory. Magnite specializes in helping publishers monetize content, benefiting directly from this growing demand.

Netflix‚Äôs stellar results confirm that ad-supported streaming is here to stay, creating a massive tailwind for Magnite. $MGNI is poised to ride this wave of growth.



# Facts & Data: Magnite‚Äôs Tailwinds üå¨Ô∏è

1. **$25 Billion+ TAM for CTV Advertising -** The connected TV market is exploding, and Magnite is sitting at the center of it all. They‚Äôre the world‚Äôs largest independent sell-side advertising platform, making them the key player for streaming ad monetization.

   * Monetizing College Football live streams on ESPN.

# Financials: A Strong Foundation 

* **Q3 2024 Performance**:
   * Revenue: $162M (+8% YoY)
   * Net Income: $5.2M¬†
   * Adjusted EBITDA: $50.6M
   * CTV contribution ex-TAC: $64.4M (+23% YoY)
* **Q4 2024 Earnings Expectations**:With the holiday season and their partnerships firing on all cylinders, expect significant upside.¬†

# Simple Explanation: How Magnite Works 

Ever watched a show on Netflix and seen an ad? That‚Äôs where Magnite comes in. They‚Äôre the tech backbone that connects advertisers with streaming services. Think of them as a digital middleman, making sure the right ads get to the right people, at the right time. For every transaction, Magnite earns a fee.

# Why $MGNI Will Pop 

1. The **Netflix & Disney partnerships** will help fuel this, in addition to other recent partnership announcements outlined above. Both streaming giants are leaning heavily into ad-supported models, with Magnite‚Äôs platform as their backbone.
2. The holiday season drove massive engagement on CTV platforms. Think family binge-watching sessions and College Football bowl games.
3. Magnite‚Äôs **tech leadership** is cementing its dominance in CTV, digital display, and mobile advertising.



**TL;DR**

Netflix‚Äôs earnings yesterday made one thing clear: the future of ad-supported streaming is booming, and Magnite is perfectly positioned to capitalize. Operating in a sector with a $25B+ TAM, blockbuster partnerships, and surging CTV growth, $MGNI is a no-brainer with only a $2.3B market cap.

**Position:** I‚Äôm long like Donkey Kong‚Äî6,330 shares deep. I don‚Äôt mess with calls, but if that‚Äôs your vibe, I‚Äôd go with March calls to play the earnings pop. If anyone wants to throw up a technical analysis of $MGNI, or discuss in the comments, I‚Äôd love to see it (because I don‚Äôt understand that shit).

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That‚Äôs double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million‚Äîan all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words:¬†*Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix‚Äôs mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyonc√© halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren‚Äôt just for cable anymore.

Netflix‚Äôs pivot to live programming isn‚Äôt just about engagement‚Äîit‚Äôs also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it‚Äôs a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it‚Äôll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love‚Äîthink¬†*Stranger Things*,¬†*Wednesday*, and big-budget films like¬†*Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix‚Äôs final quarterly subscriber report‚Äîit‚Äôll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture‚ÄîStargate‚Äîaimed at building the U.S.‚Äôs AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate‚Äôs Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman are betting big on America‚Äôs AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture ‚Äúa golden opportunity.‚Äù

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn‚Äôt the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank‚Äôs 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn‚Äôs Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Trump‚Äôs AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution‚Äîor another case of overpromised returns.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the US Leading Indicators report is set to drop, combining data from multiple sources like the Labor Department and Census Bureau to offer a forward-looking view of the economy. Unlike most reports that focus on past performance, this one aims to forecast potential shifts, giving investors a heads-up on possible trends or disruptions ahead.

On the earnings front, it‚Äôs a packed day with major players like Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ), Procter & Gamble ($PG), Abbott Laboratories ($ABT), and Halliburton ($HAL) all reporting. Among the long list of updates, two key earnings reports stand out and are worth closer attention.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* **Travelers Companies**¬†often flies under the radar during earnings season, but this time, all eyes are on the insurer after the devastating LA wildfires. Investors are eager to see how much the company will have to shell out for claims, though its solid financial standing should cushion the blow. Analysts expect $6.26 EPS on $11.04 billion in revenue. ($TRV)

# After Market Close:¬†

* After the bell,¬†**Discover Financial Services**¬†will take the stage as it moves closer to closing its massive $35.3 billion acquisition of Capital One. The deal, once seen as a regulatory long shot, now seems more feasible under the new Trump administration. Investors will be listening for updates on the acquisition and how Discover plans to stay ahead of rising fintech rivals like Affirm Holdings. Consensus stands at $3.26 EPS on $4.39 billion in revenue. ($DFS)",2025-01-22,11,0

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That‚Äôs double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million‚Äîan all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words:¬†*Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix‚Äôs mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyonc√© halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren‚Äôt just for cable anymore.

Netflix‚Äôs pivot to live programming isn‚Äôt just about engagement‚Äîit‚Äôs also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it‚Äôs a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it‚Äôll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love‚Äîthink¬†*Stranger Things*,¬†*Wednesday*, and big-budget films like¬†*Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix‚Äôs final quarterly subscriber report‚Äîit‚Äôll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture‚ÄîStargate‚Äîaimed at building the U.S.‚Äôs AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate‚Äôs Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman are betting big on America‚Äôs AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture ‚Äúa golden opportunity.‚Äù

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn‚Äôt the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank‚Äôs 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn‚Äôs Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Trump‚Äôs AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution‚Äîor another case of overpromised returns.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the US Leading Indicators report is set to drop, combining data from multiple sources like the Labor Department and Census Bureau to offer a forward-looking view of the economy. Unlike most reports that focus on past performance, this one aims to forecast potential shifts, giving investors a heads-up on possible trends or disruptions ahead.

On the earnings front, it‚Äôs a packed day with major players like Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ), Procter & Gamble ($PG), Abbott Laboratories ($ABT), and Halliburton ($HAL) all reporting. Among the long list of updates, two key earnings reports stand out and are worth closer attention.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* **Travelers Companies**¬†often flies under the radar during earnings season, but this time, all eyes are on the insurer after the devastating LA wildfires. Investors are eager to see how much the company will have to shell out for claims, though its solid financial standing should cushion the blow. Analysts expect $6.26 EPS on $11.04 billion in revenue. ($TRV)

# After Market Close:¬†

* After the bell,¬†**Discover Financial Services**¬†will take the stage as it moves closer to closing its massive $35.3 billion acquisition of Capital One. The deal, once seen as a regulatory long shot, now seems more feasible under the new Trump administration. Investors will be listening for updates on the acquisition and how Discover plans to stay ahead of rising fintech rivals like Affirm Holdings. Consensus stands at $3.26 EPS on $4.39 billion in revenue. ($DFS)",2025-01-22,10,0

Selling naked calls is usually not recommended, but it can work out if - 1. The underlying is not very volatile, 2. You sell far OTM calls, 3. You have an exit strategy. In my case, I guess I did not have #3. I had been in similar situation few times in the past and rolling few weeks out worked well.

`NFLX` had already surged \~12% from the latest earnings and RSI was >70, so I thought a pull back was imminent. I rolled and waited, but the stock kept breaking its resistances and making new ATH almost every other day. The commentary around price target upgrades to 1000 (really? WTH) also did not help. Soon, the unrealized loss reached a value that my brain could not digest and I decided to cut losses after one poor night of sleep. Its highly possible that I would have come out green had I waited, but who knows the future and its very hard when the mind works against you.

**How I am feeling about this loss?**  
I am -30K down from the day I started trading options (f\*\*k). The amount is big and it will take time to recoup the losses. Morale was definitely down for few days.

Don't be over optimistic, even if you have experienced something similar in the past. Months of efforts can go in vain in a short time, especially when the risk is not defined. Have an exit strategy. Hope does not work well with options.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta‚Äôs decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court.¬†

A federal judge ruled that the FTC‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape.¬†

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta‚Äôs decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court.¬†

A federal judge ruled that the FTC‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape.¬†

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta‚Äôs decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court.¬†

A federal judge ruled that the FTC‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape.¬†

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.

1g70krt_AMD,AMD,Constructing an options play on Netflix earnings,"Hi, I'm a software engineer, been dabbling in stocks and options here and there for years, got a little bit more serious in the last couple weeks. Not sure what sub is best to post this in, but wanted to walk you through how I came up with this trade and what I learned. I don't know if everything I say here is accurate, but it's my best understanding of the system at this time. This is a technical essay and somewhat long, but I'll try and make it engaging. I did not use AI to assist in writing this post. I welcome any corrections, questions, or additional things to research.

I knew NFLX was reporting and I wanted to play it. I've gambled calls on earnings before, usually winning, because the money machine was going brrrrrr long before JPow was manning it. I've YOLO'd on NFLX, AMD, and NKE before (like, 2016-2019), this time I wanted to make a more informed bet based on data, so I spent some time with ChatGPT learning about options trading. I'd share the transcript, but since I had uploaded images in it, it's not generating a link. Le sigh!

My conversation, which included both education, having it recommend me moves which I explored, and then charting some actual data, some of which included coding (used Python and Jupyter notebook).

* I pasted data out of the options chain straight out of Yahoo for NFLX for this week, and asked it to tell me whether there's more weight on calls than on puts.
* This led us to a conversation about implied volatility.
* I've struggled with IV, and I found that ChatGPT's explanation is hypertechnical and kinda confusing. I struggle with IV belonging to individual options, not to the underlying, and that the IV expressed has no directional bias. I pressed ChatGPT on this, and admitted that in practice, IV on calls must imply some directional bias, otherwise nobody would be buying them. In hindsight, this might not be true, as call sellers are betting the underlying is going down. In any case, it helped form the foundation of a thesis, by investigating what % move the market was betting on based on IV.

* Next, I pulled more extensive options chain data (which I pulled from Alpaca), and had it give me the code to chart a graph of strikes against IVs, plotting the calls in blue, and the puts in yellow. There was an interesting trend, which I later found out was called IV skew / IV smile. It did look like a frown. While the puts were kinda all over the place, the calls above the strike had a very clear pattern, and they were mostly above 1.3, which ChatGPT told me is unusually high, reflecting unusually high premiums, even for tech (first picture)
* As you can tell from the graph, there was a consistent IV level across strikes from 710 to around 750 (I did this on Wednesday night, before the stock dropped further during the day Thursday).
* I dug in more and understood the IV specified is an annualized number, probably from the time the option was born. But this was 2 days to earnings, so I needed to adjust the IV for the number of days left. This formula was a little weird, but you don't need to know about it or how to do the math, ChatGPT just does it. You have to do some sort of division by 365 and then a multiplication by square root of 2 (for 2 days). Don't ask me why!
* The puts definitely had conviction, which gave me a lot of pause on making a directional play. The calls also had conviction, but more conviction, so I figured the market is betting more strongly on calls than on puts, but not by a huge margin. This reflects the broader market sentiment and analyst ratings, with several bullish and some bearish, some technicals bearish and some bullish, and the volatility in the stock over the last year or two. I had been reading whatever I could find mainly on Stocktwits, which had published a few analysis pieces (from the official source, not from randos).
* I decided to just focus on the calls, and come up with a strategy that bet on the upside, but hedged a bit on the downside. Next is figuring out which options to buy. I didn't want to YOLO wildly out of the money calls and hope I got lucky. I wanted to understand what the call options were betting on. And I wanted a better calculation than the usual, which is averaging an ATM call and put (or whatever the base calculation for what the market move is going to be.
* ChatGPT generated me a graph of the annualized IV alongside the adjusted 2-day-left IV. The original IV was showing something like a 25-20% move. But the 2 day was consistently showing a roughly 3, 4% move across strikes, and I interpretted that to be an upside move (second image). This gave me a baseline: if the options are implying a 3.5% move, I'll interpret this as the move needing to be \_at least\_ 3.5% to be in the money net of premium.

https://preview.redd.it/b9om6m3q0nvd1.png?width=1996&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd73eef8ec377a69bb107437201828637343b456

* I also thought it'd be kinda crazy for the stock to move more than, say, 8%. It was already at ATH, there's a lot of downward gravity from bears, it'd be truly extraordinary if it moved more than that. So this was the range I'd bet on: 4%-8% from Wednesday's close by market open on Friday (post report).
* I also want to think of fundamentals. I've been surprised at finally seeing a couple new seasons of shows I liked, plus everybody I know is watching Love is Blind. Some selection bias because I'm from DC and the latest season is based there, but Netflix has been getting more love in the last few months than prior. I'm thinking they're starting to overcome the hangover from the writers strike.
* Next I tried to figure out how to play this. Because of the bearishness, I'm scared. I thought about trying to play both sides, with a strangle or straddle, but I have seen that fail before - sometimes the stock just doesn't move much. If the report met expectations exactly, it wouldn't move much because the expectation was already priced in. If the report failed expectations, it could be an endless drop, as it did when it dropped 45% when it reported a subscriber loss for the first time ever.
* I explored several different options: a bull call spread, buying a long call, doing a synthetic long, and doing a straddle. I next set out to calculate the risk rewards on these. I'm especially thinking, these premiums are frickin high. A contract with a strike $1 above trading is only $100 in gains, but options on either side were selling from 35 through like 13 (x 100). wild! This meant I was late to the party already, and the high premiums could eat into any profit I'd make. To make up for the high premium, I'd need a move HIGHER than 3.5.

That more or less concludes the part where I was working with ChatGPT, although I used it to verify/validate my thinking, including to explain where my max profit was exactly, and why, and how it would work if it went above that, and what buttons I need to click in my brokerage when.

* To do risk reward calculations, you have to look at the different scenarios possible based on profit and loss zones. A synthetic long is basically a 2x leverage. Unlimited upside, unlimited downside, intriguing, but scary. I compared doing a simple synthetic long with doing a synthetic long and also buying a put lower to hedge, in case shit really hit the fan. But like I said, all the premiums are really expensive, so buying a put would severely eat into profit margins.
* For the bull call spread, you have to determine what happens if the price is below the lower leg, between them, and above them. And you have to understand assignment risk. This is all new to me, I'm just learning it for the first time. I also wanted to plot out the risk reward depending on whether the stock moved down, 4%, between 4 and 8%, and above 8%. This got a little tedious. I probably should've done this within ChatGPT but the transcript was getting long, and that's when it starts to get flakey, slow, dumb, make mistakes, plus I wanted to be able to adjust the parameters easily, and that's much quicker in Excel.
* You can reference the third image, to see the calculations. In short, with the synthetic long, I'd be risking around $8000 in losses (an 8% drop, my established worst case, the inverse of my best case), but if they gained 8%, I'd only be up 5551. This is all for single contracts. That's not great, it's like 1:1.5 reward to risk. I'm looking for something closer to 2:1 reward to risk. With hedging with a put, I selected 635, based on someone I trust told me he's selling 630 puts for income. Here, my max upside was $5076, but my downside was going to be $6500 or more. And still, that's a wide spread, when the stock was at $700. The risk reward is a little better, but the problem was if the stock only went up 4%, id only be up 2300. So I didn't just look at best case worst case, but also medium case worst case. And the potential to gain 2300 but lose 6500 sounded particularly horrendous. So I scratched this off my list.

https://preview.redd.it/4ohh4rkjzmvd1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8456a8d6699a17c7f7afff01166298e732fd4db3

* Next I looked at the bull call spread. The bull spread made a lot of sense to me, and while I didn't like it initially, it made more and more sense to me as far as matching the risk/reward profile I wanted, and the price action I was confident on. My downside had a fixed limit of the net debit, while my upside was the spread between the strikes. I calculated the strikes based on my 4-8% range, and landed on 720/750. Here, my max loss would be my net debit of $800, and my max gain would be around $2200 ($30/share spread less the net debit). These odds I like. Sure, I wouldn't benefit from anything above 750, but the odds of that were low, and on the flip side, I wouldn't lose my shirt no matter how bad the stock tanked. And the break even was good too, only a few points movement, which even if the report wasn't a blowout, we'd be likely to at least make it that far.

So that was it - I constructed the trade. Thursday morning I was double checking my work, ready to make my trade. And I made my trade based on what I came up with the night before.

Whoops. Market was down between 1 and .8%. This should've shifted my spread to 710/750, and possibly because the premiums would be a little lower, and price usually drops right before earnings for a variety of reasons, 710/760.

Anyway, I executed my trade around midday, and the price dipped further from there, so I'm already further out of the money than I wanted to be, and I was a little nervous.

Well, that report dropped after hours. It almost immediately dipped 2.5%, and then had some wild volatility for about an hour, before gapping up in a big way. On Stocktwits, someone said they were going to short 300 shares. SHEESH!!!! People are nuts. Anyway, I go to sleep feeling pretty good.

In the morning I'm freaking out a bit. Pre-market is good and I'm still confident in the trade, but now I'm worried about early assignment. Won't that be bad? WIth the price and the premiums fluctuating violently, do I have to refresh every second? Or... maybe it's better if I get assigned? I don't have too much money in this account, I couldn't buy the underlying. Now the stock is trading in the 760s and im like AHHHHHH IM ABOUT TO GET ASSIGNED AM I GOING TO DIE? Well I didn't get assigned, and then I thought, hmm, maybe it's best if this just closes above 750.. the thing is I didn‚Äôt have much in this account, and probably couldn‚Äôt take an assignment. But ChatGPT insisted that if I get assigned, my broker would automatically liquidate my long call, and I wouldn‚Äôt lose any extra money compared to manually selling. But I also didn‚Äôt want to come below the short call at close because I‚Äôd have to manually close the long call. AND! end of day volatility is so insane! Especially on a friday! What's gonna happen! AHHH!

Meanwhile on Stocktwits, I asked that guy how he's doing, and that I'd be having a heart attack if I was in his shoes. He said he got a bad feeling in AH last night, and covered his short at 722. He said it may have been in part due to my message. Community, y'all!

Anyway, I manually closed the position. I use Merril, and it has a built in thing for spreads, which was new, they've come a long way since years ago when I was dabbling. Actually everything did. There's barchart.com and optionstrat.com... really cool stuff, the tools have really improved by orders of magnitude. In about 6 hours I learned a shit ton about options trading, plus constructed a trade that ended up being almost spot on - it closed at 763, and had I readjusted my position Thursday, I'd have been within a couple bucks of that. So I missed out on about $1300 more worth of gain, but for only risking $800 and walking away with $2200, it was a good day. In short, my worry was that the premiums would still be overinflated or underinflated in various ways, and an initial attempt to close the short call looked like more money than I expected, so I panicked and waited. But everything was exactly as it was supposed to be - the closure was for the spread between strikes less the net debit.

Of course, my uncle is going to take his piece. My uncle, your uncle, same uncle. And I'm in a higher tax bracket. But I figure if I can do 1 of these per week, this could be meaningful income without having to leverage a lot of capital or risk a lot of money. If the premiums work out similarly, it's almost a 3:1 reward, so I could mess up 3 times, be right once, and break even.

Happy hunting!",2024-10-19,2,27

https://preview.redd.it/5nwmx736zmvd1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3bf41de5bb35016ded71568b2f3fa5e3d3ed66c

* Next, I pulled more extensive options chain data (which I pulled from Alpaca), and had it give me the code to chart a graph of strikes against IVs, plotting the calls in blue, and the puts in yellow. There was an interesting trend, which I later found out was called IV skew / IV smile. It did look like a frown. While the puts were kinda all over the place, the calls above the strike had a very clear pattern, and they were mostly above 1.3, which ChatGPT told me is unusually high, reflecting unusually high premiums, even for tech (first picture)
* As you can tell from the graph, there was a consistent IV level across strikes from 710 to around 750 (I did this on Wednesday night, before the stock dropped further during the day Thursday).
* I dug in more and understood the IV specified is an annualized number, probably from the time the option was born. But this was 2 days to earnings, so I needed to adjust the IV for the number of days left. This formula was a little weird, but you don't need to know about it or how to do the math, ChatGPT just does it. You have to do some sort of division by 365 and then a multiplication by square root of 2 (for 2 days). Don't ask me why!
* The puts definitely had conviction, which gave me a lot of pause on making a directional play. The calls also had conviction, but more conviction, so I figured the market is betting more strongly on calls than on puts, but not by a huge margin. This reflects the broader market sentiment and analyst ratings, with several bullish and some bearish, some technicals bearish and some bullish, and the volatility in the stock over the last year or two. I had been reading whatever I could find mainly on Stocktwits, which had published a few analysis pieces (from the official source, not from randos).
* I decided to just focus on the calls, and come up with a strategy that bet on the upside, but hedged a bit on the downside. Next is figuring out which options to buy. I didn't want to YOLO wildly out of the money calls and hope I got lucky. I wanted to understand what the call options were betting on. And I wanted a better calculation than the usual, which is averaging an ATM call and put (or whatever the base calculation for what the market move is going to be.
* ChatGPT generated me a graph of the annualized IV alongside the adjusted 2-day-left IV. The original IV was showing something like a 25-20% move. But the 2 day was consistently showing a roughly 3, 4% move across strikes, and I interpretted that to be an upside move (second image). This gave me a baseline: if the options are implying a 3.5% move, I'll interpret this as the move needing to be \_at least\_ 3.5% to be in the money net of premium.

https://preview.redd.it/b9om6m3q0nvd1.png?width=1996&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd73eef8ec377a69bb107437201828637343b456

* I also thought it'd be kinda crazy for the stock to move more than, say, 8%. It was already at ATH, there's a lot of downward gravity from bears, it'd be truly extraordinary if it moved more than that. So this was the range I'd bet on: 4%-8% from Wednesday's close by market open on Friday (post report).
* I also want to think of fundamentals. I've been surprised at finally seeing a couple new seasons of shows I liked, plus everybody I know is watching Love is Blind. Some selection bias because I'm from DC and the latest season is based there, but Netflix has been getting more love in the last few months than prior. I'm thinking they're starting to overcome the hangover from the writers strike.
* Next I tried to figure out how to play this. Because of the bearishness, I'm scared. I thought about trying to play both sides, with a strangle or straddle, but I have seen that fail before - sometimes the stock just doesn't move much. If the report met expectations exactly, it wouldn't move much because the expectation was already priced in. If the report failed expectations, it could be an endless drop, as it did when it dropped 45% when it reported a subscriber loss for the first time ever.
* I explored several different options: a bull call spread, buying a long call, doing a synthetic long, and doing a straddle. I next set out to calculate the risk rewards on these. I'm especially thinking, these premiums are frickin high. A contract with a strike $1 above trading is only $100 in gains, but options on either side were selling from 35 through like 13 (x 100). wild! This meant I was late to the party already, and the high premiums could eat into any profit I'd make. To make up for the high premium, I'd need a move HIGHER than 3.5.

That more or less concludes the part where I was working with ChatGPT, although I used it to verify/validate my thinking, including to explain where my max profit was exactly, and why, and how it would work if it went above that, and what buttons I need to click in my brokerage when.

* To do risk reward calculations, you have to look at the different scenarios possible based on profit and loss zones. A synthetic long is basically a 2x leverage. Unlimited upside, unlimited downside, intriguing, but scary. I compared doing a simple synthetic long with doing a synthetic long and also buying a put lower to hedge, in case shit really hit the fan. But like I said, all the premiums are really expensive, so buying a put would severely eat into profit margins.
* For the bull call spread, you have to determine what happens if the price is below the lower leg, between them, and above them. And you have to understand assignment risk. This is all new to me, I'm just learning it for the first time. I also wanted to plot out the risk reward depending on whether the stock moved down, 4%, between 4 and 8%, and above 8%. This got a little tedious. I probably should've done this within ChatGPT but the transcript was getting long, and that's when it starts to get flakey, slow, dumb, make mistakes, plus I wanted to be able to adjust the parameters easily, and that's much quicker in Excel.
* You can reference the third image, to see the calculations. In short, with the synthetic long, I'd be risking around $8000 in losses (an 8% drop, my established worst case, the inverse of my best case), but if they gained 8%, I'd only be up 5551. This is all for single contracts. That's not great, it's like 1:1.5 reward to risk. I'm looking for something closer to 2:1 reward to risk. With hedging with a put, I selected 635, based on someone I trust told me he's selling 630 puts for income. Here, my max upside was $5076, but my downside was going to be $6500 or more. And still, that's a wide spread, when the stock was at $700. The risk reward is a little better, but the problem was if the stock only went up 4%, id only be up 2300. So I didn't just look at best case worst case, but also medium case worst case. And the potential to gain 2300 but lose 6500 sounded particularly horrendous. So I scratched this off my list.

https://preview.redd.it/4ohh4rkjzmvd1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8456a8d6699a17c7f7afff01166298e732fd4db3

* Next I looked at the bull call spread. The bull spread made a lot of sense to me, and while I didn't like it initially, it made more and more sense to me as far as matching the risk/reward profile I wanted, and the price action I was confident on. My downside had a fixed limit of the net debit, while my upside was the spread between the strikes. I calculated the strikes based on my 4-8% range, and landed on 720/750. Here, my max loss would be my net debit of $800, and my max gain would be around $2200 ($30/share spread less the net debit). These odds I like. Sure, I wouldn't benefit from anything above 750, but the odds of that were low, and on the flip side, I wouldn't lose my shirt no matter how bad the stock tanked. And the break even was good too, only a few points movement, which even if the report wasn't a blowout, we'd be likely to at least make it that far.

So that was it - I constructed the trade. Thursday morning I was double checking my work, ready to make my trade. And I made my trade based on what I came up with the night before.

Whoops. Market was down between 1 and .8%. This should've shifted my spread to 710/750, and possibly because the premiums would be a little lower, and price usually drops right before earnings for a variety of reasons, 710/760.

Anyway, I executed my trade around midday, and the price dipped further from there, so I'm already further out of the money than I wanted to be, and I was a little nervous.

Well, that report dropped after hours. It almost immediately dipped 2.5%, and then had some wild volatility for about an hour, before gapping up in a big way. On Stocktwits, someone said they were going to short 300 shares. SHEESH!!!! People are nuts. Anyway, I go to sleep feeling pretty good.

In the morning I'm freaking out a bit. Pre-market is good and I'm still confident in the trade, but now I'm worried about early assignment. Won't that be bad? WIth the price and the premiums fluctuating violently, do I have to refresh every second? Or... maybe it's better if I get assigned? I don't have too much money in this account, I couldn't buy the underlying. Now the stock is trading in the 760s and im like AHHHHHH IM ABOUT TO GET ASSIGNED AM I GOING TO DIE? Well I didn't get assigned, and then I thought, hmm, maybe it's best if this just closes above 750.. the thing is I didn‚Äôt have much in this account, and probably couldn‚Äôt take an assignment. But ChatGPT insisted that if I get assigned, my broker would automatically liquidate my long call, and I wouldn‚Äôt lose any extra money compared to manually selling. But I also didn‚Äôt want to come below the short call at close because I‚Äôd have to manually close the long call. AND! end of day volatility is so insane! Especially on a friday! What's gonna happen! AHHH!

Meanwhile on Stocktwits, I asked that guy how he's doing, and that I'd be having a heart attack if I was in his shoes. He said he got a bad feeling in AH last night, and covered his short at 722. He said it may have been in part due to my message. Community, y'all!

Anyway, I manually closed the position. I use Merril, and it has a built in thing for spreads, which was new, they've come a long way since years ago when I was dabbling. Actually everything did. There's barchart.com and optionstrat.com... really cool stuff, the tools have really improved by orders of magnitude. In about 6 hours I learned a shit ton about options trading, plus constructed a trade that ended up being almost spot on - it closed at 763, and had I readjusted my position Thursday, I'd have been within a couple bucks of that. So I missed out on about $1300 more worth of gain, but for only risking $800 and walking away with $2200, it was a good day. In short, my worry was that the premiums would still be overinflated or underinflated in various ways, and an initial attempt to close the short call looked like more money than I expected, so I panicked and waited. But everything was exactly as it was supposed to be - the closure was for the spread between strikes less the net debit.

Of course, my uncle is going to take his piece. My uncle, your uncle, same uncle. And I'm in a higher tax bracket. But I figure if I can do 1 of these per week, this could be meaningful income without having to leverage a lot of capital or risk a lot of money. If the premiums work out similarly, it's almost a 3:1 reward, so I could mess up 3 times, be right once, and break even.

# ASML Cut Its Guidance For Next Year On Chip Sector Weakness

It turns out, even chipmakers have their bad days.¬†

ASML, the key supplier of fancy semiconductor equipment, sent shockwaves through the market this week by slashing its 2025 sales expectations earlier this week. The result? A brutal $420 billion wipeout across chip stocks in the U.S. and Asia. Why? ASML reported receiving just half the orders analysts expected, catching everyone off guard.

**The Crown Jewel of Chipmaking**¬†  
ASML is no small fry‚Äîit‚Äôs the only company that produces the coveted ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, the $200 million beasts responsible for making cutting-edge chips that power AI programs and smartphones.¬†

Despite hopes that the AI boom would save the day, it wasn't enough to counteract sluggish demand from the automotive and industrial sectors. Even ASML‚Äôs big-name clients like Intel and Samsung have felt the pinch from disappointing sales.

**China‚Äôs Chip Dilemma**¬†  
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, ASML‚Äôs biggest market‚ÄîChina‚Äîis in for a rough ride. New export restrictions mean ASML can‚Äôt sell its DUV machines, a crucial component for chipmaking, to Chinese companies. That‚Äôs a problem, considering nearly half of ASML‚Äôs Q2 sales came from China, with companies scrambling to snag equipment before the restrictions kicked in.¬†

Now, with the market drying up, ASML has some serious challenges ahead.

**What‚Äôs Next? Cloudy Skies for Chips**¬†  
Even as the dust settles, ASML‚Äôs woes aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. The broader chip industry continues to struggle, and while AI demand remains strong, it‚Äôs not enough to fix the inventory issues plaguing other sectors.¬†

With 2025 expectations lowered and no quick fixes in sight, ASML‚Äîand the entire chip market‚Äîare in for a chippy ride.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The housing market is serving up a double feature this week. First on deck: US housing starts, showing how many single-family homes broke ground last month. August clocked in at 1.36 million starts‚Äîthe highest since April‚Äîwhile experts predict September will land pretty close at 1.35 million.

Then we‚Äôve got building permits, aka the green light for future construction. August saw a 4.9% jump to 1.48 million, but the forecast for September expects a slight pullback to 1.45 million.

Housing starts give a glimpse of what‚Äôs already happened, while building permits hint at what‚Äôs to come. Both reports will shed light on whether those recent rate cuts have cracked open any growth in the tight housing market, or if there‚Äôs more action on the way.

# ASML Cut Its Guidance For Next Year On Chip Sector Weakness

It turns out, even chipmakers have their bad days.¬†

ASML, the key supplier of fancy semiconductor equipment, sent shockwaves through the market this week by slashing its 2025 sales expectations earlier this week. The result? A brutal $420 billion wipeout across chip stocks in the U.S. and Asia. Why? ASML reported receiving just half the orders analysts expected, catching everyone off guard.

**The Crown Jewel of Chipmaking**¬†  
ASML is no small fry‚Äîit‚Äôs the only company that produces the coveted ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, the $200 million beasts responsible for making cutting-edge chips that power AI programs and smartphones.¬†

Despite hopes that the AI boom would save the day, it wasn't enough to counteract sluggish demand from the automotive and industrial sectors. Even ASML‚Äôs big-name clients like Intel and Samsung have felt the pinch from disappointing sales.

**China‚Äôs Chip Dilemma**¬†  
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, ASML‚Äôs biggest market‚ÄîChina‚Äîis in for a rough ride. New export restrictions mean ASML can‚Äôt sell its DUV machines, a crucial component for chipmaking, to Chinese companies. That‚Äôs a problem, considering nearly half of ASML‚Äôs Q2 sales came from China, with companies scrambling to snag equipment before the restrictions kicked in.¬†

Now, with the market drying up, ASML has some serious challenges ahead.

**What‚Äôs Next? Cloudy Skies for Chips**¬†  
Even as the dust settles, ASML‚Äôs woes aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. The broader chip industry continues to struggle, and while AI demand remains strong, it‚Äôs not enough to fix the inventory issues plaguing other sectors.¬†

With 2025 expectations lowered and no quick fixes in sight, ASML‚Äîand the entire chip market‚Äîare in for a chippy ride.

The housing market is serving up a double feature this week. First on deck: US housing starts, showing how many single-family homes broke ground last month. August clocked in at 1.36 million starts‚Äîthe highest since April‚Äîwhile experts predict September will land pretty close at 1.35 million.

Then we‚Äôve got building permits, aka the green light for future construction. August saw a 4.9% jump to 1.48 million, but the forecast for September expects a slight pullback to 1.45 million.

Housing starts give a glimpse of what‚Äôs already happened, while building permits hint at what‚Äôs to come. Both reports will shed light on whether those recent rate cuts have cracked open any growth in the tight housing market, or if there‚Äôs more action on the way.

# Netflix‚Äôs Push to Boost Earnings Pays Off

Netflix isn‚Äôt slowing down‚Äîdespite strikes disrupting Hollywood, the streaming giant added over 5 million subscribers in Q3, blowing past Wall Street‚Äôs expectations of 4.5 million.¬†

With revenue up 15% to $9.83 billion and earnings per share hitting $5.40, Netflix is making investors smile. Its stock? Jumped 5% in after-hours trading, reminding everyone it‚Äôs still the streaming king.

**The Password Crackdown Pays Off**¬†  
One big driver of those numbers? Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing. Turns out, people don‚Äôt mind paying for their own accounts after all.¬†

But while the crackdown gave subscriber growth a temporary boost, analysts aren‚Äôt sure how long that momentum will last. Plus, Netflix‚Äôs ventures into advertising and video games haven‚Äôt yet made a major financial splash, leaving some investors skeptical about the stock‚Äôs future growth.

**Ads and Live Events: Netflix‚Äôs New Playbook**¬†  
Speaking of advertising, Netflix‚Äôs ad-supported tier is gaining traction. Subscriptions for the ad-tier jumped 35% quarter-over-quarter, with more than half of new sign-ups opting for it in available markets.¬†

Netflix is doubling down on this by investing in live events‚Äîthink boxing matches and NFL games‚Äîto attract more advertisers. They expect ad revenue to double by 2025, so stay tuned.

**What‚Äôs Next? More Content, Higher Prices**¬†  
Netflix is gearing up for an even bigger slate next year, with¬†*Squid Game*¬†Season 2 and new live sports content leading the charge. But there‚Äôs a catch: higher prices.¬†

The company is raising prices in markets like Italy and Spain and phasing out cheaper plans elsewhere. It‚Äôs all part of a strategy to hit $44 billion in revenue by 2025, even if subscriber growth cools.

One big driver of those numbers? Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing. Turns out, people don‚Äôt mind paying for their own accounts after all.¬†

But while the crackdown gave subscriber growth a temporary boost, analysts aren‚Äôt sure how long that momentum will last. Plus, Netflix‚Äôs ventures into advertising and video games haven‚Äôt yet made a major financial splash, leaving some investors skeptical about the stock‚Äôs future growth.

**Ads and Live Events: Netflix‚Äôs New Playbook**¬†  
Speaking of advertising, Netflix‚Äôs ad-supported tier is gaining traction. Subscriptions for the ad-tier jumped 35% quarter-over-quarter, with more than half of new sign-ups opting for it in available markets.¬†

Netflix is doubling down on this by investing in live events‚Äîthink boxing matches and NFL games‚Äîto attract more advertisers. They expect ad revenue to double by 2025, so stay tuned.

**What‚Äôs Next? More Content, Higher Prices**¬†  
Netflix is gearing up for an even bigger slate next year, with¬†*Squid Game*¬†Season 2 and new live sports content leading the charge. But there‚Äôs a catch: higher prices.¬†

The company is raising prices in markets like Italy and Spain and phasing out cheaper plans elsewhere. It‚Äôs all part of a strategy to hit $44 billion in revenue by 2025, even if subscriber growth cools.

# ASML Cut Its Guidance For Next Year On Chip Sector Weakness

It turns out, even chipmakers have their bad days.¬†

ASML, the key supplier of fancy semiconductor equipment, sent shockwaves through the market this week by slashing its 2025 sales expectations earlier this week. The result? A brutal $420 billion wipeout across chip stocks in the U.S. and Asia. Why? ASML reported receiving just half the orders analysts expected, catching everyone off guard.

**The Crown Jewel of Chipmaking**¬†  
ASML is no small fry‚Äîit‚Äôs the only company that produces the coveted ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, the $200 million beasts responsible for making cutting-edge chips that power AI programs and smartphones.¬†

Despite hopes that the AI boom would save the day, it wasn't enough to counteract sluggish demand from the automotive and industrial sectors. Even ASML‚Äôs big-name clients like Intel and Samsung have felt the pinch from disappointing sales.

**China‚Äôs Chip Dilemma**¬†  
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, ASML‚Äôs biggest market‚ÄîChina‚Äîis in for a rough ride. New export restrictions mean ASML can‚Äôt sell its DUV machines, a crucial component for chipmaking, to Chinese companies. That‚Äôs a problem, considering nearly half of ASML‚Äôs Q2 sales came from China, with companies scrambling to snag equipment before the restrictions kicked in.¬†

Now, with the market drying up, ASML has some serious challenges ahead.

**What‚Äôs Next? Cloudy Skies for Chips**¬†  
Even as the dust settles, ASML‚Äôs woes aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. The broader chip industry continues to struggle, and while AI demand remains strong, it‚Äôs not enough to fix the inventory issues plaguing other sectors.¬†

With 2025 expectations lowered and no quick fixes in sight, ASML‚Äîand the entire chip market‚Äîare in for a chippy ride.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The housing market is serving up a double feature this week. First on deck: US housing starts, showing how many single-family homes broke ground last month. August clocked in at 1.36 million starts‚Äîthe highest since April‚Äîwhile experts predict September will land pretty close at 1.35 million.

Then we‚Äôve got building permits, aka the green light for future construction. August saw a 4.9% jump to 1.48 million, but the forecast for September expects a slight pullback to 1.45 million.

Housing starts give a glimpse of what‚Äôs already happened, while building permits hint at what‚Äôs to come. Both reports will shed light on whether those recent rate cuts have cracked open any growth in the tight housing market, or if there‚Äôs more action on the way.

1g51kxd_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX Earnings Play: Calendar Spread Ideas with a Strong IV Skew ,"Hey everyone,

With Netflix‚Äôs earnings report coming up tomorrow (10/17) after market close, I've been looking into some potential options plays. The current Implied Volatility (IV) for this earnings cycle is at an eye-popping 120%, and the market is pricing in a move of about +/- 50 points. As we know, calendar spreads can offer a great reward-to-risk ratio in these kinds of high-volatility environments. However, there's a catch: if the move is too big and the IV collapses significantly post-earnings, calendar spreads can sink fast.

I‚Äôve been scouting for calendar spreads for this week and next week that have a decent IV skew. Specifically, I‚Äôm seeing at least a 50 percentage-point IV skew between the front-month and back-month options for the nearest expiration. By comparison, the expiration after that shows only a 13-point IV skew, which is much less attractive but more stable.

To optimize the trade, I focused on finding calendars where the delta of the front leg is between 20-50, which gives a good balance of risk/reward for directional and neutral moves. Additionally, I made sure the strike volume is at least 10 contracts to avoid illiquidity in either leg. This can be key in ensuring tight bid-ask spreads and better execution.

If you're considering similar plays, keep an eye on that IV skew and the potential for IV crush post-earnings. Anyone else tracking NFLX for tomorrow? Would love to hear your thoughts or what setups you‚Äôre eyeing!

Good luck trading!",2024-10-16,9,5
1g46r3n_NFLX,NFLX,"The Future of Netflix: No Moat, No Margin - Like an Airline?","NFLX will report its Q3 results on October 17. Revenue and operating income are likely to meet or beat estimates, but future guidance looks risky in my opinion. 

It looks like Netflix has reached its limit in terms of new subscribers and price increases. Daily active users are down in all three months of Q3, and that's the first time that's happened since late 2021, when the stock was also falling (source: BofA research note, 10/7/2024: Internet/e Commerce September app data: Mixed trends with Amazon DAU acceleration a bright spot).

With Netflix trading at 38 times estimated 2025 earnings, there isn't much of a ""margin of safety"". Today, the streaming industry is a bit like the airline industry: the players are fairly interchangeable to the customer, with not much to differentiate them. Aside from the content (which I think is declining in quality), Netflix's ""you can cancel at any time"" service literally has no moat. 

The first streaming company spends 10 billion on content, the next 20 billion, and so on, while there is a clear ceiling on the prices they can charge. And Amazon is giving away its streaming almost as a free bonus to its Prime subscription... In the long run, it's the customers who win, not the investors.",2024-10-15,176,145

1e9tasn_NFLX,NFLX,240% Gain NFLX Calendar Last Week,"I really like and probably will only trade from now on calendars, and Strangles overnight 4/5dte for CPI or other very big news related events. Double calendars allow me to take a neutral position, profiting in either direction as long as stay within breakevens.

Last week, NFLX reported on the 18th. I took a position July 10th, double calendar or call calendar $715 and put calendar $650, when the price was $680. Figured $650 would act like strong support, figured $700 would act like strong resistance but if we overshot some set on $715.

I closed the $715 call calendar the day before earning's since the price was then at $650 and not budging, the entire market was selling off last week. Held the $650 through earning's, expecting flat or bearish movement. Sold 10am when price was at $650 for 240% gain.

I only take position sizes 1%-2% of portfolio so it's not a crazy amount in but huge gain and further proves me to the power of calendars and neutral structures placed at good support/resistance.

Am holding double calendar on TSL $220/$280, implied move is around 10% but this is something will close before earning's most likely. Calendars on Google $170/$185/$200, Vertiv $80/$100, Chipotle $50/$55/$60, many will close before earning's for secure profit and take smaller size of contracts through earning's.

Also did 208% on TSM by selling before earning's, if held through earning's this contract would've ran to $400 or 700% gain. I sold before to secure profit, closing $185 and $200 calendars ($200 was small loss). I didn't want to gamble TSM earning's outcome.

My thinking was this was a low risk way to get a longer duration call for a bit cheaper which gives me a couple weeks to hold if it pulls the normal NFLX of bad earnings but a rise back over the days after the ER.

Earnings per share: $4.88 vs $4.74 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $9.56 billion vs.9.53 billion expected by LSEG

Total memberships: 274.4 million paid memberships expected, according to StreetAccount

Advertising has become an increasingly important business model for media companies to boost ‚Äî or in some cases, achieve ‚Äî profitability for streaming. Netflix‚Äôs stock has been uplifted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.

The company has also begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.

Netflix had roughly 270 million global subscribers at the end of the first quarter, up 16% from the same period in year prior and surpassing expectations.

When Netflix made its pitch to advertisers during its Upfront presentation in May, the company said its ad-supported tier had amassed 40 million global monthly active users, nearly double the figure it had shared months earlier.

Last quarter Netflix warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning next year, noting the company is ‚Äúfocused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.‚Äù

This decision showcases Netflix‚Äôs ‚Äúpivot from a high-growth, low-profit business to a slow-growth, high-profit business,‚Äù according to an analyst note from Wedbush last week. However, the note emphasizes that although Netflix has a big lead ahead of its competitors when it comes to the streaming business, that pivot ‚Äúis far from complete.‚Äù

1e1pxll_NFLX,NFLX,"I am shorting NFLX into earnings next week, and so can you!","

Hello fellow regards, your local area degen here with another great short idea in a raging bull market! Interested? Listen on. Lets talk about Netflix. Netflix touched an ATH of \~695 then double-topped off. This is where I actually opened my position for a 650/610 put spread for 7/19. So, why am I shorting it?

\* It's valued at \~300B and a PE of 45 and forward PE of 37. This is how growing raging tech companies are priced. Maybe Netflix could be considered a tech company 10 years ago, but today streaming tech is a commodity. There is no technology moat here.

\* So what is Netflix then? It's a content company! Which brings me to my next point:

\* Netflix content has been raw dogshit for the last few years. What's the last good original content they released? They've just been trying to push Stranger things for the last 6 years.

\* The only screws they have left to turn are milking the existing user base either with price hikes or pushing ad-supported plans.

\* This strategy has given the stock a boost for the last few quarters, but I think the jig is up. There's a reason why they stopped reporting subscriber numbers... because new users aren't signing up anymore. And given where we are with inflation, I think the consumer's tolerance for price hikes has been reached. Who the fuck wants to pay $25/month for some C-level content and Korean soap operas?

\* Another ominous sign is that today, on one of the greenest days for the whole market, it's about the only red dot on my screen. People know a reckoning is coming.

\* My position is as stated above... it's up about 100% already but I'm definitely holding through earnings... either max pain or max gain baby!

That's all for this episode of how to lose money and make friends!

Edit: About 80% of the responses to this post are telling me that I‚Äôm fully regarded and that Netflix is the greatest thing since sliced bread for 10 different reasons. This is a strong signal for me, combined with a lot of downvotes on the original post. Thank you everyone who contributed for boosting my confidence!

1dkri9l_COP,COP,Netflix Launches Its Own Line of Popcorn for $4.50 a Bag,"Netflix will now sell you a ready-to-eat bag of popcorn to go with your ready-to-binge TV show.

The streamer is teaming with popcorn company Popcorn Indiana for the new line of Netflix‚Äôs Now Popping snacks. The two flavors are ‚ÄúCult Classic Cheddar Kettle‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwoonworthy Cinnamon Kettle.‚Äù The Netflix-branded popcorn will be available at Walmart stores nationwide and at other retailers; Popcorn Indiana has a locator search for where to buy it at this link.

An 8-ounce bag of Netflix Now Popping costs $4.49, according to grocery chain Shoprite. That means if you buy one bag of each flavor, you‚Äôll already have paid more than the monthly cost of the Netflix Basic plan with ads ($6.99/month in the U.S.).

Netflix likely doesn‚Äôt expect to suddenly start making a bucketful of money by selling snacks ‚Äî rather, the more important part of this is getting its brand in front of shoppers at thousands of retail outlets. Note that AMC Theatres also has its own line of popcorn, launched in 2021 as a bid to extend its branding and perhaps make some extra revenue after movie theaters suffered a dramatic drop-off during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Netflix‚Äôs Now Popping isn‚Äôt the first food-related brand extension for the company. In 2020, it inked a deal with Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, which introduced Netflix & Chilll‚Äôd flavor (peanut butter ice cream with sweet-and-salty pretzel swirls and fudge brownies). That‚Äôs still available on store shelves.

A ‚Äúmovie night and popcorn go together like a hot dog and a bun, ice cream and sprinkles, or a beach day and a lounge chair,‚Äù the streamer said in announcing the popcorn line. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Netflix and Popcorn Indiana have teamed up to debut Now Popping, a new ready-to-eat popcorn line available to snack on now.‚Äù

Among other moves it has made to instantiate the Netflix brand IRL, the company ‚Äî famously averse to long theatrical release windows ‚Äî now runs three movie theaters: New York‚Äôs Paris Theater, the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Bay Theater in Pacific Palisades, Calif. And in 2025, it plans to launch entertainment, restaurant and retail complexes (dubbed ‚ÄúNetflix House‚Äù) in Dallas and King of Prussia, Pa., occupying more than than 100,000 square feet each at abandoned department store locations.

Popcorn Indiana was started by ‚Äúa team of folks out of the Northeast‚Äù and named after the small town of Popcorn, Ind., according to its website. In 2017, Cleveland-based Eagle Foods acquired Popcorn Indiana and the product is now produced at a single facility located in Waukegan, Ill.

Netflix announced the new popcorn line as part of touting its summer lineup of TV shows, movies and games. Those include the third and final season of ‚ÄúVikings: Valhalla‚Äù and new seasons of ‚ÄúToo Hot to Handle‚Äù and ‚ÄúBarbecue Showdown‚Äù; rom-com ‚ÄúA Family Affair‚Äù starring Nicole Kidman, Joey King and Zac Efron; and ‚ÄúBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F‚Äù starring Eddie Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

1c860yh_NFLX,NFLX,Netflix Profits Grow As Subscribers Grow,"Everyone thought it was the end for the streaming giant once Netflix began cracking down on password sharing. Users of the platform were so used to leaching off of friends or passing on their information to friends and family, but now the conglomerate was making us pay $6.99 to $22.99 a month to use the platform. Well, it looks like consumers gave in.

**The Result**

Millions of new subscribers as Netflix, still the dominant player in the streaming world, added 9 million subscribers in the past three months, hitting a new record high of 269.9 million subscribers. The company also reported $9.37 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $5.28 for the first quarter.

These are big numbers.

While the current subscriber additions topped Wall Street estimates, the company is still reeling from market reactions to its blowout fourth-quarter report when Netflix only added 13 million subscribers for the entire quarter.¬†

This led the company to [announce ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflix-stock-slips-after-streamer-says-it-wont-share-subscriber-numbers)

its plans to stop sharing quarterly subscriber numbers in 2025. By doing so, the company is covering its bases in case a major decline in subscriber growth were to happen again, as it absolutely decimated its stock the last time it happened.

The company is innovating its revenue model and adding new features, such as advertising. Many of these features have different impacts on KPIs and metrics investors often hold dear when evaluating the company. In order to avoid having major impacts and swings every quarter with the release of growth metrics, the company has decided to keep them on an annual basis. This prevents volatility in its stock price and valuation while also allowing the company to ‚Äúquit while it's ahead‚Äù and keep its position as the subscriber champion among its rivals.¬†

The company is likely predicting that the growth in subscribers will likely eventually recede as they continue to ebb closer and closer to market saturation. The boost from paid subscribers will likely fade in the next couple of quarters as users switch to personal accounts.¬†

**Netflix's Reinvention**

Not long ago, investors remembered the brand struggling to keep up with its rising competitors. Well, this is not the case anymore.¬†

The company‚Äôs first-quarter letter to shareholders displayed several goals that the brand was looking to reach, one of them being to ‚Äúsustain healthy growth long term‚Äù and ‚Äúimprove the variety and quality of entertainment.‚Äù¬†

What did Netflix mean by this?

Simply speaking, the platform wants to introduce more great TV shows and movies, plus a stronger slate of games and must-watch live programming. In recent months, Netflix has expanded into live sports entertainment. In February, the platform aired its first-ever live awards show and followed that up with a 10-year deal to air ‚ÄúWWE Raw‚Äù live. That deal was valued at more than $5 billion.

In terms of gaming, Netflix has gotten more creative. The company partnered with Rockstar Games, the producer of ‚ÄúGrand Theft Auto.‚Äù This wildly popular video game franchise is set to release its 6th game, touted to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time.¬†

However, not all has been peachy for Netflix, as last month‚Äôs Oscars was a big disappointment. Though the streaming service continues to lead its rivals in terms of nominations, the platform only took home one award for best live-action short film. Going forward, it looks as if the company is moving away from the core of its business, spending mountains of money to develop the world‚Äôs best big-budget films and TV shows to win these awards.¬†

While this has worked in the past, a change in strategy is needed. After the explosion in popularity of its show ‚ÄúSuits,‚Äù the company has decided to enact a new plan of licensing its content to other studios. New generations of users are discovering iconic shows from the '90s and early 2000s, such as ‚ÄúSeinfeld‚Äù and ‚ÄúSex and the City‚Äù after the show was featured on the Netflix Platform.¬†

This allows Netflix to license older content that the platform isn‚Äôt planning to continue with to rivals for large payouts, adding another source of revenue for the company.¬†

**New Subscriber Tier**

Netflix‚Äôs new cheaper subscriber tier has found great adoption and success. The ad tier, which costs just $6.99 per month in the United States, is less than Netflix‚Äôs other subscription plans and has seen explosive growth. The major difference between this model and its existing, more expensive tier is the introduction of ads. Advertisements are another way for the company to make money, as the platform is sought after by companies for its immense reach. These ads allow the company to offset its costs and provide the tier at a discounted price to its users.¬†

Currently, the Netflix ad tier has more than 23 million users, growing roughly 65% quarter-over-quarter.

I'm curious, what does ValueInvesting think of Netflix?¬†

 will no longer provide quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user starting next year, the company said Thursday as it reported earnings that beat on the top and bottom line.

Total memberships rose 16% in the quarter, reaching 269.6 million, well above the 264.2 million Wall Street had expected. However, this quarter will be one of the last glimpses investors get of the company‚Äôs subscriber base going forward.

‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve noted in previous letters, we‚Äôre focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics ‚Äî and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction,‚Äù the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. ‚ÄúIn our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential.‚Äù

Netflix said now that it is generating substantial profit and free cash flow ‚Äî as well as developing new revenue streams like advertising and a password sharing crackdown ‚Äî its membership numbers are not the only factor in the company‚Äôs growth. It said the metric lost significance after it started to offer multiple price points for memberships.

The company said it would still announce ‚Äúmajor subscriber milestones as we cross them.‚Äù

Netflix also noted that it expects paid net additions to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter ‚Äúdue to typical seasonality.‚Äù

Shares of the company fell around 3% in extended trading.

Here are the results:

Earnings per share: $5.28 vs. $4.52 expected by LSEG

Revenue: $9.37 billion vs. $9.28 billion expected by LSEG

Total memberships: 269.6 million vs. 264.2 million expected, according to Street Account

Netflix reported first-quarter net income of $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, versus $1.30 billion, or $2.88 per share, in the prior-year period.

The company posted revenue of $9.37 billion for the quarter, up from $8.16 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The streaming company is navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, as it uses price hikes, a crackdown on password sharing and an ad-supported tier to boost revenue. Investors are looking for signs that these efforts are still boosting Netflix and seeking more details about the company‚Äôs foray into video games.

Netflix could also provide more insight into its partnership with TKO Group Holdings
 to bring WWE to the platform. The company has teased that it would like to expand its live sports offerings.

‚ÄúToday, our share of TV viewing is less than 10% in every country,‚Äù Netflix wrote. ‚ÄúSo we have plenty of room to add value for our members and grow our share of viewing by broadening our slate, including with live events (comedy, sports, competition shows, music).‚Äù

As of Thursday morning, the company‚Äôs stock was up 27% year to date and around 85% over the last 12 months.

1aiol8j_NFLX,NFLX,Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis,"***Note: Not Financial Advice***

# Introduction:

NFLX prices dropped to their 5Y lowest in 2022 when they announced their first quarter in years when the number of subscribers had fallen. This was accompanied by other media companies dipping their toes into streaming services for the first time. It seemed that investors believed the golden era of NFLX dominance was over. However, NFLX made certain changes such as paid-sharing and ad-tier making radical changes to adapt to the situation on the ground quickly. The recent release of earnings results displays that NFLX's efforts are paying off and NFLX has solidified its position in being the leader to capture the streaming market.

# Revenue:

Beyond paid sharing and ad-tier subscription, how NFLX sees its revenue and subscribers growing is through improving the value of their offering. They want to offer diversity (Live Entertainment like WWE). NFLX has also begun receiving some of their competitors' content as NFLX is the only one with sufficient reach to deliver the full value of the IP e.g. HBO‚Äôs Suits. NFLX broadcasted it and revived Suits. Streaming services like HBO Max ([SOURCE](https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/removed-hbo-max-movies-shows-warner-bros-discovery-merger-list/)) and Disney, are removing shows (Band of Brothers, How I met your Mother) and licensing them to NFLX to avoid paying residuals. NFLX can scoop these shows up as they have sufficient reach to truly utilize the value of the IPs that were removed.

I assumed that the revenue per subscriber from both ad-tier and non ad-tier is the same, the difference in sales price is made up by the revenue from advertisers. So both ad-tier and non ad-tier subscribers are lumped together in my forecast.

The churn rate was taken from ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-wins-streaming-wars-this-chart-shows-why-2024-1#:~:text=This%20data%20comes%20to%20us,customers%20are%20with%20the%20product)). I assumed that it took another 4 years for the churn rate to tick back down, the churn rate is slightly higher for consumers that are either still trying out ad-tier or are affected by paid-sharing. To avoid being overly granular when making assumptions about consumer's consumption habits, I assumed that the perpetual churn rate remained constant at historic amounts.

When forecasting the number of subscribers, opting for less granularity I forecasted subscribers as a whole without distinction for whether they are old or new subscribers and the churn rate applies to all subscribers as a whole.

The growth in subscribers is fueled by better content offerings, the streaming services market getting more efficient, and marketing. As NFLX continues offering more exclusive high-quality content, this incentivizes people to subscribe to NFLX. This is further fueled by certain competitor selling their IPs to NFLX due to the cost of these shows (Residuals) being higher than the benefit of these shows. As NFLX continues improving its strong branding, it will eventually build a strong enough reputation as a contender for being on consumer‚Äôs TV when streaming services completely overtake Linear Networks.

‚Äúour engagement is a bit impacted by our paid sharing. Think about it like fewer households using the same account. So, as those folks spin off and get their own accounts and we win them over with our programming, that will normalize and continue to grow.‚Äù - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.

I assumed that in the first 3 years of my forecast, the rate of subscriber increase tended higher before tapering back down and then a slight increase in rate due to the streaming and liner network market getting more efficient.

When forecasting Annual Revenue/Subscriber, as NFLX's main underserved markets lie in Asia and other less wealthy countries and management sees paid-sharing as a sort of quasi-price increase, I‚Äôd assumed that prices increase at a slow rate before increasing at the perpetual inflation rate.

# 

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, COGS mainly consists of the amortization of acquired content. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages as I assumed that management continues their current pace of spending.

When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing would remain constant for the first half of my forecast before tapering downwards slightly as NFLX gains a strong brand so there is less need for advertising.

When forecasting R&D and G&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.03%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) = 1.28

Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.92%

NFLX is rated ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2433501/))

BBB Bond yield = 5.41%

Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%

AT-COD = 4.27%

Stock Price (5D Avg) = $566.24

Shares O/S = 432.76M

Market Value of Equity = 245046.02M

Weighted Average Maturity of debt = 4 Years.

FY23 Interest Expense = 699.83M

Market Value of Debt = 14882.36M

%Debt = 5.73%

%Equity = 94.27%

%WACC = 9.60%

# CapEX, D&A and Content Acquisiton:

When forecasting CapEX and D&A, opting for less granularity I assumed it as a % of historic averages.  


When forecasting Content Acquisition, as management has stated that they intent on spending 17B on content acquisition for FY24, so I forecasted FY24 as such. For the high growth period, I assume that NFLX has to keep up content acquisition in line with historic in order to keep remaining attractive to new subscribers. Beyond the high growth period, I assumed that NFLX will get more capital efficient and reinvest negative amounts given that the streaming market is now significantly more efficient and there is less need to constantly feed money into content acquisition endlessly. 

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in base case I value NFLX at $371.71 per share. NFLX's nearest competitor Disney is having troubles focusing solely on streaming due to the major restructuring of their core business operations that has to be done, which may cannibalise or hinder their progress. I believe that NFLX's intrinsic value could be significantly be higher due to their dominant position in the streaming market. However, in order to forecast NFLX nearer to its current market price at about $560 would require making very bold assumptions such as the fall of a few streaming services that leads to mass migration of subscribers into NFLX or the accelerated decline of Linear Network.

19e8b9s_SBUX,SBUX,NFLX beat has made me bearish on theatre stocks and SBUX looks like it wants to die.,"In 2023 for the short amount of time I was bearish (flipped after I saw reverse repo), I was ALWAYS scared to buy NFLX puts. Majority people I know are just staying in because outside is too expensive. The problem is, it is getting worse. Last week I saw a gas station charge $6 for 2 gatorades and lost it.

Anyway, its has performed well as I predicted because even with the price increase, it is a huge amount of savings compared to 1 theatre trip. Movies used to be a good place for the US romance sector before it took a dump like AMC stock. 

As long as things are too expensive, I expect NFLX to grow. I think all high ticket items are going to get a beating. SBUX has the nastiest H&S I have ever seen in my life because they continue to think charging crazy money for a sugar crash coffee in these times is a good idea. Pepsico Rockstars are way better value for the working folk, and they have crazy good zero calorie flavors, in my opinion, compared to Monster. The caffiene content doesnt even come close, with a grande at SBUX being like 95mg for $5, and rockstar being 200mg for half the price. 

I expect stupid expensive crap to fail. Apple headsets I think are going to be a disaster (maybe they already are). Anyways, I think AMC/SBUX puts for me.

- Netflix added 13.1 million subscribers during the fourth quarter.

- The company now has 260.8 million paid subscribers.

- The company also topped Wall Street‚Äôs revenue expectations.

Here are the results:

- Earnings: $2.11 per share vs. $2.22 per share expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

- Revenue: $8.83 billion vs. $8.71 billion expected by LSEG.

- Total memberships expected: 260.8 million vs. 256 million expected, according to Street Account

- The company now has 260.8 million paid subscribers, a new record for the streamer.

In October, the company said it added 8.76 million paid memberships in the third quarter, pushing its total to 247 million. Wall Street expects Netflix to have continued that trend in the fourth quarter, with forecasts projecting another 8 million to 9 million paid membership adds, bringing the company to roughly 256 million. Netflix took another step toward building subscribers when it announced earlier Tuesday that it would stream the popular WWE Raw starting next year. The deal is the streaming platform‚Äôs biggest step yet into live entertainment.

Netflix is still navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue. Investors got a sneak preview of growth in Netflix‚Äôs advertising-based plan earlier this month, when the company‚Äôs president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, told attendees at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES that the company now has more than 23 million global monthly active users. That‚Äôs up from 15 million that the company reported in November.

This gives them about $8B in FCF annually  which is about $2B short of what they owe in debt less cash last quarter of $10B.

So they need about 61M net new subs to close that gap. 

Now they claim 100M people were non paid subs they kicked off during the password crackdown and they would get most of those back. Only 9M came back last quarter which is problem number 1.

Problem number 2 is they need to continue to raise prices without losing subs.

Problem number 3 is the churn of the content itself every year at an enormous cost and hitting 60 home run titles a year.

Even with unlimited resources that model is going to crack soon at this ridiculous valuation. 

Netflix usually does the opposite of what I think so they will probably hit record growth next report and announce a partnership with GTA 6 and Taylor Swift.",2023-12-19,7983,1151

It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not ""broken"" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).

The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.

The big story on the stock front this week is earnings, with the regional banks starting to report (as well as the rest of the big Wall Street banks, and then tech reports start to heat up, led by Netflix and Tesla this week.

I've been a fairly active market participant for close to a decade now but never really with options. Now I'm looking at a few possible methodologies to short through EOY and, while I've taken quick trades in $SQQQ and $NVDS etc in the past, I don't like the idea of the potential for decay over 2 to 3 months. Granted, I'm also aware that Theta Decay is a factor when buying options (although I'll admit I'm not well versed in how to calculate this).

So, for sake of example, let's say I want to short NFLX in the next few weeks. I see March 15th 2024 options at $315 strike trading at ~$14 ($1400 per contract). Is this too far out? What happens if say, Netflix goes to $290 by December 2023 and I hold one of the aforementioned contracts? I assume it's then 'in the money' and generating some % return? Would I want to continue holding if the share price kept going down?

My ultimate goal is to (with NFLX or other) enter a short position where I have 3 to 4 months leeway to be 'right' with my price target.

If anyone has any recommended reading or videos on shorting with puts, duration and assessing things like OI and spread, that would be greatly appreciated!",2023-09-25,0,20

I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles *(Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT & Margin of Safety).* This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the Company
2. Qualitative Analysis
3. Quantitative Analysis
4. Buy Price

**History of Netflix**

Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix's largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.

This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer *is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost.* Let me explain.

* *Better deals:* Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it's time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.
* *Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (*Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices).* Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on *store clerks who knew nothing about their customers' movie tastes*.
* *Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:* In 2004, Netflix's logistics systems included *only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States.* A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix *served the same market with only one warehouse.* Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.
* *Online streaming:* Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. *Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.*

**Overview:**

Netflix is one of the world‚Äôs leading entertainment services with approximately *238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries* enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of ‚Äúwinning moments of truth‚Äù. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.

**Qualitative Analysis:**

Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure. 

There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:

* *Linear:* Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.
* Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix: *There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.*

1. Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, *Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix's only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.*
2. Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.
3. Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that *theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.*
4. Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the ""pay one"" window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.

This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider. 

* Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m. 
* At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: *20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren't anywhere like it is today due to inflation.* ***People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.***
* Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins. 

How did I calculate Free Cash Flow? 

Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:

* Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property & Equipment = Free Cash Flow. 

I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. ***Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!*** 

**BUY PRICE:**

If you made it this far in the post then congratulations üòÇ üëèüéâ . My buy price ranges from ***$182 to around $250.*** I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate.

I'm spewing I missed out this opportunity to buy last year but I have only looked into Netflix this year. If you gained some knowledge from this analysis and want to show any support I welcome you to subscribe to my Youtube channel. You can find this on my profile.

My chase caused over-risk so I immediately trimmed size to risk of 0.92 R and added back to a risk of 1.01 R near 437.  I then quickly stop out at 438.68. I really should not have touched this market with all the messy action.

One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.

1543ll6_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX Mock Chart Analysis,"Hey guys, just got into learning about day trading. Watched some videos about trends lines, candles, and supports & resistances etc...  
Looking to get some feed back on a quick little example activity I did with NFLX.

I realized there was a consistent support/ resistance line and I fake-bought and fake-sold at the sections depicted in the photo.

How would you analyze this chart? What did I do wrong/right?

Carvana is up an unreal 35%+ this morning after surprising the market with an early earnings report and a debt restructuring plan. This obviously caught the option market completely off guard. Options were only pricing about a 10% move for the rest of this week. But this move is even way beyond what options were pricing for Carvana's assumed reporting date, where they had the expected move at about 27%. Either way, it's difficult for options traders to properly price something moving like CVNA has been lately. It's been having regular 10% type gaps/moves and on past earnings, it's regularly moved 30%+. Options can only pump up so much to account for moves like that as traders and market makers are very wary of properly pricing them (compared to how the stock is moving) and then getting stuck with all that premium when the music stops. Here's how options were priced before the surprise:

Taking a look here at the TSLA earnings we have a beat on EPS, beat on revenue but a miss on free cash flow‚Ä¶ they are saying we are on track for cybertruck production this year too‚Ä¶ as of now and writing this TSLA has been up and down‚Ä¶ overall it will all come down to what Musk says on the call at 530.

We officially‚Ä¶ finally got a new supply on SPY‚Ä¶ 454.21 is our new supply‚Ä¶ one would assume this means we are bearish correct? Well the interesting thing here is that our daily DMI despite the wave down actually bounced and is now waving back up‚Ä¶ 

Not only that we have an imbalance officially on SPY‚Ä¶ what does that mean? It means that we put in a new supply and a supply is supposed to be resistance‚Ä¶ However, as you can see we closed over that supply‚Ä¶ there are two ways to fix this‚Ä¶ the first way is to immediately turn around a put a new demand in which would be at 454.93‚Ä¶ or we turn around and immediately close below the supply‚Ä¶.

If we immediately turn around and put a new demand in then we have our next upside target as 456.82 and 461.48.

However, if we break through and close below 454.21 supply our next support is at 447.02. 

Now from a channel stand point we have been in this yellow channel since July 6th. We remain in that channel with resistance at 460.91 for tomorrow and support is at 454.21. As you can see this 454.21 is critical support for the bulls. 

We perfectly touched and rejected the red bull channel from march today. That resistance sits at 457 for tomorrow which is just over our 456.82 supply.

The way I see SPY if we break through and close over 457 tomorrow we likely are going to 460+. If we close under and break through 454.21 support we likely will be sub 450 by EOW. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.14 -> 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 438.17 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY**

Now this is where things get interesting‚Ä¶ on futures we actually are not seeing a new supply as of writing this. We also have the same fake dmi wave down waving up‚Ä¶ 

Now the big difference here on futes vs SPY is that we did break through the red bull channel resistance. That means we are now in the green shorter term bull channel and the extreme yellow bull channel. 

The yellow bull channel support sits at 4593 and resistance sits at 4660 which is just below our upside demand at 4653. The green bull channel resistance sits at 4625 which is just over the next supply at 4621. 

As of right now for futures if we continue upwards 4625 and 4660 are our next major resistance and targets‚Ä¶ however, if we lose 4593 then we likely test 4577 and see a bigger sell off into EOW. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4492 -> 4577 -> 4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4437 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY**

This is where things on QQQ differ a lot from SPY and if you have watched the last two days of trading you can see the weakness of QQQ vs SPYs strength. 

Now on QQQ we also put a new supply in at 385.73. However, we closed below that level so we actually are balanced. Now this is what I call an opportunities for the bulls‚Ä¶ IF the bulls can fight back tomorrow with a green day then we actually could immediately put a new demand in‚Ä¶ turning a supply into demand would be extremely bullish‚Ä¶ 

However, if we don‚Äôt open green tomorrow on QQQ then we will break this white bull channel support and that likely leads to downside. IF qqq continues to fall tomorrow then out target is 380.1. However, if we can turn this supply into demand then 388.47 and 389.92 are our next major targets. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 380.1 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 365.98 -> 400.01

Working in the favor of the bears is that the VIX did put in a new daily demand at 13.29. With putting this new daily demand in we take out previous demand at 13.5‚Ä¶ this now opens us up for an opportunity to push to the daily 20ema at 14.04.

Today was a brutal day for me‚Ä¶ decided to swing an ES put and it would appear based on the technicals I was one day early‚Ä¶ I attempted to play some calls on what looked convincingly like the breakout when the Apple data hit the market‚Ä¶ but I got hit. Without the swing it wouldn‚Äôt be that big of a red day‚Ä¶ but still unfortunate day‚Ä¶ most of the mid day and into power hour there was absolutely no trend to play. 

I still struggle even with 1dte with being able to get much more than 5% on a play before the ‚Äútop‚Äù is in. Tomorrow I do plan to move to 0dte on QQQ and see how those move‚Ä¶ ",2023-07-19,4,1

1539ywe_NFLX,NFLX,"TSLA/ NFLX Earnings are officially on deck‚Ä¶ 7-18-23 SPY/ ES FUTURES, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","Well if you missed it today QQQ looked (and tech as a whole) extremely weak at open this morning‚Ä¶ we actually saw some of the biggest divergence I have seen on spy and qqq intraday in a long time‚Ä¶ however, MSFT had their conference and boy did the market like that! MSFT officially saved the market today‚Ä¶ 

**TSLA**

&#x200B;

Tesla has a 6.4% move priced in for tomorrow‚Ä¶ personally I think this is low‚Ä¶ I am rather bullish on TSLA for earnings and long term‚Ä¶ I am in $20k of shares of tesla for earnings‚Ä¶ looking for $360. 

**NFLX**

&#x200B;

Netflix earnings is tomorrow after hours‚Ä¶ as of right now we have about a 7.4% out move expected‚Ä¶ Netflix has a pretty strong move today. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7uv6jiddscb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e75af43c26c93a8fe9edd83d5718e082a434a67f

I am going to be organizing my daily Tas a little different now‚Ä¶ instead of a separate price action and S/D section I am going to include it all here together‚Ä¶ try to streamline and show the fuller picture better.

Here on SPY you can see that we are in this absolutely extreme yellow bull channel‚Ä¶ we have been in this channel since July 6th. We also remain in the red bull channel that we have been in since March 8th. 

The red channel resistance sits at 456.52 tomorrow which is just under the 456.82 supply we have‚Ä¶ This likely if we continue this push up will be a major resistance to watch. However, if we break this resistance then we have the yellow channel which gives upside as high as 458.4 area. 

From a supply and demand stand point we have still not put a new supply in‚Ä¶ we did however take out that 452.96 demand today with this push up‚Ä¶ that was my major target for this week and we hit it‚Ä¶ 

The most interesting thing is that SPY daily dmi has started a wave down yet we are pushing higher‚Ä¶ I likely suspect that after this pretty extreme run up and also the distance we are form the daily 8ema that we are going to see todays top turn into a new supply at 454.2 and that likely sets us up to backtest 450 support. 

I had originally been looking for 447 on a sell off but with the overall strength we had here and now that the daily 8ema is above that level I will look for 450 to be support. 

The yellow channels support sits at 452 for tomorrow. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.14 -> 447.02 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 438.17 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gsenur1edscb1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aafbeb9dd11b6bb2fe89bb1f4d0640a0e6d5c8e

Here on futures daily we can see much of the same movement here‚Ä¶ we are still in this pretty extreme yellow bull channel since July 10th. Now today we did come just under that red bull channel resistance. 

This is setting up pretty nicely to form a double top off 4584 which would put in a new supply and effectively take out 4577 supply. I previously mentioned 4492 supply was a possible area to watch for on a retrace but I do not expect that to happen now‚Ä¶ the daily 8ema support sits right around 4523 and that is where I would expect us to bounce if we drop tomorrow. 

The yellow bull channel support sits at 4570 for tomorrow. 

Overall with a daily DMI wave down I do expect to see a retrace tomorrow‚Ä¶ but as usually that likely becomes a dip buying opportunity. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4492 -> 4577 -> 4621  
 Demand- 4437 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vrwe1yjedscb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ce93f8614d11a3969bb2085d3d7cc16d452965e

Of spy and QQQ‚Ä¶ qqq definitely was the most benefitted of the MSFT news‚Ä¶ QQQ looked and was extremely weak this morning and could not find its feet at all‚Ä¶ that MSFT news saved tech from a pretty bloody day in my opinion. 

Now here we are in the same extreme bull channel on QQQ (white here)‚Ä¶ that resistance sits at 392.7 for tomorrow. 

We do have a green bull channel to watch here on QQQ also which we did fall just short of today. That resistance sits at 389.21. we also have our next supply levels (And resistance) at 388.47 to 389.92. I do fully still expect a retrace tomorrow but if we continue to push to the upside then 388.47/ 389.92 supplies are our target. 

If we put in a new supply off today at 385.74 then likely we could come down and take out 380‚Ä¶ we actually did end up testing that and was holding that 380 area this morning during all the weakness. 

The white bull channel support sits at 384 for tomorrow. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 380.1 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 365.98 -> 400.01

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kijxb55fdscb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50160fb05d486522253d3f4c148e268c46eb724

The VIX once again found itself magnetted to this 13.5 area all day. We once again were up until the very last second set up to put in a new daily demand on the VIX‚Ä¶ now the most interesting thing to me today is the fact that when SPY/ QQQ were pushing hard up during the MSFT news we also saw the VIX push up too‚Ä¶ now the fact that we have now spent 4 days with the VIX trading in this same 13.3 to 13.79 area is quite interesting. 

The VIX did also break through is bear channel resistance today. This could be the start of our temporary top and pullback for the market. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8vcj7jfdscb1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7dc6fc85868c46185e852951a3ca88ede2d4e26

Today was a bit of an up and down day‚Ä¶ started the morning off great. And then had some struggles. I once again can not seem to read spy as two of my three losses today were on SPY. I do continue to have nice success with QQQ though. I ended up sticking with 1dte today and had a much higher success rate in doing so. 

I still severely struggled with getting anything over 5% for my wins‚Ä¶ was able to notch out a small green day. My plan here remains trading QQQ 1dte tomorrow (I likely wont touch spy) and if that continues to go well and I do not see many immediate red entries I likely will experiment with 0dte QQQ on Thursday and Friday. 

Overall while SPY plays just have not worked out for me (the overall price action seems far more erratic and range bound than QQQ) the overall use of SPY and QQQ to have the same trend for an entry on QQQ remains a powerful strategy. ",2023-07-18,0,0
152ygyr_MS,MS,"Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.","The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off. On the economic data front advance retail sales missed estimates this morning.

&#x200B;

**Chart of the Day:** Netflix options are pricing about a 7.6% move, a move larger than 4 out of its last 8 earnings moves (2 moves were 20%+). A $5 wide Iron condor expiring Friday, set at the expected move would need the stock to stay between about $413 and $487 to see profits. That $413 level is pretty much the low end of the range NFLX has traded in the past month.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY options are pricing only a 1% move for the week, a very low vol backdrop to the start of earnings season.

14s8h0q_SQ,SQ,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

14s8h0q_LCID,LCID,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times.

14jevod_NFLX,NFLX,Netflix is up 137% in the last year. Is this a breakout or a fakeout?,"# Shares of the streaming stock are on fire. Will the boom last?

The stock market has been full of surprises this year, including the emergence of artificial intelligence as a key narrative, the resilience of the U.S. economy, and the boom in big tech stocks.  
  
Among the most unexpected winners, this year is Netflix (NFLX 0.36%), the leading streamer, whose shares dove most of last year as growth slowed and it faced a new wave of competition from legacy media companies.  
  
After losing more than two-thirds of its value over a six-month span in 2021 and 2022, Netflix has managed to flip the narrative -- the streaming stock is now up 44% year to date and 137% over the past year. Those gains have come for two primary reasons: the introduction of password-sharing fees and the launch of its ad-supported subscription tier.   
  
Both of those moves reflect changes the company has made to its longtime strategy. Let's take a look at the implications of each one to see if the stock can sustain its recent gains.  

# Paid sharing

Paid sharing is likely the most controversial move Netflix has made in a long time. The streaming service had long turned a blind eye toward password sharing as the company believed that it was a way of promoting its service. Management also seemed to think that password borrowers would subscribe directly to the service when they were ready.

However, Netflix's maturing user base seemed to convince the company to crack down on password sharing. Instead of essentially allowing unlimited sharing, Netflix has sent notices to its members telling them that their account is only for them and the people in their homes. They can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their account with someone who does not live with them.  
  
Netflix implemented paid sharing in May, and the stock has jumped since the rollout, up nearly 20% since May 23, when it announced the new policy in the U.S. According to media reports, the move drove a spike in new subscriptions, and over the four-day period from May 25 to May 28, its new customer additions were higher than in any period since at least 2019.  
  
Analysts have roundly cheered the move as well, seeing it as essentially 100% incremental profit as there are basically no costs associated with it. Netflix has yet to report earnings since it rolled out paid sharing, but we should get a sense of the impact when Netflix announces second-quarter results next month.

# The new ad tier

While the password-sharing crackdown should give its bottom line a boost, the ad tier rollout is likely to give a longer-term lift to the business as it allows the company to tap into a new revenue stream and supplement payments from subscribers. 

Reed Hastings, who recently stepped down as co-CEO of Netflix, recognized this opportunity after long resisting advertising, as he noticed that advertiser demand was following TV audiences from linear TV to streaming outlets.  
  
The vast majority of subscribers are expected to remain in the ad-free tier, but Netflix is using the ad-based tier to attract new subscribers. And it appears to be working. As of May, the company had added nearly 5 million subscribers to the ad-supported tier, just six months after the launch, and more than 25% of new subscribers are choosing the ad tier in markets where it's available.

# Is the comeback for real?

Netflix's stock is still down significantly from its peak in late 2021, which came after the subscription boom early in the pandemic, so the recent resurgence should be viewed in that context.  
  
The streamer now faces significantly more competition than it did just a few years ago, but many of its legacy competitors are focused on cutting costs in order to drive profits at their streaming businesses, which gives Netflix an advantage as it not only has a large audience to monetize its content spending, but it also has proven its profitability.

After the rally, Netflix stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 40 based on this year's estimates, which seems fair given its ability to gain operating leverage as it grows revenue. 

While I wouldn't expect another doubling of the stock, it should be able to hold its gains this time around.

# Meta Platforms ($META)

Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.

Investors have also cheered the company‚Äôs aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta‚Äôs prospects.

Meta‚Äôs user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps ‚ÄìFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.

**Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company‚Äôs AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta‚Äôs positioning within the digital ads space.

## Amazon ($AMZN)

Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company‚Äôs retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS‚Äôs growth.

Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN‚Äôs rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon‚Äôs ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.

**Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**

Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company‚Äôs AI market position ‚Äúdiminish.‚Äù

Recent channel checks by Lee‚Äôs firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS‚Äôs generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.

‚ÄúCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,‚Äù said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.

## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.

Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix‚Äôs business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.

**What is the Price Target for Netflix?**

On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.

Prior to the announcement, the analyst‚Äôs firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.

While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.

# Conclusion

Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon‚Äôs AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.",2023-05-29,1,9

138q0z6_NFLX,NFLX,Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis.,"# INTRODUCTION:

NFLX has come a long way since being rejected by blockbuster, its secret formula being the first to embrace change. It embraced DVD at a time where VHS was still the dominant mode of display. It embraced Streaming when the world started catching onto DVD. NFLX's edge was that it always pivoted quickly to the next big thing. But NFLX‚Äôs massive progress may soon grind to a halt. From lackluster solutions to strong competitors and pure market saturation, NFLX has a tough road ahead.   
 

**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**

*Overblown Growth Solutions*

When NFLX lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, people freaked out and started selling off NFLX. But it seems that when NFLX announced its plans and after 1 successful quarter with some results from Ad-Tier NFLX bounced back up almost doubling from when it first dropped due to the shock.   
 

Ad-Tier has some parallels to pirated sites. Both stream contents with Ads injected into the mix, either before the video plays or on the side of the screen. The main difference is that one is free and the other costs $6.99/month.

There are only so many people in the world that wants a YouTube equivalent as their streaming platform. The people who purchase Ad-Tier are usually ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù fans, those that purchase cheaply so that they can watch their favorite series and unsubscribe afterwards. These subscribers have no longevity to them and temporarily bump up NFLX‚Äôs numbers.  
 

Paid-sharing, getting people to get off shared accounts and getting their own accounts. Depending on how NFLX goes about it paid sharing could be a game changer for NFLX. There is already an existing customer base from those that are sharing account, they show a liking for NFLX but whether these customers will convert is dependent on certain factors Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing, ‚ÄòFOMO‚Äô factor and Piracy.

Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing,   
Is the net cast wide enough to catch all the paid-sharing users? What are the ways we go about catching Paid-Sharing?

‚ÄòFOMO‚Äô factor,   
Just how much are customers missing out will determine how they weigh the cost of monthly subscription and the ability to participate in the latest series.

Piracy,   
Is it easy to find alternatives that can provide what NFLX provides for free?

**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**

*Strong Competitors & Lack of C.A.*

The usual suspects obviously include DIS, Hulu and AMZN prime. But, what about the less obvious ones?

TikTok & Instagram reels. There‚Äôs only so much entertainment needed in one‚Äôs life. You can‚Äôt possibly simultaneously watch TikTok while watching a NFLX series, your attention can only be paid in one direction. ([SOURCE](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-netflix-gen-z-video-broadcast-app/634594/#:~:text=TikTok%20has%20jumped%20over%20Netflix,the%20sixth%20most%20popular%20service))

Or AMZN with an all-inclusive ride on their AMZN prime with AMZN prime offering other benefits on their online retail store. They are ‚ÄúOffer-Stacking‚Äù creating an unbeatable offer that NFLX can‚Äôt counter. 

DIS has a large vault of already created storyline that they have archived yet to be released onto Disney+ and the familiarity of DIS‚Äô brand name enhanced by their theme park creates a very strong branding fit for the entire family that NFLX can‚Äôt parallel. ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/294111/leading-organizations-in-licensed-merchandise-worldwide/))

NFLX has no differentiator other than it was the earliest entrant and is now the largest entrant. There are certain exclusive content on NFLX that may make it appealing, but these kinds of advantages are superficial and over the long run, these exclusive content may offer their rights to stream to competitors or may be pirated.  
   
 

**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**

*Market Saturation*

NFLX can only grow so much.

UCAN from FY21-22 only added 0.7M subscribers and LATAM added 3M. LATAM‚Äôs market was already said to be 75% penetrated by NFLX ([SOURCE](https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/netflix-streaming-leader-latin-america-future/)).

NFLX should focus on making its subscribers more valuable which management has said it will focus on now, but it has only so far laid out plans to attract new subscribers. 

Even if Linear Network loses most of its grounds in the next 10 years, NFLX may not gain much subscribers from Linear Network simply because Linear Network is mainly supported by the exact demographic that would not be on NFLX.  


# REVENUE:

***Model***

I‚Äôve used a bottoms-up approach when modelling my revenue and forecasted using historical data and surveys done.

***Revenue/Subscriber***

NFLX applies third degree price discrimination in how it prices subscriptions/month for different regions. Regions where it has already established a presence and where NFLX integrated into their daily life, NFLX charges a higher subscription/month.  
 

But I don‚Äôt think every region will eventually tend towards the UCAN cost. Certain regions may see subscription services as a luxury good.  
 

Overall, with the implementation and wide rollout of the Ad Tier I project my average revenue/customer to be higher for every region as the Ad Tier generates higher revenue per subscriber monthly, according to management.

According to 2021 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, an American with Annual income of $78,743 and expenditure of $66,928 spent 0.97% of that amount in entertainment and of that 0.97% only 18% goes towards ‚ÄúFees and admissions‚Äù so about 0.17% of $66,928 went towards NFLX. $654 represented the annual spending on subscription services + others. NFLX takes up 30% of this, most households have more than 1 subscription. So, NFLX is probably tethering at the limit at which it can raise prices.  
 

Comparing the cost per month of subscription between NFLX and its closest competitor DIS, Disney+ cost $4.80 compared to NFLX $15.86.  
    
So, I forecast that the majority of increase in Revenue/Subscriber for the US will come from wider adoption of Ad-Tier subscription which yields a higher amount of Revenue/Subscriber rather than NFLX increasing prices.

European subscription is one of the highest cost to subscribe ([SOURCE](https://beebom.com/how-much-netflix-costs-each-country-worldwide/)) so, I'd say its unlikely EMEA will raise monthly subscription cost but rather EMEA is the region with the highest likelihood to group subscribe to lower subscription cost. So EMEA is more likely to add subscribers than revenue/subscriber. 

**OVERALL, I assume that the full effects of FOMO for Ad-Tier will only show up from 2025 onwards.**  
 

***No. of Subscriber***

For Paid Sharing,   
NFLX has stated that the potential market could be up to 100+M households. I do also believe that convincing people who were previously sharing accounts of purchasing their own account may take some time to catch on, as they will have large FOMO after being locked out of their old account and missing the latest shows. And since NFLX only intends on fully releasing Paid Sharing from 23Q2 onwards, I believe the substantial addition to subscribers will only show up from 2025 onwards with the FOMO effect in full and Paid Sharing being rolled out entirely.  
 

For fall of Linear Network, 

([SOURCE](https://morningconsult.com/2023/03/28/linear-tv-viewership-gen-z-millennials/))

Almost 40% of Linear Network supporters are baby boomers. As the baby boomers age and decrease in numbers Linear Network will start losing its main customers, freeing up market share for NFLX to take as the younger generations start being associated with Streaming services, streaming will become the new norm.  
 

BUT, this cultural change will be one that takes time. It will not show up to a substantial amount in the time period of my forecast. So I opt for more granularity.    
   
**REVENUE MODEL: \[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9c2expe)\]

# MARGINS:

The difficulty in figuring out margins is that there is no reliable historic data within the past 5 years. Margins were always extremely skewed by extreme conditions.

E.g. from 2019 to 2020 margins jumped from 12% to 18% due to covid accelerating the adoption of NFLX.  
OR in 2021 the marginal cost of acquiring content wrt to revenue being generated was the cheapest of the past 7 years at $0.5836 per $1 of revenue generated. Likely because people were embracing NFLX as tech adoption was accelerated prior year, margins peaking only a year later.

So, cost is broken down into 3 categories (Acquisition, Marketing and (Tech & Dev + G&A)). Tech & Dev + G&A are lumped together for more granularity instead of inaccurate forecasts.  
 

***Acquisition***

As NFLX transitions into subscriber retention mode rather than attracting subscribers it inevitably will spend more on making its services more attractive so that existing customers will face a higher ‚Äúemotional‚Äù switching cost, so churn rate is lowered. But acquisition will continue to take the largest portion of cost.  


***Marketing***

Eventually the NFLX brand becomes more well-known or integrated into people‚Äôs daily life that they spend less on marketing themselves and more on advertising new content. Marketing costs will start to tend downwards. BUT there must always be a baseline amount of marketing cost to advertise new content.  
 

***Tech & Dev + G&A***

Tech & Dev + G&A is likely to remain elevated for the first few years as NFLX starts to roll out Ad-Tier and begin supporting a substantial amount of new subscribers from Ad-Tier. But eventually as the number of new subscribers dwindles down, NFLX gets more efficient and needs fewer employees. It will also implement new tech features e.g. AI tech support to lower the number of employees necessary. So at that point Tech & Dev + G&A will tend downwards.

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I‚Äôve valued NFLX at $174.62, I just don‚Äôt believe in how astronomical growth could be, with all the changes that NFLX has introduced into the company. I believe that NFLX has set their priorities wrongly and are focusing on the wrong things, Subscriber growth shouldn‚Äôt be the focus it should be making our subscribers more profitable. It‚Äôs a good sign that they started caring and innovating again. But at the current trajectory I just don‚Äôt see it working out.

 Netflix reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

* **Earnings per share:** $2.88 vs $2.86 expected
* **Revenue:** $8.16 billion vs $8.18 billion expected

On Tuesday, Netflix said goodbye to what got it started ‚Äî it‚Äôs DVD mailing business, in which it would send out the discs in red envelopes to customers. The company‚Äôs Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a blog post that it would finally wind down the DVD business, which ‚Äúcontinues to shrink.‚Äù

A year ago, Netflix had reported its first subscriber loss in a decade, sending its shares on a downward spiral, as well as those of its media peers. The results pushed Netflix and its streaming rivals to focus on profits over subscriber numbers.

Results for the country‚Äôs new ad-supported tier will be top of mind. Last November, Netflix unveiled its cheaper tier with commercials, which costs $6.99 a month. The ad-supported tier came shortly after it lost subscribers as streaming competition ramped up.

Sarandos recently said the company is likely to offer multiple ad-supported tiers in the future.

Another focus for Wall Street will be Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing. Late last year, the company said it would begin rolling out measures to have people who have been borrowing other accounts create their own.

The company has said more than 100 million households share accounts, or about 43% of its global user base. That has affected its ability to invest in new content, Netflix has said. Both the ad-supported option and crackdown on password sharing are meant to boost profits.

In February, Netflix outlined password-sharing guidance in four countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. The company said it would ask users in those countries to set a ‚Äúprimary location‚Äù for their accounts, and allow users to establish up to two ‚Äúsub accounts‚Äù for those who don‚Äôt live in their home base for extra fees.

The company has yet to provide password-sharing guidance for the U.S., although it is expected to do so this year.",2023-04-18,569,135

**Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.

**Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.

12okhx5_UAL,UAL,"Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.","## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.

11p3peh_NFLX,NFLX,$NFLX: Will Netflix‚Äôs Goliath Presence Last Forever? | Double-Down on this Front-Runner,"**$NFLX: Will Netflix‚Äôs Goliath Presence Last Forever? | Double-Down on this Front-Runner** 

In 1997, Netflix pioneered the digital-streaming services and bankrupted Blockbuster, capitalizing on an untapped customer segment. By 2020, Netflix reached 183 million paying subscribers and climbed upwards of 209 million subscribers, remaining dominant as the largest subscription service. However, competitors (examples include Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, and Disney) soon mimicked their platform and stole market share through diversifying their collections and offering more affordable prices. Copying Apple TV‚Äôs business model, Netflix decided to implement advertising into their platform.¬†

**Will Netflix‚Äôs Ad-Strategy Doom the Company for Failure? Or Will the Company Rebound in 2023 to Approach Pandemic Activity Levels?** 

**Bear Market: Post-Pandemic Fears Crumbling Netflix‚Äôs Future** 

In 2022, Netflix‚Äôs share prices plummeted 60%, making them the fourth-worst performer in the NASDAQ 100 Index. At the end of 2022, Netflix announced that their user base decreased for the first quarter since 2011, causing panic among investors. Investors formed a pessimistic outlook of the company: Netflix appeared unsuccessful to maintain their pandemic-level surges. Goldman Sachs recently announced that the consumer recession and increased competitive landscape in the online streaming industry caused their bearish perspective.¬†

In November 2021, Netflix heavily invested in Netflix Games, a gaming option, but only 1% of subscribers engaged in the platform in 2022. Netflix appears to continue wasting its resources and capital into funding this initiative with no signs of popularity or growth. Netflix attempts to penetrate the video gaming market; however, none of their games have compared to competitors like Activision Blizzard, Nintendo, Sony, or Electronic Arts. Netflix‚Äôs competitors offer bundles and hardware for customers to experience a more intimate experience unlike Netflix‚Äôs capabilities to match these products.¬†

**Bull Market: Short-Sellers Are Panicking at 2023‚Äôs Stock Performance** 

According to the Wall Street Journal, Netflix hopes to continue advertising their brands to reach 40 million viewers by the third quarter in 2023, coining this channel as ‚ÄúBasic with Ads‚Äù (costing $6.99/month). Advertisers have ‚Äúoverwhelming interest‚Äù in this option; however, Netflix seeks high-pricing to run their advertisements. Historically, Netflix relied on word-of-mouth advertising to spread awareness from their popular Original Series Netflix-exclusive content. However, investors reason this alternative strategy to capitalize on new customers can accelerate revenue growth. The altercation of Netflix‚Äôs business model hopes to increase its target audience by providing cheaper options to customers.¬†

Beyond customer loyalty towards Netflix, they continuously remain the key player through their innovative releases, offering for the first time a global streaming event on March 4, 2023. Netflix intends to supplement their comedic selection with an immersive, live viewing to attract customers to the platform. Also, in alignment with live-airing, they plan to stream the SAG Awards in 2024. The event intends to include stars like Chris Rock, Amy Schumer, Jerry Seinfeld, David Spade, Kareem Adbul-Jabbar, and many other notable celebrities.¬†

Also, Netflix addressed the issue of sharing passwords with friends and family to increase paid-subscriber growth. Approximately, 100 million people watch Netflix using a friend‚Äôs or family‚Äôs account, so Netflix will restrict subscription services to only households. Netflix recognized that this policy will attract negative publicity in the short-term, infuriating customers, but customers will eventually pay for the service to watch its Netflix-exclusive content. Netflix announced this plan will ‚Äúmonetize account sharing ‚Ä¶ \[in\] early 2023‚Äù, so the company can expect a profitable start to the year.¬†

I ended up cancelling my limit orders at 1600'ish. The stock has since rallied at least 100% and NFLX seems to be defying odds, also introducing new features and plans as well as expanding into so many (developing) countries such as within Africa with plans to produce local content across different regions etc.

Over the past 25 years Netflix alternated the film and television industry forever. In the early 2000s Netflix founders offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for 50 million, an offer which they turned down, in due course Netflix triumphed over Blockbuster and forced the movie industry to adapt. However in the last year their long streak of unaltered growth came to a halt. 

Netflix was one of lockdown's sweet stocks, however after their all time high Netflix fell over 70%, for a combined reason of increased competition and a fall in followers.

In Q2, Netflix reportedly lost 970,000 subscribers, while their competitor disney plus gained 14.4 million, causing Netflix‚Äôs stock price to reach a valuation of 180. This is the first time that Netflix‚Äôs stock price was under 200 since 2017. 

Due to their recent fall, Netflix is planning on re-inventing themselves. One of their ideas would be to add a new and cheaper subscription option which includes advertising. This Idea is already up and running in the U.S since November and Netflix say they are ‚Äúhappy with the results‚Äù. Nonetheless, Investors have mixed feelings about whether or not including ads would be lucrative for the company. Additionally, It is estimated that Netflix loses around 6 billion dollars in revenue every year due to password sharing. Hence another project Netflix is striving for is to crack down on password sharing. 

Fundamentals

(Netflix)

* 60% of Netflix revenues come from outside the U.S, by consequence the surge in the dollar in comparison to other currencies impacted Netflix negatively. 
* In the past 6 months, Netflix‚Äôs stock price increased over 50%.
* Netflix‚Äôs revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year, driven by a 6% increase in average paid memberships. 
* For 2022, Netflix finished with 231M paid memberships and generated $32B of revenue, $5.6B in operating income, $2.0B of net cash from operating activities and $1.6B of free cash flow 
* In 2023 Netflix stated that they expect at least 3 billion in free cash flow assuming no f/x (special effects) costs
* Currently Netflix's share price is $342.50. Netflix's Revenue per Share for the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended in Dec. 2022 was $70.06. Hence, Netflix's PS (**Price to Sales)** Ratio for today is 4.89: 
* According to Netflix's latest financial reports and stock price the company's current **price-to-earnings** ratio (TTM) is 29.8445.
* During the past 5 years Netflix‚Äôs **PS** ratio has gone down, with its highest at 14.65 in 2018 and its lowest at 2.7 in may of 2022

(Disney plus) 

* In 2021 Disney plus added 7.6 million subscribers from 38.8 million to 46.4 million subscribers
* Disney + is not lucrative yet and is not planning on becoming lucrative until 2024.
* The average monthly revenue per paying subscriber decreased from 2021 to 2022 from 6.81 to 6.1

Going forward

On January 19, Netflix published its final quarter of 2022 financial statement. 

Netflix recorded a revenue of almost 8 billion dollars, and a net income of 1.4 billion dollars. Furthermore, Netflix documented an exponential surge in their number of subscribers which joined in the 4th quarter compared to how much they expected, 7.66 million new subscribers compared to their expected 4.57 million. This caused their stock price to increase over 8% in a single day. 

Moreover, the Netflix co-founder Read Hastings announced that he will step down as ceo of Netflix appointing former chief operating officer Greg Peters to have executive power over the company alongside Ted Sarandos.

Personally, I believe that Netflix would be a good investment, considering they are still over 50% down from their all time high. Additionally, I think that if done correctly adding advertisements to Netflix has the possibility to be highly lucrative in the future.

Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

Even though I know this is the wrong thing to do, I may again add, but only a 0.1% tranche...and only if 1) price reaches over 370; 2) volume is lighter than today; and 3) options price falls sub-2.00 -- if these conditions happen, then we may see a reversal off what would be a 3-day surge on falling volume.

**Last Week ‚Äì Positive reactions to CPI and Bank earnings.**

SPY closed 2.7% higher last week. That was slightly more than the 2.2% move options were pricing. Stocks reacted positively to the CPI data and closed the week on another positive note following a slew of large bank earnings. Implied volatility in options contracted following the CPI release. It wasn‚Äôt as apparent in the VIX as it fell from and already low 21 the prior week to 19.5 as of Friday, but it was apparent in IV near term, as SPY options pricing he uncertainty of the CPI print were around 27 IV, now near term IV is in the low teens. That is despite the fact that earnings season picks up and headline risk around the debt ceiling negotiations. More on that in a bit.

**This Week ‚Äì¬†(Relatively) Low IV into the heart of earnings season.**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.3% move for this 4-day week. Implied vol in SPY options is just 13 for this Friday. In QQQ IV is 17 for this Friday, with a 1.7% expected move. IV is the lowest we‚Äôve seen in some time, despite the slew of earnings on deck. That in turn means IV in individual names may be the lowest they‚Äôve been into an earnings event in some time. That‚Äôs something to keep in mind with any new option positions around earnings events.

IV does start to pick back up the first week of February around the next FOMC meetings and CPI/NFP economic data. In other words, macroeconomic news is still the driver of high option vol until it isn‚Äôt.

## Earnings Trading with (Relatively) Low IV

As mentioned above we enter this earnings season with a relatively different set-up than earnings seasons over the past 1-2 years. Implied Vol has come in quite a bit following some re-assuring inflation data and traders are perhaps seeing light at the end of the Fed rate hike tunnel. During the recent bouts of market volatility, options needed to price an earnings event, *but also* the potential for a broad market swoon that day or that week, Therefore, earnings expected moves weren‚Äôt necessarily pure reflections of that company‚Äôs earnings, but also carried overall market baggage. A hypothetical example from the past year would be a company with interest rate sensitivity reporting earnings the same week as important inflation data. Are options pricing earnings, or inflation, and how much of each? In a lot of cases, traders were probably more worried about the next year of Fed moves than that company‚Äôs prior quarter.

With IV lower into this earnings season, we get a clearer view of options pricing company-specific moves. And perhaps with the VIX near 19 and index IV over the next few weeks lower than we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, it‚Äôs possible we may see individual company options actually weighed down by low index vol. Not to mention, we‚Äôve gone from ignoring the importance of the prior quarter because of uncertainty ahead, to now having a little more certainty ahead, but really curious about what all this stuff has done to that company‚Äôs earnings recently. So, it‚Äôs a different earnings environment this time around.

Let‚Äôs take a look at Goldman Sachs, which reports tomorrow morning. Obviously, the large investment banks have been volatile over the past year as traders tried to get a read on interest rates, borrowing costs, banking/M&A activity, and more. In fact, Goldman‚Äôs realized vol, or how much the stock has moved over the past year is about 29. That can be compared to IV for this week‚Äôs earnings in GS, which is about 25. Quick translation: options are actually cheaper into this earnings than GS stock has traded on average over the past year. And looking at the expected move for GS for this week we see options pricing a 2.6% move, or about $10 in either direction. For comparison, with the market rally off the CPI, and then a sympathetic rally with fellow financial institutions like JPM off their earnings on Friday, GS was up 6%, or $21 last week. And that‚Äôs without knowing what they‚Äôll report tomorrow.

With that information at hand, it may make sense to compare credit and debit spreads to express a view. Typically credit spreads into earnings take advantage of high implied vol, and build a buffer of not only the potential move in the stock, but also by being on the correct side of falling IV after the event. But in this case, it‚Äôs helpful to look at the risk/reward of credit vs debit spreads when IV isn‚Äôt sky-high.

Let‚Äôs say you want to take a bearish stance on GS earnings, based on the rally into the event. Based on Goldman‚Äôs close of 374 on Friday, an at-the-money credit call spread for this week with the upper strike set at the expected move (selling the 375 call, buying the 385 call) risks about 6.50 to make 3.50. It loses money if GS stock is above 378.50 on Friday, just 4.50 higher than Friday‚Äôs close. Compare that to an at-the-money debit put spread (buying the 375 put, selling the 365 put) that risks 4 to make 6, with a breakeven around 371, just $3 lower in the stock: (see the trade here on [Options AI's free tool](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/GS/put-spread))

This is a case where the breakevens of credit spreads are really tight, compared to how the stock has been trading, as are the breakevens of debit spreads. The issue with debit spreads is always that you need a move in your direction, while with credit spreads you have a buffer built in to be slightly wrong. But in low IV environments that advantage starts to blur, and the risk/reward of what seem like very likely moves can come into better focus.

**Last Week ‚Äì Positive reactions to CPI and Bank earnings.**

SPY closed 2.7% higher last week. That was slightly more than the 2.2% move options were pricing. Stocks reacted positively to the CPI data and closed the week on another positive note following a slew of large bank earnings. Implied volatility in options contracted following the CPI release. It wasn‚Äôt as apparent in the VIX as it fell from and already low 21 the prior week to 19.5 as of Friday, but it was apparent in IV near term, as SPY options pricing he uncertainty of the CPI print were around 27 IV, now near term IV is in the low teens. That is despite the fact that earnings season picks up and headline risk around the debt ceiling negotiations. More on that in a bit.

**This Week ‚Äì¬†(Relatively) Low IV into the heart of earnings season.**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.3% move for this 4-day week. Implied vol in SPY options is just 13 for this Friday. In QQQ IV is 17 for this Friday, with a 1.7% expected move. IV is the lowest we‚Äôve seen in some time, despite the slew of earnings on deck. That in turn means IV in individual names may be the lowest they‚Äôve been into an earnings event in some time. That‚Äôs something to keep in mind with any new option positions around earnings events.

IV does start to pick back up the first week of February around the next FOMC meetings and CPI/NFP economic data. In other words, macroeconomic news is still the driver of high option vol until it isn‚Äôt.

## Earnings Trading with (Relatively) Low IV

As mentioned above we enter this earnings season with a relatively different set-up than earnings seasons over the past 1-2 years. Implied Vol has come in quite a bit following some re-assuring inflation data and traders are perhaps seeing light at the end of the Fed rate hike tunnel. During the recent bouts of market volatility, options needed to price an earnings event, *but also* the potential for a broad market swoon that day or that week, Therefore, earnings expected moves weren‚Äôt necessarily pure reflections of that company‚Äôs earnings, but also carried overall market baggage. A hypothetical example from the past year would be a company with interest rate sensitivity reporting earnings the same week as important inflation data. Are options pricing earnings, or inflation, and how much of each? In a lot of cases, traders were probably more worried about the next year of Fed moves than that company‚Äôs prior quarter.

With IV lower into this earnings season, we get a clearer view of options pricing company-specific moves. And perhaps with the VIX near 19 and index IV over the next few weeks lower than we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, it‚Äôs possible we may see individual company options actually weighed down by low index vol. Not to mention, we‚Äôve gone from ignoring the importance of the prior quarter because of uncertainty ahead, to now having a little more certainty ahead, but really curious about what all this stuff has done to that company‚Äôs earnings recently. So, it‚Äôs a different earnings environment this time around.

Let‚Äôs take a look at Goldman Sachs, which reports tomorrow morning. Obviously, the large investment banks have been volatile over the past year as traders tried to get a read on interest rates, borrowing costs, banking/M&A activity, and more. In fact, Goldman‚Äôs realized vol, or how much the stock has moved over the past year is about 29. That can be compared to IV for this week‚Äôs earnings in GS, which is about 25. Quick translation: options are actually cheaper into this earnings than GS stock has traded on average over the past year. And looking at the expected move for GS for this week we see options pricing a 2.6% move, or about $10 in either direction. For comparison, with the market rally off the CPI, and then a sympathetic rally with fellow financial institutions like JPM off their earnings on Friday, GS was up 6%, or $21 last week. And that‚Äôs without knowing what they‚Äôll report tomorrow.

With that information at hand, it may make sense to compare credit and debit spreads to express a view. Typically credit spreads into earnings take advantage of high implied vol, and build a buffer of not only the potential move in the stock, but also by being on the correct side of falling IV after the event. But in this case, it‚Äôs helpful to look at the risk/reward of credit vs debit spreads when IV isn‚Äôt sky-high.

Let‚Äôs say you want to take a bearish stance on GS earnings, based on the rally into the event. Based on Goldman‚Äôs close of 374 on Friday, an at-the-money credit call spread for this week with the upper strike set at the expected move (selling the 375 call, buying the 385 call) risks about 6.50 to make 3.50. It loses money if GS stock is above 378.50 on Friday, just 4.50 higher than Friday‚Äôs close. Compare that to an at-the-money debit put spread (buying the 375 put, selling the 365 put) that risks 4 to make 6, with a breakeven around 371, just $3 lower in the stock: (see the trade here on [Options AI's free tool](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/GS/put-spread))

This is a case where the breakevens of credit spreads are really tight, compared to how the stock has been trading, as are the breakevens of debit spreads. The issue with debit spreads is always that you need a move in your direction, while with credit spreads you have a buffer built in to be slightly wrong. But in low IV environments that advantage starts to blur, and the risk/reward of what seem like very likely moves can come into better focus.

1097x21_NFLX,NFLX,Netflix is the worst FAANGM investment and it's getting worse,"Source: The FAANMGs: Google Is A Buy, Netflix Is A Goodbye

NFLX holds $6.1 billion in cash equivalents and has $13.9b in long-term debt. Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.

NFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.

Competition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.

However, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry $717 million in 3Q22.

Furthermore, while the other five FAANMG‚Äôs have investment grade credit ratings, Moody's still rates NFLX at Ba1/positive, a notch below investment grade.

Analysts‚Äô price targets support my observations. The average 12-month price target for META, AAPL, and MSFT are each roughly 30% higher than the current share prices. AMZN and GOOGL have price targets that are 66% and 61.7% above the current share valuations, respectively.

My Nflx is up $54 at up 22.99%, lol. how are your stocks doing?","U.S. stocks soared on Friday as investors parsed through a medley of corporate financial results and pondered the possibility Federal Reserve officials may ease aggressive rate increases sooner than anticipated.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 (\^GSPC) marched up 2.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) rallied more than 700 points, or 2.5%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) gained 2.3%. Treasuries retreated after a relentless climb in recent days that saw the benchmark 10-year note temporarily rise above 4.3%, a level not seen since 2008.

&#x200B;

In remarks at a meeting Friday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank should avoid tipping the economy into an ""unforced downturn"" and that it was time to consider easing the pace of hikes.

&#x200B;

Investors also assessed a Wall Street Journal report earlier in the day indicating Fed policymakers are poised to deliver another interest rate increase of 0.75% at their meeting Nov. 1-2 and but are expected to discuss the possibility of a smaller increase in December.

&#x200B;

Even with the past two down days, equities closed the week out sharply higher thanks to mega rallies on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre closer to the end than we are to the beginning, and the more bear market rallies we see, the fewer are left before we finally flush it all out,‚Äù SoFi's Head of Investment Strategy Liz Young said in a note. ‚ÄúStill some more things to check off the list, but if or when earnings crack and just before economic data falls into contraction conditions, is when you start to pounce on market opportunities ‚Äì that could be just around the corner.‚Äù

Third-quarter earnings season has so far held up better than many analysts have expected, with beats from companies like Netflix (NFLX), AT&T (T), and IBM (IBM) countered by big misses from names such as Snap (SNAP), which tumbled 28% Friday after disappointing Wall Street with its results.

&#x200B;

The social media platform reported a fifth-straight quarterly deceleration, along with lackluster profits and a warning that sales trends in the current three-month period may get worse.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúIt's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory,‚Äù Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note. ‚ÄúThe weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats.‚Äù

&#x200B;

**Last Week ‚Äì**¬†SPY was lower by about 1.5% last week. That was inside the 2.9% move options were pricing. Similar to the 1.5% move higher 2 weeks ago, markets were much more volatile intra-week than the final result would indicate. Thursday saw a big rally that broke a 6 day losing streak, but those gains were short-lived as stocks were once again steeply lower on Friday. Treasury yields and the dollar continue to be the main drivers of the day-to-day swings. Earnings season picks up in intensity the next few weeks and that may begin to move the broader markets as well.

Implied volatility remained near the highs of the year with the VIX once again closing the week near 32.

**This Week ‚Äì**¬†SPY options are pricing about a 2.7% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $11 in either direction.

## Bullish by Not Being Bearish

The past few weeks we‚Äôve detailed a few strategies for a high-vol environment, including selling high IV (and wide expected moves) via Iron Condors as well using credit put spreads in potentially oversold stocks while not needing a rally to hold (just the stock to stop going lower). We‚Äôll check in first with the credit put spread examples from Oct 2nd‚Äôs post that expire this week.

The first was the GOOGL -96/+91 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), which could be sold at around 1.90 at the time, with the stock trading 95.80 It could be bought to close for about 1.40 at Friday‚Äôs close. The second was the GOOGL -91/+90 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), also with the stock trading 95.80. At the time it could be sold at roughly 0.26, it could be bought to close this past Friday for about 0.12.

GOOGL stock is only higher by about a dollar since then and hasn‚Äôt been much lower than where the stock was when those trade examples were detailed. The key point here is that buying calls or even call spreads in a high implied vol environment is difficult because rallies in the stock have not been sustainable. Buying premium needs a large sustained move to be right when vol is this high. But selling premium in high vol allows for some wiggle room, and can be best described in this case as being bullish, by not being bearish.

Continuing on that theme, here‚Äôs a comparison of an at-the-money call, and an at-the-money credit put spread in QQQ, expiring Nov 21st:

&#x200B;

As you can see, the two trades risk about the same amount. However, buying the call needs QQQ above $273.25, while the credit put spread needs QQQ to not be below $254.45. Obviously, the credit put spread can only make $657, while the potential gains on the call are unlimited. But‚Ä¶ The call needs QQQ to be nearly $19 higher from its current level before it would make the same.

Again, this is just an example. QQQ will see some of its biggest names report earnings over the next few weeks and that credit put spread could easily be underwater. But the risk is defined, and the chances of it being a complete loss are much lower than buying calls, especially with implied vol so high.

**Note about my day trading strategy:** I only trade 3 patterns (and their variations): pullbacks, consolidation breakouts, and climactic reversals. I follow trending stocks using the following timeframes:  
\-Patterns and setups identified off the 5-min  
\-The 2-min is used to fine tune entries  
\-The 15-min for multiple timeframe alignment (MTFA)  
\-Hourly and daily for bias and support/resistance areas  
\-General trade management: exit in halves or all-or-nothing (AON) towards target

vjqpwn_NFLX,NFLX,Do you think NFLX will maintain its market leadership?," Netflix announced it laid off 300 employees in a second round of job cuts after losing subscribers for the first time in more than a decade.

The cuts amounted to about 4% of the streaming giant‚Äôs workforce, and mostly affected US employees. They came after the company cut 150 jobs last month.

‚ÄúWhile we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth,‚Äù Netflix said in a statement.

My criteria for companies are those who have high capital expenditure, worsening consumer demand and things which people will drop first in the face of economic hardship. 

To me Netflix best fits this description. I was frankly shocked when I heard about Bill Ackmans bet a few months ago. As many people have already said the product is getting worse, the company needs to spend huge on exclusive content to keep people around and to make matters worse they have a moat that is being drained day by day due to the amount of streaming services producing their own content. 

None of this is news to most people but having the confidence to short is something I see as really important as a way to generate income to put into stocks which are already undervalued and bring hit. Netflix has already fallen huge and there is still a long way to go. I honestly believe their members will be going down a lot over the next year due to people cutting costs and the lack of content and high price.

urowhk_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX ready to turn?,"Michael Pachter of Wedbush was just on the TV talking about reversing his short since they've dropped so much (600s to high 100s).

He made a couple of key points. One being that the market appears to be pricing Netflix to go to zero subscribers which he believes it's not.

They've lost a couple of million subscribers in each of the last two reports, but they're also looking at creating an ad-supported tier.

He said that he believes that Netflix is going continue to to be the anchor subscription for streaming. I don't happen to believe that. I think that Disney+, which is much cheaper and owns all of the key intellectual properties, does the highest quality family content, and has a huge offscreen ecosystem driving brand loyalty, is already the anchor subscription, which is helping drive NFLX down.

He also compared streaming to restaurants, calling Netflix the Taco Bell of streaming where HBO was the Ruth's Chris or Morton's steakhouse.

So what else is going on to make it a buy or continued short? Or should it just be forgotten?

There's a Forbes link I'll add in a comment.

Edit: Disclaimer: After thinking about it the ad-supported revenue stream is going to be the key here. They left that on the table for a decade and a half, and it's free money at this point.

I also think they're going to stop screwing around and start making better content to try to build subscriptions again.

However, NFLX after almost 70% of market cap wipe out looks like a good opportunity for multiple reasons

1). Apple TV+ hasn't been a clear success
2). With AMZN spending as high as $1B on just something like LOTR show, paying $90B for NFLX for their whole catalog and 220M subscribers doesn't seem that crazy
3). Data, netflix has lot of untapped data that can be used wisely. What people watch, and huge international audience

Twitter (TWTR) saw more headlines last week, many of them breaking on the platform, and Elon Musk‚Äôs account. Following a week where the stock was 18% higher, the stock was basically unchanged last week, Options were pricing about a 5.5% move last week and about 13% for the rest of April. Options are pricing a roughly 9% move this week, and despite a week passing, 13% to the end of April. The company is due to report earnings April 28th.

The stock is now near the midpoint of where it was just before the original Musk news (just below $40) and the highs it reached after (near $53). The 13% expected move for the end of April (that includes earnings) puts a bullish and bearish options consensus roughly inline with those two levels. Musk proposed a bid to take the company private at $54.20 a share but the Twitter board enacted a poison pill strategy to prevent a takeover.

A dollar wide-winged Iron Condor expiring April 29th, with short strikes set at 41 and 53 is priced to risk roughly $55 to make up to $45 (using the mid). That range is in-line with the move options are pricing and the short strike on the upside is right near Musk‚Äôs stated price. Options have a tendency to price the obvious at times and in this case those are the levels everyone is focused on. You can see that range and the risk/reward on the chart below:

**Last Week ‚Äì** SPY was lower by about 2.3% last week, a larger move than the 1.4% options were pricing. Implied volatility was slightly higher on the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move this week (about $6 in either direction) into Thursday‚Äôs close. Markets are closed on Friday.

**Implied Volatility / VIX ‚Äì** The VIX once again crept higher, moving from 21 the prior week to just under 23 to end last week. It remains higher than historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1.8%** (about $8)
* QQQ **2.6%** (about $9)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5)
* DIA **1.5%** (about $5)

### In the News

Twitter (TWTR) saw more headlines last week, many of them breaking on the platform, and Elon Musk‚Äôs account. Following a week where the stock was 18% higher, the stock was basically unchanged last week, Options were pricing about a 5.5% move last week and about 13% for the rest of April. Options are pricing a roughly 9% move this week, and despite a week passing, 13% to the end of April. The company is due to report earnings April 28th.

The stock is now near the midpoint of where it was just before the original Musk news (just below $40) and the highs it reached after (near $53). The 13% expected move for the end of April (that includes earnings) puts a bullish and bearish options consensus roughly inline with those two levels. Musk proposed a bid to take the company private at $54.20 a share but the Twitter board enacted a poison pill strategy to prevent a takeover.

A dollar wide-winged Iron Condor expiring April 29th, with short strikes set at 41 and 53 is priced to risk roughly $55 to make up to $45 (using the mid). That range is in-line with the move options are pricing and the short strike on the upside is right near Musk‚Äôs stated price. Options have a tendency to price the obvious at times and in this case those are the levels everyone is focused on. You can see that range and the risk/reward on the chart below:

tkvwri_NET,NET,$RDBX - The Next NetFlix on The Rise,"#  Their all going to laugh at you is what my wife said.....

They laughed when Billionaire Investor **Carl C. Icahn**, when he decided to make an investment in a mail order video company called **Netflix**...

I am no **Carl C. Icahn**, but I do know how to read a Vision, monitor a Chart and see the possibilities of growth - HUGE growth and if you have not logged into $RDBX website and seen what is planned for 2022 - YOU are missing out on MONEY my dear fellow and lady Retail Investors - **Redbox Entertainment Inc.** is The Next **Netflix**!!! starting now in War-time, Down Market

Here is what I do know, $RDBX/ **Redbox Entertainment Inc.**, formerly Seaport Global Acquisition Corp., is an entertainment company. The Company provides consumers access to a variety of content across digital and physical media. It operates a digital streaming service that provides both advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) and paid movies from Hollywood studios and content partners, as well as channels of free advertisement supported streaming television (FAST).

As they (RedBox) $RDBX move away from the KIOSK ONLY system as Netflix moved away from mail-order - Its Redbox application is available on entertainment platforms that include Roku devices, connected televisions (TVs), gaming platforms, the Web as well iOS and Android devices.

Redbox application also operates its kiosks across the United States at thousands of retail locations giving consumers access to the entertainment. It produces, acquires, and distributes movies through its Redbox Entertainment label, providing rights to films that are distributed across Redbox‚Äôs digital and physical services as well as through third-party digital services.

sa08b5_NFLX,NFLX,Is Netflix at a crossroads?,"Netflix (NFLX) plummeted on Friday following company's Q4 earnings report. It is currently trading at $397, down over 21% from $508 and over 42% below all time highs in mid November 2021.

¬†
A first glance at NFLX financial results point to a strong end of 2021 however:
¬†

-¬†Subs: Up by¬†8.3m¬†in Q4 (shy of 8.5m forecast) and total¬†221.8m¬†(up by 9% YoY)
-¬†Revenue:¬†US$29.7bn¬†(up by 19% YoY)
-¬†Net income:¬†US$5.12bn¬†(up by 82% YoY)
-¬†EPS:¬†$11.24¬†(up from $6.08 FY20)*
-¬†Net margin:¬†17%¬†(up from 11% in FY20)

¬†
After Friday's sell off, NFLX is trading close to pre-pandemic levels. Is this an opportunity to buy or should investors be mindful of future prospects?
¬†
I argue that Netflix is at an important crossroads that will define the future of the company (and investor's returns over the next few years).
¬†
The striking point of the earnings report was management guidance for net subscription adds in Q1'22, which were somewhat worryingly pessimistic. Q1 has historically seen very strong subs growth with an average of 8.6m net adds over the past 5 years. This year's forecast is 2.5m or down 70% from that average.
¬†
This clearly shows that Netflix is struggling to keep up with previous subscription growth. In the earnings call, management failed to identify clear underlying reasons for this, but I believe it is broadly attributed to:

¬†
- Natural pull back from above average growth seen during pandemic times.
- Key markets like UCAN and EMEA are reaching saturation levels. In USA and Canada net adds have been stagnant at c.65% market penetration rate over past few years.
- Growing competition elsewhere. And I don't only mean Disney+ or Amazon Video (which are ramping up high quality content by the way) but all other ways of entertainment including the fact that people can now leave their homes.
- Finally, (and lets be honest here) poor quality releases over the last year, particularly in movies. Huge personal disappointment has been ""Dont Look Up"". I cant remember any other time where I've not been able to watch a Di Caprio movie until the end.
¬†
Subscription growth is the main driver of top-line revenue growth. The only other lever left is rising prices. Management understands that and recently announced price increases for all subscription packages in USA and Canada. This hints that future subscription adds will mostly come from less penetrated markets such as LATAM and Asia Pacific which have a much lower (55%) ARPU yields.

¬†
Company's Valuation and expected returns:

¬†
As mentioned at the beginning, I believe Netflix is at a crossroads and future will depend on management response to the current market situation. I have modelled two possible scenarios reflecting this.

¬†
Sc1.-¬†Management continues exactly with the same business model. In this scenario, company growth will continue to decelerate and valuation metric will compress further (PE is currently 35, the lowest it's been in the last 10 years). Netflix has now reached a healthy financial position with handsome profit margins and income levels. These will continue to increase (albeit at decelerating levels) as economies of scale continue to play up.
In this scenario, modelling presents 31% upside (or 6% pa) from today's price.

¬†
Sc2.-¬†Management drives to introduce new and additional ways on entertainment. I personally think this is the most probable scenario because in some way, Netflix has already started this journey. Netflix has made initial steps in 2021 to get into the video-game space including the acquisition of Oxenfree, its first game studio. There are huge opportunities for growth if Netflix plays this card well including its potential to embrace the metaverse.

¬†
It wouldn't be the first time Netflix re-invents themselves to adapt to new market opportunities. Remember Netflix was a DVD by mail company in its origins and then reinvented themselves to exploit emerging opportunities offered by the¬†dot.com¬†era and become largest platform offering stream content. And then after that, they started the journey to produce their own original content.
¬†
The possibilities in this scenario are vast. Modelling considers a very conservative penetration in the gaming arena, yielding only modest additional users and price hikes compare to Scenario 1. For this to be successful, Netflix will need to increase current levels of expenditure to produce high-quality games. Therefore I forecast a net margin and income drop in the short to medium term.
In this scenario, modelling presents 92% upside (or 14% pa) from today's price.

¬†
Conclusion:
I believe that following the recent price sell off, Netflix presents interesting possibilities for investors. In the worst case scenario, Netflix could return c.6% pa to investors. Whilst this is not particularly attractive, it is arguably better than other conservative ways of investing such as government bonds. The upside case for Netflix is undefined. However, if the company can only capture a small piece of the gaming industry, returns from todays' stock price could be eye watering.

Here‚Äôs a look at an Iron Condor in the Feb 18th (monthly) expiry. The short strikes of the fly set at the recent support and resistance. You‚Äôll note that is roughly in line with the expected move options are pricing. The risk/reward of the $5 winged Condor is about 2.70 to 2.30. In other words, options are pricing a move to recent support or resistance for earnings, and a breakout or breakdown would mean options were underpriced into the event. (via Options AI):

s4z9ru_NFLX,NFLX,"OOM NFLX option gained 6,500% in just 5 minutes"," 

After NFLX increased their prices in the USA/Canada yesterday, the stock saw a pump from 515$ -> $535 (3.88%)

If we consider the Jan 14, 520 Call, it went from $0.24 to $16.00 (6,500%) from 3:00 - 3:05.

How does a < 5% gain in a stock lead to a 6,500% gain on an option?

There are a couple of things I understood (I'm still new to this topic)

1. An OOM option went ITM, and that usually results in a lot of % gain
2. The option was 0DTE, so there would be higher fluctuations in the red or green
3. The IV was pretty normal

I can't confirm #3 (where can I see history volatility?), but NFLX traded pretty flat that entire day.

I would expect the option to definitely increase, but 6,500% in just 5 minutes?

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we‚Äôll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I‚Äôm really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don‚Äôt like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that‚Äôs not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren‚Äôt priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren‚Äôt priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I‚Äôm genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they‚Äôll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we‚Äôve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we‚Äôre bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we‚Äôll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we‚Äôll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won‚Äôt get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-17,28,19

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was higher by about 1.9% last week, more than the 1.3% move options were pricing.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 1% move (or about $4.50 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$446** that corresponds to just above **$450** on the upside and below **$442** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX ended Friday around 16, down from 19 the week before. The VIX is now below its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping, but January futures were down from last week, now just under 23.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **1.6%**
* DIA **1.1%**

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we‚Äôll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I‚Äôm really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don‚Äôt like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that‚Äôs not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren‚Äôt priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren‚Äôt priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I‚Äôm genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they‚Äôll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we‚Äôve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we‚Äôre bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we‚Äôll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we‚Äôll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won‚Äôt get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",2021-10-17,28,19

>Netflix differs from movie studios and TV networks in that it doesn‚Äôt generate sales based on specific titles, instead using¬†its catalog and a steady drumbeat of new releases to entice customers every week. But the company does have a wealth of¬†data concerning what its customers watch, which the company uses to determine the value derived from individual programs.

The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize,¬†generated $891.1 million in impact value, a¬†metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode. Those figures are just for the first season, and stem from a document that details Netflix‚Äôs performance metrics for the show.

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was higher by about 1.9% last week, more than the 1.3% move options were pricing.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 1% move (or about $4.50 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$446** that corresponds to just above **$450** on the upside and below **$442** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX ended Friday around 16, down from 19 the week before. The VIX is now below its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping, but January futures were down from last week, now just under 23.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **1.6%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here‚Äôs an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $442 and $450 to see Max Gain:

## In the News

OPEC reached a deal on Sunday to increase oil production into year-end. Oil prices are near their highest levels of the past 2 years.

Options in the US Crude fund USO are pricing about a 7% move over the next month (Aug 20), corresponding. to about $52 for a bullish expected move and $45 for bearish.

## Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

Earnings season began last week with some of the major financial institutions. The bank stocks didn‚Äôt see large initial earnings moves (beyond what options were pricing) but sold off Friday with the broader market with most lower by more than what options had priced for their earnings weeks. Here's a look at some of the bigger names reporting this week. Links go the Options AI Calendar with charts and prior moves. The recent moves listed below start with the most recent and go back in time to the prior quarters.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through as well, whom I'm expecting beats from all across the board. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [collateral plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Steel stocks move in tandem with one another.** $CLF and $NUE will put up their numbers on Thursday morning, and the market will then price ***all other steel stocks accordingly***. That means if $CLF/$NUE are up, the rest of steel gang will also be up bigly. The flipside is also true. If either tanks, they'll take down the respective companies. If you're looking to make a steel play, I would look to play $MT or $X options instead of $CLF/$NUE options, as they will move roughly the same amount, **but they won't get IV crushed.** Those looking to roll the dice should look to enter a position Wednesday before close, as that's when the options will be the cheapest (thanks to theta gang).

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks also move in tandem with each other.** Similar to above, $AAL, $LUV and $ALK all report Thursday morning. If you're looking to make a collateral play, look to play $DAL or something to avoid the IV crush. ***Alternatively***, you can also look to go long or short on the entire sector through $JETS. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we‚Äôll get huge gains on a relatively small move. This is key, since we‚Äôre going to get a large move in $JETS as the *entire sector* will fly (lol) or crash after Thursday since the market will price all airline stocks, not just $AAL and $LUV, based off of the $AAL and $LUV earnings. On average, airlines move around 4.5% post earnings, so we should see a comparable movement in $JETS. If we get such a move in $JETS, we‚Äôll have at minimum a five bagger on deck. More information about this [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *under 6%* on both sides of the chain. What really makes this pricing weird is the fact that Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO. If you're gambling on this one, the odds are *really* in your favour. That being said, maybe Wall Street knows something, I've honestly got no idea. The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true.

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

As you can see, over the last two earnings, analyst buy ratings (shown by the green ""B"") have not been a short-term bullish signal for NFLX. As the chart shows, the price has dropped after both of these events and these earnings moves were sold regardless if it was a gap up or gap down after the news was released.

As far as longer-term goes, over the last year, there have been 40 analyst ""buy"" ratings vs. only 6 analyst ""sell"" ratings with the stock price being up about 25% from last May. In this case, this suggests that there may be delay in analyst ""buy"" ratings and price action reflecting the bullish sentiment over the longer-term side of things.

‚ÄúWe believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,‚Äù Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,‚Äù

‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,‚Äù 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That‚Äôs expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

**The Markets**

**Last Week ‚Äì** The **SPY** closed Friday at new highs, up about **1.6%** on the week. Once again, that move was beyond what options were pricing (1.1%). The outsized move higher was not enough to affect implied volatility. The **VIX** was down slightly on the week, closing near 16.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$413** as a *bearish consensus* and **$421** as a *bullish consensus.*

**Expected Moves for This Week (April 19th):**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.5%
* IWM 1.9%

Although the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020. It has spent the last few months compressing from the 30‚Äôs to where it is now and as the past several weeks have shown, it is able to move in one direction (higher) beyond where options are pricing.

Earnings season heats up even more this week. Low levels of market volatility affect options pricing in individual stocks, and there is always the possibility of idiosyncratic moves (on earnings misses or beats) that will be difficult for options to isolate ahead of time. Translation: Options need to price the fact that stocks aren't moving around much day to day, then they need to price the possibility of a big move on earnings, that can be difficult to get right if anything unexpected happens. On the flipside, if the stock barely moves on earnings the market probably won't help move it much in the days after.

**In the News**

This big news of last week was the direct listing of **Coinbase (COIN)** shares. The stock closed the week near $340. Options in Coinbase have not been listed yet but that could happen by the end of this week.

Bitcoin itself saw some volatility over the weekend with a bit of a Flash Crash from 65k to 55k. **BTC** options are pricing about a **7%** move for the upcoming week.

**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**

Earnings season heats up even more this week. Low levels of market volatility affect options pricing in individual stocks, and there is always the possibility of idiosyncratic moves (on earnings misses or beats) that will be difficult for options to isolate ahead of time. Translation: Options need to price the fact that stocks aren't moving around much day to day, then they need to price the possibility of a big move on earnings, that can be difficult to get right if anything unexpected happens. On the flipside, if the stock barely moves on earnings the market probably won't help move it much in the days after.

**In the News**

This big news of last week was the direct listing of **Coinbase (COIN)** shares. The stock closed the week near $340. Options in Coinbase have not been listed yet but that could happen by the end of this week.

Bitcoin itself saw some volatility over the weekend with a bit of a Flash Crash from 65k to 55k. **BTC** options are pricing about a **7%** move for the upcoming week.

**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**

The lower levels of implied volatility in the broader market coincide with earnings season. This week sees reports from **IBM, Netflix, Snap, Intel, Chipotle** and more.

The expected move is not a prediction of exactly how a stock will react, but an actionable signal of how options traders are pricing the moves with ramifications for your own trade set-ups (risk, strike selection, etc) As always let me know in the comments if there are any obvious/interesting stocks I missed.

**The Markets**

**Last Week ‚Äì** The **SPY** closed Friday at new highs, up about **1.6%** on the week. Once again, that move was beyond what options were pricing (1.1%). The outsized move higher was not enough to affect implied volatility. The **VIX** was down slightly on the week, closing near 16.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$413** as a *bearish consensus* and **$421** as a *bullish consensus.*

**Expected Moves for This Week (April 19th):**

* SPY 1%
* QQQ 1.5%
* IWM 1.9%

I developed a few tools last month and I have been testing their results by posting alerts in different groups. The tool here uses data analysis on top of options flow to make short term predictions (1-5) days about stocks. This can be really useful for day traders, hence this post here. There is no promotion, so don't worry. 

We've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$NFLX**  \- Bullish probability of 86.99%. This seems a really great setup for a  good bullish run. Recently touched the moving averages and staying above  them now ([https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png](https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png)). Expecting this to go up.

**$COST** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This might do a small pull back first. Get in on that ([https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png)). Getting in right away wouldn't be a great setup.

**$AAPL**  \- Bullish probability of 72.78%. Bullish triangle formed on 1 hour  chart. Careful with this setup if it drops because there is a gap.  Otherwise, this might run more upwards ([https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png](https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png)).

**$FSLY**  \- Bullish probability of 70.68%. I know this dropped hard today but  this stock respects the moving averages a lot. Get in on a dip,  preferably on the $102 level ([https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png](https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png))

# Bearish Alerts

**$FCX** \- Bearish probability of 91.97%. This is only a good setup if it falls down and crosses the support level at $13.6 ([https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png](https://i.imgur.com/Pxdbdt9.png))

**$XOM** \- Bearish probability of 91.96%. This seems like a good setup, especially if it can stay below the $44.3 level ([https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png](https://i.imgur.com/O7RXKX7.png))

**$AAL** \- Bearish probability of 91.67%. **Very very risky setup**.  After the news today, I would be careful. However, airlines have a  habit of going down after rallying for a day. The $13 level is very  important resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png](https://i.imgur.com/d6XP1Bp.png))

**$WLL** \- Bearish probability of 91.10%. Good setup if it breaks the $1.05 resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png](https://i.imgur.com/jQXw9uw.png)

i4ixug_NFLX,NFLX,"My AI Options Tool Watchlist | AAL, AAPL, NFLX, FSLY, WLL","Hey folks - long term lurker here. I developed a few tools last month and I have been testing their results by posting alerts in different groups. The tool here uses data analysis on top of options flow to make short term predictions (1-5) days about stocks. This can be really useful for day traders, hence this post here. There is no promotion, so don't worry. 

We've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.

The tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.

Bullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.

# Bullish Alerts

**$NFLX**  \- Bullish probability of 86.99%. This seems a really great setup for a  good bullish run. Recently touched the moving averages and staying above  them now ([https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png](https://i.imgur.com/92oNdFy.png)). Expecting this to go up.

**$COST** \- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This might do a small pull back first. Get in on that ([https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/qYLkVim.png)). Getting in right away wouldn't be a great setup.

**$AAPL**  \- Bullish probability of 72.78%. Bullish triangle formed on 1 hour  chart. Careful with this setup if it drops because there is a gap.  Otherwise, this might run more upwards ([https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png](https://i.imgur.com/L4SB1ky.png)).

**$FSLY**  \- Bullish probability of 70.68%. I know this dropped hard today but  this stock respects the moving averages a lot. Get in on a dip,  preferably on the $102 level ([https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png](https://i.imgur.com/g0WnfMa.png))

hsz7od_NFLX,NFLX,$NFLX - some of Wall Street's thoughts post Q2 miss,"Mostly Bullish:

* Morgan Stanley - ""  Beyond the outperformance in the quarter, we highlight three positive trends heading into 2H20 and beyond.First, churn continues to be down YoY and is below pre-COVID (early2020) levels even as many geographies have re-opened. This suggests that the extent of the demand ""pull forward""effect is modest. Second,engagement trends have come off peak levels but remain above pre-COVID levels, suggesting that Netflix could consider price adjustments earlier than we are forecasting. Engagement is one of the signals we believe the company considers when implementing rate increases. Given a largely fixed cost business, price increases drive high incremental margins and earnings upside.Finally, with the majority of Netflix's production occurring outside the US combined with massive efforts to re-imagine production in a post COVID world and selectively acquiring third party content,2021 original deliveries should be higher than 2020 for the year and in each individual quarter. While Netflix faces a challenging 1H21 compare, the year should bring an even stronger content offering than 2020"" 
* RBC - "" In our 6/8 Updating The Long Thesis report, we highlighted how our International surveys have consistently indicated higher Sat Scores than in the U.S. and detailed all the LLO success Netflix was generating. Our conclusion was that NFLX may be able to achieve global (ex-CCP) broadband household penetration similar to what it has achieved in North America (57% & rising). On roughly 800MM bband HHs, that‚Äôs approaching 500MM subs. And that could translate into $50 in EPS‚Ä¶ which could translate into $1,000+ in price (20X+P/E) in the long-term. At the margin, we are more confident in this outlook, even if the Q3 Subs guide looks soft. We see conservatism consistent with Q2 outlook. Key theme from the EPS call was International. And it‚Äôs a bonus to hear that Reed is ‚Äúin it for a decade.‚Äù We sense the company is looking to flex its pricing power (a + catalyst), and we see the new FCF power of NFLX (15% Q2 FCF margin) attracting a broader range of investors. Reit Outperform.""
* Goldman Sachs - "" While we expected even more significant upside to consensus estimates given the strength in downloads and declining churn, looking beyond the current crisis we continue to believe that Netflix‚Äôs massive content investments (Exhibit 3), global distribution ecosystem and improving competitive position will further drive financial results significantly above consensus expectations. We remain Buy rated (on CL) though we lower our 12-month price target to $600 from $670 to reflect our revised estimates.""
* BMO - ""Once again, next quarter‚Äôs guidance disappointed, and once again, we recommend buying the weakness as: 1) the 3Q guide comes in the face of a historically strong 1H20 sub additions; 2) we expect price increases to pick up in 2H20; and 3) guidance for flat to positive FCF in 2020 gives us increased confidence in a consistent turn beginning in 2022. We continue to believe the latter point will attract more focus over the next 12 months as underappreciated content cost leverage becomes better understood. ""
* Jefferies - "" While the soft 3Q outlook may put the stock in the penalty box near-term, there is no change to our positive LT thesis. We view NFLX as a consistent high double-digit growth story with sizable margin expansion over time. We expressed caution heading into the print given the swift stock move and elevated multiple, but we would use any persistent near-term weakness as an opportunity to accumulate shares. PT to $550, implies 42x EBITDA (vs a 37% 3 yr forward CAGR)""
* Canaccord Genuity - "" Netflix continued to benefit from increased consumption of SVOD content during Q2, with the \~26M net adds from 1H20 coming close to the total subscribers the company added in all of 2019 (\~28M). Engagement across all cohorts remained strong on the heels of a steady stream of popular original TV and film titles across a variety of genres, ranging from teen dramas to reality dating series and children‚Äôs films. The company also announced several management changes, including Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos also becoming co-CEO with Reed Hastings, who reiterated his continuity as a CEO, and Greg Peters taking on the COO role in addition to his current role as a Chief Product Officer. While lighter-than-expected Q3 guidance implies that there may have been a pull forward of demand over recent months, management reiterated that its 2H20 and FY21 content slate remains largely intact despite the impact of COVID-19 on production globally, which should support further subscriber growth over time. Netflix's content library investment allowed the company to evolve from a platform to watch re-runs to a quality source of original content, and now a destination for some of the biggest movie premieres, which makes the service an essential part of any consumer entertainment bundle. ""
* Pivotal - "" While the materially better than expected subscriber results were driven by the global stay-at-home orders related to the unfortunate COVID-19 virus our view remains that COVID-19 is simply accelerating trends already in place away from traditional PayTV to DTC \[with 2Q clearly going to be the worst PayTV result in history in the U.S.\] and cementing NFLX‚Äôs position as the dominant global DTC operator for the foreseeable future. Subscriber growth is the flywheel that drives a virtuous cycle for NFLX as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can invest in original content which increases the target market for their service (and reduces existing subscriber churn) + enhances their ability to take future price increases and dramatically increases barriers to entry, boosted by continued material increases in broadband availability/speeds globally and the fact that on most of earth net neutrality regulations allow NFLX to piggy back for nearly free on the substantial investment to increase broadband speeds made by telecom companies. Post these results we net net tweaked our 2020 full year subscriber forecasts moderately lower which was more than offset by the nicely better than expected expense trends (even adjusting for the effects of Covid-19) which led to a modest $20 increase in our YE‚Äô20 target to $600 (based on DCF 23X ‚Äô25 terminal EBITDA and an 8% d. rate)."" 

Bearish:

* Credit Suisse - ""  We are downgrading Netflix from an Outperform to a Neutral due to a lack of near term catalysts. Serious investor concerns regarding the ‚Äú3 C‚Äôs‚Äù (competition; content quality; cost of content) have waned, appropriately so in our view, while Netflix has benefitted from a particularly strong content slate and the COVID crisis has been a significant accelerant for the shift to streaming globally. Looking forward, we see: (1) subdued subscriber growth in 2H20 due to the stay-at-home pull forward into 1H20 (26m 1H net adds vs. 12m last year), and unlike the similar 1Q20 pull-forward concerns, there is evidence sub growth has already slowed based on the weekly subscriber chart in management‚Äôs 2Q letter; (2) obviously difficult 1H21 comparisons, exacerbated by mgmt. indicating top hits in the 2021 content slate will be 2H-weighted, competing content will have re-ramped (sports, theatrical releases, fresh linear content), and we expect price increases to kick in late 2020 to mid-2021 (the last was early/mid 2019), likely further hampering net adds (mgmt. is targeting revenue growth, but investors are targeting subscriber growth); and (3) investor interest in Netflix as a stay-at-home ‚Äúwinner‚Äù might taper off with countries reopening. Our long-term view of Netflix as the clear global subscription streaming leader is unchanged, but to shift the valuation paradigm from these levels would require, in our view, investors: (1) adding mobile to TAM; (2) assuming Netflix will be able to bundle and sell more products with its service; or (3) anticipating robust FCF and its deployment.""
* Needham - ""Caution Advised. Trouble Ahead? Analysis: 1) Live sports was dark, cinemas, theaters, music festivals, theme parks, cruises etc (ie, competitors for time) were closed for all of 2Q20, NFLX was the only company consistently airing new content throughout the quarter, and billions of potential subs were sheltering at home owing to health or government official directives. How does it get any better for NFLX? 2) We agree with NFLX that some sub adds were pulled forward from future periods. We believe NFLX valuations have downside risk if/when NFLX adds return to a more normalized trend line. 3) To justify NFLX's current valuation based on FCF, we calculate that NFLX must triple revenue to $70B and paid subs must reach 500mm paying an avg of $11/month, based on 2Q20's FCF/ revs ratio of 15%. RISKY BUSINESS NFLX characterizes part of their current sub growth during COVID-19 as pulling forward sub adds. We agree. By implication, consumer demand isn't getting larger, so future sub additions will fall to or below the trend line of prior years as the perfect storm of 2Q20 benefits to NFLX ends (ie, live sports return, production resumes, lock downs lift, etc). At valuation multiples of 10x revenue and a PE of 60x, can NFLX rise during the correction back to its more normal trend line? We note that global sub adds have flattened since May 1.""

Sort of on the fence:

* Oppenheimer - "" Raising target to $515 from $480 and maintaining our Outperform rating, as we believe the current environment continues to favor NFLX's global production capabilities and extensive content library vs. competitors. 2Q results pointed to a further sub pullforward from COVID-19, with 1H:20 net adds of 26M nearly eclipsing FY19 net adds of 28M. However, new subs typically churn at a higher rate than legacy subs and the global reopening likely causes slower gross adds. 3Q adds guided 59% below top quartile of Street estimates, suggesting recent bulls got ahead of themselves. Global production of originals in most markets resumed. Mgmt. conservatively maintaining FY margin guidance, even though YTD tracking ahead, with likely upside to FY21E, based on comments of potential '21 international price hikes.""
* Piper Sandler - "" Netflix sub net adds for Q2'20 beat consensus, driven by ""stay-at-home"" policies amid Covid. Guidance for Q3'20 sub net adds is below expectations, but Covid will likely impact results. Netflix also announced Ted Sarandos as Co-CEO and board member. For Q2'20, Global net adds were 10.1M vs. Street at 8.3M. Q2'20 EPS was $1.59, below consensus of $1.82 while Rev was $6.15B vs Street at $6.09B. Sub growth did not translate to stronger EPS, due in part to FX headwinds ($289M impact) offsetting savings on marketing and content expenses that drove op margin to 22% (street at 18%). Sub outlook for Q3'20 is 2.5M globally, below the Street at 5.4M. We reiterate our OW rating and raise our PT to $534 from $500 PT on an increased \~60x (from \~57x) '21 EPS. """,2020-07-17,144,38

hsa0qf_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX Earnings Trade?,"Hi, I'm posting a few thoughts on earnings that are intended to be helpful in trying to gain consistency in trading.

With NFLX earnings today after the close, I'm seeing a lot of newer traders discussing buying far out of the money calls in the hopes that NFLX ""kills it"" and rallies huge after earnings.  As a word of warning, although this ""could"" work, it is one of the lowest probability trades you can do.

The market makers (and computers) have already priced in a $43 move either up or down in the stock.  So in order to make decent money in a long call or long put, the stock would need to move much more than the $43 move that is already priced in.  In other words, you could buy a $600 call, the stock jumps up $43 with earnings, and you lose 100% of your money invested in the trade (assuming you bought a $600 call that expires Friday).  In addition to the move being ""baked in"" the Implied Volatility is at peak levels right before earnings.  Friday morning that Implied Volatility will instantly drop back to normal, and the premium portion of the options will implode.  All in all, it makes buying an out of the money call a lotto ticket trade.

[The \\""market maker move\\"" is shown on this platform, but you can also get close to that figure buy adding up the at the money call and at the money put. ](https://preview.redd.it/cb1i9hx028b51.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4f351c719e9ff45671cbcf7d6ab0e535612b16)

Instead, consider what the market makers do for earnings.  They sell the at the money call and the at the money put as a naked straddle in order to capture the rapid premium decay after earnings are announced.  They make a living doing this.

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of naked options over earnings, so instead, I'll do an at the money Iron Condor (also called an Iron Fly when the sold strikes are the same).  This is selling a naked straddle but with the protection of long options to contain your maximum risk in case the stock does have one of those rare moves that is well beyond what is already ""expected.""

This is what the risk to reward looks like on a 1 lot trade on a $45 wide (expected move) Iron Fly on NFLX.  (To reduce your max risk, you can narrow the width of the spread).

[Max profit and max loss selling the $525 at the money call and put and buying options $45 out on either side to establish maximum risk.](https://preview.redd.it/6qyz6wg838b51.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a74d1cbf750af6d80ab2aaa551e476e5f980ed)

This is simply a bet that the move on NFLX is already baked into the options price, and by the time the stock opens Friday morning, it will be up or down less than the $43 expected move.

A few notes on this trade:

* It's not guaranteed to work, of course, but the odds of getting a profit on this setup is much higher, over time, than buying an out of the money call.  (And don't get me wrong, it is amazing having calls when a stock explodes - this strategy is more for consistent base hits than occasional grand slam home runs).
* Tip: If you normally risk $1,500 on a trade on a normal stop loss, then just line up your ""max loss"" with this.  That way if the trade hits max loss, it is just like hitting a stop out vs. trading too big and having a max loss trade be a disaster.
* The closer NFLX opens to your sold strikes Friday morning, or anytime on Friday, the higher your profit.
* If NFLX does open up or down right around the expected move, you can wait for retracements.  (The expected move often acts as support or resistance, as there is a lot of money riding on it staying within that range).
* Max loss occurs if, by Friday's close, NFLX is trading above the long options, in this case, $570 or $480.  I always position size assuming it is NOT going to work, so I'm not freaking out if it has a big move against me.  Base hits, not home runs.
* In general, I try to get out at 50% of the credit received.  In this case, the credit is $32.25, so my exit would be set near $16.00.  I've found that to be a fairly consistent level to exit if the stock is staying within the ""expected move"" parameters.

Hope it helps!

Edit:  Adding a screenshot of trade after the close.  Currently, NFLX is trading down around $475, so it's kicking me in the teeth.  I would need the stock to rally back to $500 at some point tomorrow in order to get a scratch/small gain on the fly.  If it opens up down within the expected move, then I might sell some 450 put credit spreads to bring in additional credit to offset the loss.  If it opens below the expected move, I might buy back the short put and let the long put run but that brings on a lot of additional risk.  Should be an interesting Friday.

[NFLX Earnings Trade](https://preview.redd.it/7bmg3kps9ab51.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=1658a25e46ee264ea96f09cf0c746d19d49bfcbb)

Edit: Ok now it's Friday after the close.  Did NFLX follow those ""expected move"" guidelines or not?  Here's a chart that includes the after-hours action.  After hours will usually push through the expected move, as it did after earnings.  Then, with the cash open it was back to ""at"" and eventually ""within"" the expected move of $43.  The move up to $500 allowed me to get out of the iron fly at a small gain (if you don't open near the closing price, the goal is to get out on a move inside of the expected move once the after-hours action has settled down).  Ideally, we open up or move closer to the previous days closing price, as that would give us the biggest bang for the buck on the trade.

Anyway, hope it's helpful in understanding earnings moves.  My preference is to sell options to take advantage of premium decay and the tendency of a stock to stay within its expected move vs. buying OTM calls and puts hoping for a move that is greater than what's already been priced in.

hs4anm_NFLX,NFLX,Finding NFLX Iron Condor,"I have a hypothesis that the Netflix earnings report will either do very well or very bad based on its recent coronavirus high implied volatility, trading volume, and hype. If the earnings aren't as good as expected (or bad), I think it will drop drastically, and if the earnings report is amazing, it will get jacked up exceptionally.

I want to buy a long iron condor position tomorrow, but to be honest it's my first time trading an iron condor and I've just spent 3 hours on a typical iron condor expiration P/L graph and [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) looking for a good trade, but everything I try just turns out looking like a terrible deal (on the calculator). No matter how much I bring the contract strike prices closer to the share price, I'm still seeing that the stock will need over 15-20% change in either direction for a minuscule, almost negligible change in the position value. I'm literally doing an OTM call debit spread and an OTM put debit spread, with the long legs of each spread being very close to the share price in order to minimize the range that the position will lose on.

g60q5x_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX advice for today. Didn't YOLO. No suicide watch.,"Good morning. 

I'm a bullish investor, and my strategy is buy stock I like, buy calls, buy protective puts. For example, stock XYZ is down 5% today. I think XYZ is a kickass company, so I buy $1000 of stock XYZ and $100 of 30-45 DTE 10-20% OTM call. Second green day after that, when I think it won't go up more in the next few days, I buy $100 of 30-45 DTE 10-20% OTM put. I sell those calls on a green day about two weeks before expiry. I sell those puts on a down day about two weeks before expiry. 

Edit: need to point out that I already own shares in most equities I trade. I never fully exit unless it's shat the bed, and re-entering those have been a bad experience for me. The situation I mentioned is for purchase of **additional** shares.

That leads us to NFLX. I currently have shares, 5/15 500c bought at $8, 5/15 600c at $1.5, but NFLX has been on such a tear that I haven't had the chance to buy a 5/15 put. I ended up having to settle for a 4/24 310p $0.21 for protection against a potentially disappointing ER. 

I know I should have sold those calls on Thursday, but I forgot to set an auto profit exit and wavered when I saw it shooting up. We're down 2% in pre. Should I sell the put today, then wait a few days to sell the calls? I am still bullish on the underlying, even at this price.

Furthermore, is this a reasonable strategy, and do you guys think tomorrow afternoon will be a good time frame to buy 6/19 puts? I'm trying to keep all of my strangles a month or more out. Planning to sell all of the 5/15 stuff soon and buying 6/19 ones in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks in advance everyone. Happy Oil-is-gapping-up Day.

**Update**: sold all of the NFLX calls at open today. Definitely learned about IV crush in a real way. Luckily, even though I lost about 40% on the calls, it only translated to 2% of my portfolio. Thanks for the info everyone!",2020-04-22,0,8

NFLX revenues for the quarter were $5.77 billion, in line with the Wall Street analyst consensus at $5.76 billion, while profits were $1.57 a share, a little below the Street at $1.65.

\- According to Apptopia, there was a clear surge in monthly active users into March, particularly for countries that saw early impacts (i.e. Italy, Japan, South Korea).

\- Akamai also noted a 30% y/y increase in global traffic over the past four weeks driven by video streaming.

\- Disney+ tracking ahead of plan reaching 50m subs is arguably also an indicator that streaming saw a surge in the quarter, which NFLX is expected to fully participate in.

For NFLX to move higher from here, the Street's focus will likely be whether the 1H outlook implies a y/y acceleration in global paid subscriber additions.

fgghhk_NFLX,NFLX,Why Coronavirus could be bad for NFLX,"With more people staying home due to the coronavirus outbreak, you'd think that NFLX should see some benefit from the increased usage. This may not be the case unfortunately. In the US, NFLX charges a fixed price monthly subscription regardless of the number of hours of usage. Since this is not an ad-driven model, there is no revenue upside to the increase in viewing hours unless it translates to more subscribers.

Internationally, NFLX is considered a luxury service at a time when the overall economy is beginning to reflect the impact of travel restrictions and employment is increasingly at risk (particularly across the service industry). Tourism is 10% of GDP in France, 13% in Italy, and 15% in Spain. This means NFLX subscriber losses in these markets may rise.

Finally, NFLX's BB- junk bond credit rating and negative free cash flow mean the company needs access to capital at a time of growing market uncertainty, which could see higher cost of capital.",2020-03-10,0,2

f3ewrs_NFLX,NFLX,Some concerning indicators for $NFLX out of Nielsen's latest report,"Nielsen's (very expensive) ""Streaming Wars"" report published this week highlights some hard-to-ignore risks facing Netflix:

1) **27% of US households surveyed said they will consider substituting one SVOD for another**, which implies \~16m NFLX subs are at risk of cancelling to join a new entrant.

2) **62% of US households pay for 2+ SVOD services, but only 10% take 4+**, which means homes are more likely to substitute an existing service than adding a new service.

3) **84% of households surveyed said cost is the most important factor in their decision**, so NFLX is likely to lose subs being priced at $9-16/month or 30-100% higher than Disney+, Apple TV+, CBS All Access, Peacock.

4) **AVOD continues to take share from SVOD**.

5) With **unique program titles up 10% y/y to 646k at the end of 2019**, quality content seems to be ubiquitous and increasingly commoditized. This indicates that customer acquisition cost is rising, and differentiation is increasingly driven by marketing spend rather than content.

**$ROKU** may be a better play as it appears to be the winning aggregator of SVOD and AVOD streaming services in the US.

cnb5wj_NFLX,NFLX,Is there any direction for NFLX to go but down in the coming years?,"INTENSE competition arising in the next 1-2 years. WarnerMedia, NBC and Disney all launching their own respective streaming services. NFLX missing MASSIVELY on subscriber growth last quarter after two great quarters mainly driven by price increases. 

With more and more streaming services coming out, the pickings get slimmer on Netflix and they have to rely on their own content, which continues to burn hundreds of millions for them in production costs, and the reality is that most of the shows that Netflix claims to be their drivers (Orange is the New Black, The Crown) are forgettable to anyone except people who began watching them years ago, and ultimately when they end, the incentive to stay with the service after already having watched the shows will decrease. 

Netflix likely won‚Äôt be able to increase prices anymore (which was a main driver of their huge revenue these last two quarters) without it hitting their subscriber base dramatically as the new Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle at $12.99 is debuting at the SAME PRICE as the current most popular Netflix deal. As Netflix loses more and more content, pricing models become exponentially more competitive and streaming service options quadruple, is there any way for Netflix to go but down?

IMO, NFLX will continue to tank into the low 200s. It might dead cat bounce here and there but the trend going in 2019 and 2020 is down. 

Facts and Opinions

-	It‚Äôs US subscription base is saturated. It‚Äôs the most stable, profitable. To increase revenue in the US, Netflix has to increase monthly price. This will be a further hit on new subs and current subs. 

-	Foreign markets continue to see higher percentage growth. No necessarily a great thing. There‚Äôs huge marketing and support costs in trying to penetrate these new territories. This is cash burn hell. 

-	Even with the 11% haircut. PE is at 125. CEO keeps saying it‚Äôs a media company not a tech company. Well, Hasting, DIS PE is 15. Please explain why your media company is 8 times more expansive then the best media company in the world that, by the way, will own HULU outright and will launch Disney+. NFLX fair value as a media company is 40-50 dollars. Let‚Äôs add a 4x multiple for its ‚Äúgrowth story‚Äù.  Then it‚Äôs 200 per share. Not 300+

-	It‚Äôs business model just does not work. Debt to equity ratio is 1.8. They have a burn rate of 3.5B in 2019 and more of the same in 2020. And for what? It‚Äôs mostly spent on content. Besides OITNB, HOC, and Stranger Things, it has not generated many franchises. Disney creates the best content franchises of anyone and it still cannot guarantee a hit. Content is not scalable or predictable. NFLX BURN RATE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE NOT DECREASE. Once Friends and the Office leave, they need their own mega-hits. No guarantees there. 

-	Streaming was innovative and convenient 10 years ago. It‚Äôs taken for granted now. NFLX has no most. No tech advantage.

With every other television provider getting into streaming, programs that people love will continue to drop off and eventually Netflix will be composed of weird foreign shows and their own sporadically good original content. People will gravitate towards streaming services that apply to their tastes like HBO shows, Disney shows and eventually everyones brother, mother, father will stop subscribing in lieu for their own streaming taste prefecences and no one will be there to take on their own subscription of Netflix. Once this occurs Netflix's subscriber numbers will drop off like flies. Essentially this argument would apply to all streaming services but since this effects Netflix's entire business model I am going to to focus on it almost entirely.

Optimistically, there will be a company in the future that works to bundle these numerous streaming services into one package and that will take the place of the new cool streaming company that Netflix once was, that is unless Netflix reads the writing on the wall and does exactly that.",2019-07-18,18,50

## 

Netflix Inc. **(NFLX)** is scheduled to release earnings on October 16, 2018, after the market closes, and will hold a conference call at 6:00 PM ET on the same day. The stock currently trades at 335.25, which is **11.7% lower** than the close following its last reported earnings, trading with a range of 310.93 to 386.80 since that time.

### Expected Price Volatility

Currently, option traders are expecting a **¬± 9.7%** move for this earnings, and during the previous earnings release, the stock experienced a **-5.2%** move. Over the last 12 quarters, the absolute average move has been **¬± 8.3%**, with a minimum move of 0.1% and a maximum move of 19.0%.

The way I see it, most people can only afford to have one streaming service, and right now NFLX is it. But once Disney emerges, they will probably be the default service. NFLX can be a strong #2, but for how long? And will they still command their high valuation?

Their advantages:

1.) small, lean, quick

2.) huge lead in tech. They have their own proprietary CDN network consisting of boxes they install at ISPs and other local points all around the world. It's leaps ahead of anyone else. Even Amazon hasn't caught up... yet.

3.) Content acquisition has been on point. They've faltered a bit of late, but not to bad. This is going to be a problem as a lot of their high profile content has come from Disney.",2018-09-21,2,7

1) The main strengths of DIS streaming services, live sports and cartoons for kids, are both valid core offerings. However both are niche compared to the varied tastes of the average consumer who just wants lots of varied content.

2) I believe hardcore live sport stream services already exist or will soon exist to satisfy that segment of the market

3) Serving up 100M viewers at once as NFLX does it a big technological achievement done entirely through AWS. I assume DIS will try to have a similar microservices cloud based architecture. However pulling this off successfully is a monumental task that requires software engineering expertise. NFLX has this and DIS does not.

My feeling is this space will be heating up in 2019, and Netflix may potentially lose their competitive advantage. Just my intuition. 

1) Should I wait till next earnings in July to sell?
2) Should I just pull the trigger now?
3) Once I cash out, what‚Äôs a safer, more diversified investment option to buy for long term growth (20 year)? Low fee, any solid recommendations?

UPDATE: I sold all shares today at $398. Look...I saw the estimates that it has a $500 Target. I get that. But the biggest mistake I ALWAYS make, is I never know when to sell. I pulled out almost 14K in a 3K investment. Now I can take that 14K, and our it into something more diversified so it can grow over many years. If I just stick with Netflix, it might hit $500, or $1000...but eventually if it becomes overheated it could stall or come down. I think long term that 14K has an equal or better chance of doubling or tripling in something safer, more diversified. 

So I‚Äôm out of Netflix. I cashed out a 300% profit...There is NOTHING bad about that. Missed opportunity costs and greed are pretty close to synonyms.

UPDATE 2: I think I‚Äôm going to put the 14K in QQQ. It allows me to stay in tech, but diversify amongst the big boys. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook. My only hesitation is after 9 years of growth, this market has to correct eventually. But I‚Äôm in my 30s, I plan to leave this money 20 years +. So I think this is my decision.",2018-06-19,37,115

7335w1_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX - valuation,"NFLX has a market cap of 78 billion. NFLX did 243m in net income last year. NFLX trades at a billion times earnings, the valuation on this company is ridiculous. I love Netflix, it's a great product. No way in hell is the company worth 78b. NFLX did 8.83b in revenue last year with a sub count of 94m. So everyone of those 94m subs contributes about $94 to revenue. Todd Juenger is a super bullish analyst from Bernstein who says subs could hit 300m in 2030. Even if this is true, 300m subs = 28-29b in revenue. Let's be nice to NFLX and assume they can squeeze a little more money out of their sub base and let's push the revenue contribution per sub number from $94 each to $110 each puts us at revenue around 33b. Net Income/Sales for NFLX is 4%ish, NFLX will get better at controlling costs as it matures as a business, I don't doubt this at all so let's say in 13 years the company manages to get to NI/Sales of around 12%. 33b in revenue, NI/Sales of 12% = 3.96b in net income. Market cap today is 78b, and NFLX ""might"" be able to hit 4b in NI in 13 years. So if the stock doesn't go up 1 penny from now until 2030 it'll be trading at a P/E of 19. Which is a pretty reasonable P/E ratio for a mature company, but the stock has to do nothing for the next 13 years to get there. This company needs to hit a NI/Sales of 40% one day to justify it's valuation. The only way you can buy this stock is if you think NFLX can triple it's subscriber base while keeping costs completely flat for the next 13 years. That doesn't seem likely.

Also just for fun, assuming the stock averages 8% annualized over the next 13 years that puts it at a market cap of over 200b. 50x earnings makes no sense for a mature company, which is what NFLX will be in 13 years.

4w6hph_NFLX,NFLX,stockAday: Netflix' a fuzzy pix? ($NFLX),"# Key Stats for Netflix, Inc.

I fear that writing about $NFLX equals clickbait. ;) But like Tesla it's one of those amazing products that I find tough to justify from a valuation perspective. 

But maybe, just maybe 2016 is the year the business goes to the moon? Or as an investment banker might say, maybe 2016 is the year Netflix grows into its valuation ;).

# Description
Netflix is an Internet based entertainment / television network. The Company's members can watch original series, documentaries and feature films online. Revenues come from monthly membership fees for services consisting of streaming content. 

Though with over 80 million subscribers...we all know what they folks do!


## Recent financials 

So sure there is growth and the profit line scrapes along, but the thing that catches my eye is the *delta* in the top line. The business added $1.3bn of sales in 2015 on top of adding $1.1bn in 2004. i.e. the machine is accelerating. 

The current forecast is for sales of $8.7bn in 2016, i.e up $1.9bn. And for 2017 the forecast is $10.7bn, up $2.0bn. So Wall Street thinks the acceleration is here to stay. And if any of the other tech players' history is repeated, acceleration usually implies dominance, market power and cash flow. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.8bn | $5.5bn | $4.4bn | $3.6bn | $3.2bn|
|EPS | $0.28 | $0.62 | $0.26 | $0.04 | $0.59|

## Competition

Talking competition in their filings:

> The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. 

So that means the cable players, the content players, even the big internet players. 

Unsurprisingly, given it's business doesn't have ""legacy"" infrastructure it's margins are high. Clearly margins are more like the internet giants than the media giants. Fortunately!

Though returns aren't great, probably given they are in investment mode. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Netflix, Inc. | $7,625M | 58% | 6%
Comcast Corporation | $75,973M | 33% | 15%
Walt Disney Co | $54,826M | 30% | 20%
Liberty Global PLC | $17,118M | 46% | -ve
DISH Network Corp | $15,137M | 17% | 28%
CBS Corporation | $14,303M | 23% | 28%
SKY PLC (ADR) | $15,945M | 18% | 20%
Time Warner Inc | $27,903M | 27% | 17%

Facebook Inc | $22,160M | 49% | 13%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $120,637M | 9% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Netflix, Inc. has $539M of net debt. That is 1x its latest operating profit. So no real concerns here. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $105 for Netflix, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 13% to their target. So it's hard to get excited, and worse, in the last 3 months the brokers price target has come down from $120, though the stock's not budged.

# Valuation

And here's where a *value* guy like me usually gives up: 300x earnings. But should I give up? 

I need an envelope:

* Say I'm willing to invest if I can double my money in 5 years. It'll be worth $80bn. 
* Pay 20x earnings in 5 years, and it would need to be generating $4bn of net profit. 
* At a 20% margin that would be $20bn of sales. Up from $8.5bn today. And implies an annual 15-20% topline growth. 
* Doable, yes if the business is now accelerating, but it would likely be a rocky ride!

# Dividends
Netflix, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Nor would I want one! Grow baby, grow!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4% with sales up 26% in the last 6 months. 

Catalysts for $NFLX seem to be pretty obvious... it's all the KPIs, subscribers, churn, revenue per sub and maybe a look at margins. The occasional hit or miss with the original programming will move it too. 

But none of it matters :) Either the business is accelerating or it's not. Agree?

Yes, the company has produced some better original content, but people have already checked out of House of Cards and OITNB and the viewership data just isn't there. 

With the stock now below $100, does this mean Netflix is a buy? Or is the market right to be doubting the company's generous earnings multiple when it has tons of competition on its heels bidding for content?

1va94g_NFLX,NFLX,NFLX Tumbles Like A House Of Cards,"Leading streaming movies and TV content provider Netflix Inc (NFLX) is declining sharply today. It seems the stock is falling after a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's Open Internet Order which had prevented Internet Service Providers from charging Internet content providers fees. The stock was immediately downgraded by Wedbush. Short term day traders can watch the $305.15 level for intra-day support. This is just a day trading level and not a long term support area.

1ifn1t_NFLX,NFLX,Why Should I NOT Short NFLX?,"So amidst today's huge TSLA loss I started thinking about other companies that seem to keep rising despite relatively poor fundamentals (in a traditional sense). The biggest one to come to mind is Netflix. Don't get me wrong--I love the product--but with an increase of nearly 53% since the last earnings report I feel like the company is ripe for an underwhelming July 22nd earnings report relative to the hype. It has a forward P/E of 84, it has a PEG Ratio (5 yr.) of 9.52, and the competition from Amazon has only just started to heat up. Also, I would say Netflix was 1 for 3 with original content this quarter (Orange is the New Black received good reviews and hype, Arrested Development was less than stellar, and Hemlock Grove was not liked by many from what I understand). So, can anyone give me any good reason not to short Netflix?",2013-07-16,1,20
