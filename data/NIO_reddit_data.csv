1k6yid8_NIO,NIO,$NB - NioCorp: Unlocking U.S. Critical Minerals - 20x Potential 🚀,"NioCorp Developments ($NB) controls the **only permitted niobium-scandium-titanium deposit in the United States**. The 2022 feasibility study pegs the Elk Creek project at an **after-tax NPV of US $2.35 billion** versus a sub-US $120 million market cap today - a >20× valuation gap. Financing due-diligence is underway (EXIM Bank review of up to US $800 million) and fresh drilling is upgrading reserves. If capital comes through, NB flips from optionality play to the first U.S. producer of these critical minerals.

# 1. Near-term catalysts

|Date / Stage|Why it matters|
|:-|:-|
|**Apr ’25** – 9-hole infill drilling|Converts Indicated ➜ Measured, derisking before lenders sign.|
|**Apr 29 ’25** – Company webcast|Management to outline financing timeline.|
|**EXIM Bank TRC-2 review (ongoing)**|Up to **US $800 M** low-rate debt could cover \~70 % of CAPEX.|
|**US $20.8 M equity raise (Apr ’25)**|Funds drilling + FS update without toxic converts.|

# 2. Macro tail-winds

* **Supply squeeze:** 95 % of world niobium comes from one Brazilian complex. Washington wants redundancy.
* **Demand ramp:** Niobium demand CAGR  \~10 % (2024-29) on HSLA steel, EV battery anodes, superconductors.
* **Policy muscle:** IRA, CHIPS and DoD Title III offer tax credits, loan guarantees and priority offtakes for U.S. critical-mineral projects.
* **China export controls:** Fresh REE / scandium restrictions amplify U.S. urgency for domestic supply.

# 3. Valuation math (back-of-napkin)

* After-tax NPV (US $2.35 B) / 41 M shares -> **≈ US $57 per share** vs. \~US $2.6 today.
* Haircut NPV by 60 % for financing & execution risk: fair value still >US $23 -> **\~9× upside**.

# 4. Risks to watch

1. **Financing risk** \- Elk Creek only happens if debt + offtake packages close.
2. **Dilution** \- More equity likely before final investment decision.
3. **Commodity prices** \- Niobium & scandium trade thinly; price swings can hammer cash flow.
4. **Execution** \- Underground mine + hydromet plant are complex; delays kill IRR.

# Bottom line

If you bet that Washington will bankroll a domestic critical-minerals supply chain - and you can stomach mining-sector volatility - $NB offers asymmetric upside: tiny market cap, world-class orebody, a clear (if fragile) path to funding. **I’m loading while the market prices Elk Creek like it’ll never be built.**",2025-04-24,4,6

1iylpsv_NIO,NIO,HIDDEN BEHEMOTH V2: NIO,"Hey guys!

Back at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short as many can’t read complete sentences.  Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.   I only post when I see a big opportunity.

The stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.  Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.     To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer. 

**Pros:**  

\-          New addressable markets with two new brands.  FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer)  

\-          ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.   \*\*They even have access to NIO’s battery swapping stations!!!\*\*  This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.   

\-          Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.   They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.  The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn’t there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-          Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.   Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-          Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-          US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-          Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-          They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi’s CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-          Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-          Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-          They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-          Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

 

Everything is coming together for this company.   While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.   They are just amazing cars, period.  Don’t look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.  They are great cars.  I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.   Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.   It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today.   I put my money where my mouth is.  No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

1ih8wcs_NIO,NIO,NioCorp Developments $NB: After Hours News on Progress with EXIM Bank is Major Development,"**NioCorp Developments Ltd. (Nasdaq:NB)** closed at $2.34. Immediately after the market close (Monday, 2/3/25), the company announced  that the U.S. Export-Import Bank (**""**EXIM"") is advancing NioCorp's application for prospective EXIM project financing of its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in southeast Nebraska to an **independent Technical Review, part of EXIM's second level of project due diligence.** In April 2024, EXIM provided NioCorp with a preliminary indicative term sheet for possible financing. NioCorp has engaged JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to assist NioCorp in seeking debt financing supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S.  to advance NioCorp's proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project. This development has been long awaited by investors. With the new Administration focused on developing domestic strategic materials, the development of NB's mineral deposit concession is a high priority (assuming a successful technical review).  

* **NB 52 Week Range $1.27 - $4.00**
* **Market Capitalization: $105.5 Million** 

**Corporate Description:** NB engages in the exploration and development of mineral deposits in North America. It owns and develops the Elk Creek niobium/scandium/titanium project that owns one 226.43-acre parcel of land and associated mineral rights, and an additional 40 acres of mineral rights, as well as an optioned land package that covers an area of 1,396 acres located in Johnson County, southeast Nebraska.  

NioCorp is developing a critical minerals project in Southeast Nebraska (**the ""Elk Creek Project"") that is expected to produce niobium, scandium, and titanium**. The Company also is evaluating the potential to produce several rare earths from the Elk Creek Project. Niobium is used to produce specialty alloys as well as High Strength, Low Alloy steel, which is a lighter, stronger steel used in automotive, structural, and pipeline applications. Scandium is a specialty metal that can be combined with Aluminum to make alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance. Scandium is also a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells. Titanium is used in various lightweight alloys and is a key component of pigments used in paper, paint and plastics and is also used for aerospace applications, armor, and medical implants. Magnetic rare earths, such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium are critical to the making of Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets, which are used across a wide variety of defense and civilian applications.

**The average price target for NB between two Wall Street analysts is $3.63** with a high forecast of $4.00 and a low forecast of $3.25. The average price target represents a 55.13% change from the last price of $2.34.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NB/forecast/ But with this recent development, it is most probable that these research reports will be updated to include higher price targets.

1ia0vxm_MRNA,MRNA,Moderna (MRNA) opinion,"Hi everyone,  
I’d like to share my analysis of Moderna (MRNA) and get your thoughts on whether it might be undervalued in the current market. Despite trading at stock price levels similar to the pre-COVID era, Moderna’s financial and technological situation has transformed dramatically over the past five years.

**Key Points of Analysis**

1. **Market Value vs. Financial Growth**
   * **Assets and Equity**: The company’s assets and equity have grown approximately tenfold, driven by profits accumulated during the pandemic.
   * **Cash Reserves**: Moderna’s cash has grown significantly, from \~$1 billion pre-pandemic to \~$9 billion today.
   * **Enterprise Value (EV)**: Adjusted for debt (which has not grown substantially), the current EV is far lower compared to early 2020.
2. **Technological Advancements and Brand Growth**
   * Moderna has developed and commercialized revolutionary mRNA technology, initially used for the COVID vaccine but with potential applications in a wide range of medical treatments in the future.
   * Over the past five years, the company has enhanced its internal know-how, acquired new machinery, and significantly grown its brand reputation in the biotech industry.
3. **Valuation Disconnect**
   * Despite these advancements, Moderna’s stock is trading at a lower valuation (EV Basis) than it was pre-pandemic.
   * The likely reason for this discrepancy seems to be a current lack of interest in the pharmaceutical sector rather than fundamental weaknesses in the company.

**Questions for the Community**

* Do you think Moderna’s current valuation accurately reflects its financial and technological growth?
* Could this be an overlooked opportunity in the biotech space, or are there risks not immediately apparent in its financials or pipeline?

Looking forward to your insights!",2025-01-26,6,4

1hyabxu_NIO,NIO,$NIO long ,"$NIO is a chinese EV maker. It made record deliveries in 2024 of more than 200,000 cars. It is on the path to profitability in 2026 and 2025 deliveries are expected to be more than double 2024 deliveries. It trades at a P/S of less than 1. Recently, when it made record deliveries in December but the price didn't move much. In fact, the price has dipped since then. It is trading completely irrationally at this point and the market has to recognise that at some point. On the other hand, a company like Lucid trades at a P/S of around 10 when it delivered only 10,000 cars in 2024.
Side note: Rentech 47xed their holding in NIO last quarter at around current prices.

China fears are overblown at this point. Tariff fears are probably already priced in. Trump seems friendly. Musk won't antagonize the ccp because of his dependence on China. And the CCP, which prioritises self preservation over everything else won't risk more economic turmoil after everything that has happened in China lately so invading taiwan is probably off the table for now since that would only bring more economic turmoil and economic turmoil is at the end of the day what overthrows authoritarians. Also, they've been doing a lot to stimulate the markets lately and seem committed to it.

https://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255

It might sound crazy, but hear me out—here are 8 reasons why I’m YOLO-ing into NIO right now:

**Fed cutting rates** – The Fed’s already cutting, and they’re likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don’t fight the Fed*—when they cut, the market goes up.

**China stimulus** – The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index—stocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won’t be short because China’s economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn’t even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.

**Chinese economy recovery** – Like I said, this isn’t a short-term bull. It’ll probably last a year or two. China’s economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I’ve seen posts from Chinese forums—some people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.

**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** – Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you’ll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.

**NIO is even cheaper** – NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It’s been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month’s price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO’s sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.

**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** – The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it’s a piece of cake. [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models)

**NIO’s next two earnings are going to be huge** – They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.

**A turning point is coming** – If 0nvo’s sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they’ll scale production and cut costs. They’re also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about here.

The company reported a vehicle margin of 12.2 per cent in the second quarter, nearly doubling from the 6.2 per cent reported a year ago and up sequentially from the 9.2 per cent reported in the first three months of the year.

Gross margin also improved to 9.7 per cent, up from 1.0 per cent a year ago and from 4.9 per cent reported in the first quarter of the year.

Nio delivered 57,373 vehicles between April and June achieving a new quarterly record.

The company reported a loss of 5,209.3 million yuan ($716.8 million), decreasing by 14.2 per cent year over year and also sequentially by 3.4 per cent.

Stanley Yu Qu, Nio’s chief financial officer, said, “Due to ongoing cost optimizations, our vehicle gross margin increased to 12.2% in the second quarter”.

“We will continue to focus on efficient R&D and infrastructure investment, leverage the growth potential in the mass market, adopt flexible market strategies and continuously optimize our product portfolio. We are confident that these efforts will result in steady improvements in gross profit and cost efficiency in the future,” the new CFO added.

1cnicsr_NIO,NIO,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

1) China is in a deep recession now which will depress domestic demand

2) the battery-swap thing is nifty, but I imagine very expensive for NIO; if someone’s battery is old and crap, and it gets swapped for a brand-new battery in the swapping station, how are NIO compensated for now having an crap battery back from their consumer? Batteries are a big portion of the production cost of an EV…

3) tariffs are going to block Chinese EVs, including NIO, from US and EU - and maybe Japanese - markets (to protect domestic manufacturers)… this shuts out a massive market 

4) NIO is on luxury side, meaning it can’t compete with BYD for the global south/rest of the world EV market… also BYD made 3.58 CNY per share last quarter and NIO *lost* 2.81 CNY per share last quarter so BYD likely to outcompete NIO hard

5) Chinese declining demographics mean that every year the domestic market is going to be getting smaller and smaller, reducing space for a profitable future… (same deal in nearby markets across Asia, especially S. Korea, Japan, Vietnam)",2024-03-30,180,86

I started learning about it during COVID time and fairly new in terms of how it works. I made some investments that I didn't touch since, but I see my profile is doing really bad. I have been holding on to this for the past year hoping to recover but it seems like the profile is getting worse. Any suggestions would be appreciated:

$CGX - Avg price = 13.47 (-38.32%)  
$CYBN - Avg price = 2.86 (-83.22%)  
$FLT - Avg price = 0.87 (-65.65%)

$NUMI - Avg price = 0.68 (-78.04%)  
$TLRY - Avg price = 16.18 (-88.20%)

(Source: [NIO](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-2023)).

The revenues of the company consist of vehicle sales and other sales. The vehicle sales for the quarter went down by -0.2% YoY and -37.5% at RMB 9.2 billion (US$1,343.2 million). The company experienced a slowdown in electric vehicle deliveries in May and a lower average selling price as a result of a higher proportion of ET5 and 75-kilowatt standard-range battery pack deliveries, partially offset by an increase in delivery volume. The other sales for Q1FY23 were RMB1.5 billion (US$211.4 million), up by117.8% YoY. The revenue increase was due to the sales of accessories, provision of repair and maintenance services, sales of used cars and provision of power solutions, and provision of auto financing services. (Source: [NIO](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-2023)).

The Chinese electric carmaker reported total deliveries were at 31,041 vehicles, up by 20.5% from Q1 2022, but a 22.5% drop sequentially. Vehicle margin for this quarter stood at 5.1%, significantly down from 18.1% same period last year as a pricing war continues in China. (Source: [NIO](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-2023)).

For the Q2FY23 outlook, the electric automaker expects a  delivery volume in the range of 23,000 and 25,000 electric vehicles, which shows a potential decrease of 8.2% over the year-earlier volume. Nio expects revenue to be between RMB8,742 million (US$1,273 million) and RMB9,370 million (US$1,364 million) for Q2FY23 representing a decrease of approximately 15.1% to 9.0% from the same quarter of 2022.

### In the News

Amazon stocks has a new look Monday following a 20 for 1 split. Options positions from Friday will be x20 contract-wise on strikes now divided by 20. New trades going forward will be using the new strikes. There’s no general rule for how a stock and its options trade following a split. Studies have shown some differences between small and large-cap stock volatility post-split. Many stocks will see a period of increased volatility (also reflected in the option IV) following the split that takes a period of time to settle down into a new normal. However, AMZN’s split occurs in a market that has been volatile and IV that is still somewhat elevated vs historical averages. The only thing traders can look for is any increased retail interest in what are now much more reasonably priced (dollar-wise) options. This could affect things like upside skew and the potential for spreads or selling options vs stock that can benefit from skew in a way that retail was previously unable to affect due to the large dollar prices of most options in a $2000+ stock. Something to keep an eye on.

It initially looked like Alphabet would do its announced 20 for 1 split this week as well but it is now likely mid-July. Amazon shares saw a fairly decent run-up into its split. GOOGL options are pricing about an 8% move out to July 15th:

Also wouldn’t a PMCC be really good hear considering a 29 DTE call with a delta of 0.23 going for $73 per contract which means if done 24 times without any price movements in the underlying to pass this strike would add up to $1750 in premium - $435 lost in extrinsic value = a $1315 profit on $1400 which seems well worth it.

Check this out for a good summary: https://youtu.be/Hn\_W1dvQM-k

There is: NIO Power, NIO Life, NIO Service, NIO House and NOMI.

NIO opened a new charging line under the Power Up Plan today, the third this week and at least the 15th so far this year, featuring three battery swap stations, nine supercharging stations and three destination charging stations. 

After Fridays announcement that NIO put three battery swap stations into operation, bringing the total to 650, just 50 short of its goal of exceeding 700 by the end of the year. NIO also put seven new supercharging stations into operation today, bringing the total to 496, offering 2,858 charging posts.  

Nio's 3 most recent analysts ratings have all been ""BUY"" and been set this month by Mizuho, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank who have all rated this stock as a buy and given price targets of $65, 87 and $70 respectively.  (Currently only $39)

Nio have just signed a deal with Shell, a strategic partnership that includes a plan to install 100 battery swapping stations in China by 2025 and construct and operate pilot stations in Europe from 2022.  

And Earlier this week NIO partnered with oil giant CNPC to build swap stations for first time .

With planned production to be as high as 600,000 cars in 2022 and rapid expansion across Europe in the next 12months I think that Nio is going to pop.

And they have also just raised $2bn, so money certainly wont be a problem either",2021-11-29,6,19

 Chinese EV maker **Nio**  announced Wednesday second-quarter results that exceeded estimates and guided to strong deliveries and revenues for the third quarter. Vehicle margins, however, slipped sequentially. The company also said it's on track to launch three new vehicles in 2022.

**Key Nio Q2 Metrics:** Nio reported a second-quarter loss of $52 million, or a loss of 3 cents per share, on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to the year-ago loss of 18 cents per share and the consensus loss estimate of 11 cents per share.

Revenues came in at $1.3084 billion, up 127.2% from the year-ago's $550.47 million and exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.298 billion. The company had previously guided to second-quarter revenues of $1.243 billion to $1.298 billion.

Vehicle sales accounted for $1.2254 billion or 93.7% of the total revenues.

In the first quarter, the manufacturer of premium EVs reported a narrower loss of 4 cents per share on revenues of $1.22 billion. Second-quarter vehicle margin was at 20.3% compared to 21.2% in the first quarter. A year-ago, vehicle margin was at 9.7%.

Nio ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $7.5 billion compared to the $7.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! We’ve got meme week this week, so expect extra volatility alongside some absolutely stupid price action. I hope you all managed to close some profits last week during the chop. **$FSLY strangles returned 60% while binary options would’ve done around 300%. $ROKU strangles more or less broke even. $UBER and $LYFT both moved in tandem resulting in solid returns for most collateral plays.** I personally played $NKLA (even though I said not to) and lost 19$, while also getting punished by $SMG and losing a small chunk of premium. Managed to close out the week at roughly breakeven, which is honestly a blessing.  Will need to re-evaluate my plan going into this week! That being said, I want you all to be careful. Meme week is often not worth trading, and it may be wise to play the sell side if you’re really looking to scratch the itch. Similar to last week, if you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **$APPS has very expensive options.** Options are pricing in a 14% move, yet Digital Turbine only moves 8% historically. We can abuse this by selling a straddle or strangle and raking in those juicy premiums! The same holds true for $BIDU. Options are pricing in nearly 6%, while historically we get a move of around 2%. In this case, I would be a little more conservative when playing $BIDU, since it’s a Chinese stock, and we all saw how those fared earlier this month. Regardless, the premiums are there should we choose to play.

&nbsp;

- **Sample sizes are small this week. This is both a blessing and a curse.** Many companies who report have only recently gone public, meaning we don’t have our standard 20+ data points to draw conclusions from. For companies with less than a year of ERs under their belts, I wouldn’t look to the historical moves as a reliable metric. That being said, this leads to opportunity. Because some of these companies are so young, it’s going to be extremely hard for market makers to price their options efficiently and put a price tag on each companies potential “growth”. What is a good metric of growth and guidance for Coinbase? What about AirBnB? Literally nobody knows, meaning there’s the potential to make some money due to pricing inefficiencies.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see insane moves. We even got a sneak preview of this last week with $CLNE where we literally closed flat post earnings. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you go long. The best way to trade these tickers would be on the sell side, with OTM credit spreads or strangles. The premiums are extremely nice, and the moves will likely be weak. Keep in mind, this is just a guess, so there’s a chance I’m entirely wrong and get blown out, but I really feel like meme season is over, at least for now. MMs are going to be laughing all the way to the bank with these ones.

&nbsp;

All that being said, this week is shaping up to be awkward, so I’ll likely look to pull the trigger on some plays at the very last minute. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

Meme week up ahead! It’s probably best to sit this week out as it’s extremely difficult to trade with such a limited set of data and such a volatile pool of companies. If you really need to make some plays, look to prioritize the sell side, as those will give us the best risk to reward on our trades. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlrHfP2gEKvQCGAH82WE0geh5jD689U4aNOMuwIwPlg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

### In the News

Robinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we’ve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.

Skew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:

***NIO: Chinese Tesla***   
 

NIO came from the ashes since it reached rock bottom of the pandemic with 1000%+ climb. While Tesla is struggling in the China market due to China government, will NIO overthrown Tesla in the future?  

***About the company***  
 

Just like Tesla - premium electric vehicle manufacturer and designer, combining driving with AI and next-gen tech. Selling through its own “Studio A” – NIO houses, NIO spaces. Most of the revenue comes from selling cars. NIO is partnering with Chinese energy giant Sinopec to deploy over 5000 battery swap stations. They also have a major partnership with state-owned JAC, which manufactures NIO's vehicles through a joint venture that is owned 51% JAC / 49% NIO. The major difference between NIO and other EVs is that NIO uses subscription-service-based battery swap instead of charging.  
 

***Is NIO making money ACTUALLY?***   
 

You can check the details online. However, here’s a simple version: NO, they’re not making profit soon or later. It’s going to be a long run.   
 

***Is NIO worth investing/ trading?***  
 

For swing traders: From what we saw on TSLA and other EV related stocks, the booming trend is clearly over already. It’s going to be about the fundamentals. If you’re really looking for an EV trend, please go for a test drive then move on with your life, it’s not worth it.   
 For Investors: Two MAJOR risks of NIO: First of all, it’s a Chinese company traded in US markets, remember what happened to DIDI? Anything could change in a day if the Chinese government says so, which is big NO as a long-term investor. Also, EV market is extremely competitive, margin is limited with no promises, no certainty.",2021-07-27,2,15

7/20/2021 11:54:36 AM GMT | By [**Ivan Brian**](https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ivan-brian) 

* **NIO stock stages strong intraday recovery on Monday.**
* **Shares opened nearly 4% lower but closed in the green.**
* **NIO breaks the 200-day moving average on Monday.**

A volatile day to say the least in NIO stock and one which many retail traders will be trying to get their heads around. A very weak opening was not too unexpected given the carnage across most equity markets. Take your pick from a list of excuses, be it Delta, earnings or profit-taking. Either way the market was in a bad mood, and bears were in charge of the narrative. NIO looked set to crash lower with an ugly open and a straight break of the 200-day moving average. What followed then was surprising, but regular readers of [**FXStreet**](https://www.fxstreet.com/news) will have given more credence to the zone of high volume that had been identified. [**FXStreet**](https://www.fxstreet.com/) said on Monday that the 100-day moving average would provide the last chance of support before the volume profile and hence support begins to weaken. 

This is exactly what played out. The 200-day moving average was broken early on in Monday's trading, but the 100-day moving average and the psychological $40 level combined to halt the slide. We can also see from the [**chart**](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) just how much volume there is at current levels, meaning the price is moving more slowly here. NIO rallied over $3 or 7% to close up on the day at $43.35, a gain of 1.3%.

**NIO stock forecast**

Now that the initial move has been stabilized, the hard work begins. NIO has retraced right back to the 200-day moving average. But looking at the 30-minute chart shows how little volume transacted at the low end of the day's range. It was not until the price rallied that volume picked up. Psychologically, this tells [**us**](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/united-states) that there was little if any panic selling, a bullish argument. The point of control for Monday was toward the top of the daily range at $43.39.

[TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/pkmp5png5dc71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb4d5b02a4057e8a87ff57fae428075b64aca4e)

Going back to the daily chart, the first obvious test for NIO stock is to retake the 200-day moving average. Once this is achieved, it is back on to trade above the shorter-term moving averages. This will also take out the high of Monday's candle and produce a bullish engulfing candle. There is still a lot of risk here, but the balance is now favoured to the upside in the very short term for three reasons.

1. NIO staged a huge intraday turnaround, flipping from red to green.

2. NIO should break back above the 200-day moving average on Tuesday.

3. The volume profile is high at current levels, meaning there is decent support around current price levels.

While the risk-reward is favouring gains, it is not a strong risk reward. Breakouts and trends are the strong moves to get on, and there is nothing in sight until $45 is cleared. This makes good risk management even more necessary. The market has turned choppy, and with earnings next week from Tesla, that is likely to continue.

 **KEY POINTS**

* **Nio said Thursday it delivered 8,083 vehicles in June, bringing the second-quarter total to 21,896 cars, according to a release.**
* **That quarterly figure came in on the high end of Nio’s forecast for deliveries of between 21,000 and 22,000 vehicles in the three months ended June.**

BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up [Nio](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO) said Thursday it delivered more than 8,000 cars in one month for the first time.

The company delivered 8,083 vehicles in June, bringing the second-quarter total to 21,896 cars, according to a release. That quarterly figure came in on the high end of Nio’s forecast for deliveries of between 21,000 and 22,000 vehicles in the three months ended June.

Nio’s U.S.-listed shares are up 9% so far this year. The company has typically delivered more electric cars a month than two other U.S.-listed electric car start-ups, [Xpeng](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/9868-HK) and [Li Auto](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/L87A-FF). Their shares are up about 3.7% and 21%, respectively, so far this year.

The strong second-quarter performance came despite a decline in [monthly deliveries in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/chinas-xpeng-motors-ev-deliveries-accelerate-and-nio-declines-in-may-.html) from April — which the company had attributed to the global semiconductor shortage.

Nio’s June figures also brought deliveries for the first half of the year to more than 41,900, close to surpassing the total for all of last year of 43,728 cars.

However, the start-up’s deliveries still fall far short of industry giant Tesla, which delivered [184,800 vehicles worldwide in the first quarter alone.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2021-vehicle-production-and-delivery-numbers.html#:~:text=Squawk%20Box-,Tesla%20just%20reported%20first%2Dquarter%20vehicle%20production%20and%20delivery%20numbers,FactSet%20as%20of%20April%201)

o92524_NIO,NIO,Why NIO will be the next “Apple” and the leader of EV’s.,"- EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.
-Best customer service in the world… Wether its at the NIO houses, or providing a utility vehicle if you ever get stranded, NIO wins.
-Building an “Industrial Park” to ramp production to all new levels and have their part manufacturing done right next door.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I’ll throw a 🚀 cuz I know this is WSB 🦍

ALSO: WKHS needs more attention and legitimate diamond hands. Naked shorting, 40-60% SI, fundamentals, and an electric fleet contract stolen from them by under the table money (to a 90% hybrid company that doesnt make engines) I don’t want your support, I want your oath… we need to send the horse to the moon.",2021-06-27,388,256

I’m assuming “Out the Money Call” but how do I determine how far out of the money the premium should be? Again I want the most upside and willing to say goodbye to the premium. Plan to invest as many contracts as I can afford with $100,000.

My target price for NIO is above $100 in one year from today’s price at $46.00.

o0ehpm_NIO,NIO,$NIO shows tremendous potential!! (DD),"I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO – NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the “Tesla of China” but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.

**Company Overview:**

Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Nio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.

Nio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV’s. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.

**Investment Information:** 

*Vehicle Offerings:*

· **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.

· **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.

· **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).

· **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).

*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*

Nio’s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio’s vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.

Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.

Nio’s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through “battery subscriptions”, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.

If a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).

If a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).

*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*

Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with “Nio Pilot”, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).

Consisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.

In January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform “Adam”, and their super sensing system “Aquila”.

Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.

*Electric Powertrain:*

Nio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.

Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)

It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.

*Battery:*

Nio is very committed to R&D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery. 

Their 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.

Their proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).

Nio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.

*Intellectual Property:*

Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA’s, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.

Nio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.

*Financial information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio’s first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&D is important to Nio’s business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.

· **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio’s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio’s business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.

· **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.

· **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as “restricted”, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.

*Management Team:*

One of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio’s management team.

· **Bin Li (CEO & Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China’s automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.

· **Lihong Qin (President & Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).

· **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and CTO at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).

· **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.

· **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry. 

· **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.

**Investment Valuation:** 

The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio’s financial ratio’s/multiples to that of their competitors.

*Comparable Analysis #1:*

In this comparable I compared Nio’s financial ratios to that of [$TSLA – Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV – Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI – Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).

*EV/Assets:*

When comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.

*EV/Revenue:*

By Comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.

*Average Comparable #1:*

By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.

*Comparable #2:*

I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio’s fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.

*Average Comparable #2:*

By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.

*My Thoughts:*

I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a “Chinese stock” and more of a legitimate EV company.

I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio’s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.

**Risks:** 

· **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio’s Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio’s dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.

· **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&D spending by ½, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.

· **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV’s and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio’s superior technology.

Nio delivered 7,257 cars for the month of March, the Chinese EV start-up said in a statement released Thursday. This represented a record monthly total and a 373% increase year-over-year.

The break-up of the monthly total is as follows: 1,529 ES8s, 3,152 ES6s, both of which are all-electric SUVs, and 2,576 EC6 premium smart electric coupe SUVs.

The quarterly number was at a record 20,060 vehicles, up 423% from the first quarter of 2020.

Nio has outperformed its domestic rival XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV), which reported earlier Thursday monthly deliveries that could not beat its January total.

mfwccg_NIO,NIO,NIO DD ! I LOVE THE STOCK !,"For the past 2 months, EV manufacturer NIO has went down by -48% and i'm telling you why you need to buy the fucking dip boiz. 

The big reason to buy the dip is that shares are fundamentally undervalued today relative to the company’s long-term earnings growth potential.

NIO is China’s most dominant premium EV maker, with unrivaled technology and brand equity. On that basis alone, NIO has tremendous long-term revenue and earnings growth potential, since China is the world’s largest auto market and the government there is aggressively supporting EV adoption. MR.Xi  wants China to go full EV by 2030, and when he wants it,  you know it's really going full EV by 2030 and the whole world will follow suit since everyone wants a piece of that chinese Market.

Thus, long-term, China will turn into the world’s largest EV market. NIO is right at the epicenter of that market, with a home-grown brand and industry-leading technology.

But NIO is much more than a China story. Outside of **Tesla**  and maybe **Lucid Motors**  there are no other companies in the world that can rival NIO in terms of battery technology and brand equity. That means NIO can — and will — turn into a global company that, by 2025-plus, will be selling a lot of electric sedans and SUVs in North America and Europe.

After factoring in the global growth potential, it becomes clear that NIO is way undervalued today.

My modeling suggests that NIO is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030. Based on a 25X forward earnings multiple and a 10% annual discount rate, that implies a 2021 price target for NIO stock of nearly $125.",2021-03-29,0,10

# Introduction

Let's get started. If this looks too long for you, please know that half of it is literally pictures. Just gonna say right here that I'm not going to be detailing this down to the point of analyzing every car model the company sells, even though it's probably important. Mainly because I'm lazy and don't want to write that much, but I am for sure no expert in cars at all and I don't have the qualifications to lecture you on car models. Maybe some car genius in the comments will. Also, I'm not gonna be discussing sector rotation or whatever. Figure out how to play it if based on your market thesis. Alright enough chit chat let's get to business.

Keep in mind the recent price range: $38-31

The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.

So to summarize:

\- Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars

\- Offers a multitude of charging solutions

\- Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)

\- Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)

\- Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages

Now that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.

# Market and Competition

**Market**

Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.

The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.

If we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.

**Strategy**

The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.

We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. [Apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/) Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.

BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.

Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.

**Catalysts**

I don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.

\- European Market Expansion

\- Rapid Clean Tech Movement

\- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors

\- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year

\- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here's an article written by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800) claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.

**Local environment**

Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.

This all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.

Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.

\- China is the *largest* EV market in the world, representing roughly *50%* of worldwide sales.

\- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased *550%,* from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.

\- China expects sales to grow nearly *40%* this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.

Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.

# Financials and Numbers

Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.

**Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook**

* Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.
* Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.
* NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What's more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they're projected to do **400%** that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.
* Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%
* NIO generated positive cash-flow
* Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain 'normal'
* Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO's outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.
* NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues

**Q4 Negative Highlights**

* Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year
* With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around \~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.
* Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD
* Operating Losses weren't reduced a whole lot
* Missed EPS estimates
* No dividend

# Investment Outlook

**Analyst Consensus**

Need a third opinion? This is one of the **biggest green flags** IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)

Price targets:

\- HSBC: $49

\- Morgan Stanley: $80

\- J.P. Morgan: $75

\- Deutsche: $70

\- Bank of America: $70

\- Goldman Sachs: $64

\- Daiwa: $100

**Conclusion**

Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of [William Li](https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13), calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.

For this thesis, I think it's important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it's been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV's have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It's also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.

This took hours, hope you enjoyed.

My positions: None, I'm absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.

**TL;DR**

**-** Good growth opportunity

\- Good market (Local environment too)

\- Good strategic approach

\- The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits

\- Huge dip (50% at one point)",2021-03-08,337,238

lx2z3h_NIO,NIO,A message to all the TSLA and NIO and general investors that are selling out and panicking.,"First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I’ve been called a “boomer” for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. 

It’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. 

- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. 

- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. 

When the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. 

About a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai 

https://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/

I think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. 

It’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. 

It’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. 

Personal way of dealing with this: 

When it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it. I’ve done my DD over the companies I’m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I’ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I’d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I’m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I’m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. 

So these are just my observations. Not professional financial advice but the tips are what I personally do.",2021-03-03,280,216

The electric vehicle economic market has been very hot during 2020 and we expect it to only get more interesting as more companies enter the space. With declining CO2 emissions from transportation, we can see the influence electric vehicles have had on climate change and demand for alternative energy. Electric vehicle cars have increased throughout the world with China, Europe, and the U.S. leading the way. The world gained over 1 million battery electric vehicles from 2018 to 2019. China has been influential in increasing electric vehicles on the road. From 17,000 EVs in 2010, to 7.2 million, 47% of the vehicles have come from China (IEA). China’s large market can allow for continued growth as well as increased competition.

The road to a successful electric vehicle company will continue to be filled with an increasing volume of competition. Not only do current companies including BMW, Honda, and Audi all have electric vehicles, but we are beginning to see more SPACs bringing in companies including Churchill Capital (CCIV) with rumored Lucid Motor merger and Hennessy Capital having recently acquired Canoo (GOEV) into the arena. We expect to see an overall increase in demand for EVs but only a few companies will rise to the top.

&#x200B;

[CO2 emissions and intensity have decreased. With the increasing number of electric vehicles on the road, there may not be a direct correlation, but a possible association between clean alternative energy and decreased CO2 emissions. ](https://preview.redd.it/c6jo3912byh61.jpg?width=1667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=303b1c85fbbf98222dfedd081e055f35a6125ea7)

&#x200B;

[Global electric vehicles have increased exponentially, mainly in China, Europe, and the United States. We expect these areas to also be the leaders in alternative energy development and research as they wield major influence in the target of the world. ](https://preview.redd.it/n7zgz112byh61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731fa095278c615fe8bd3759854f0b506e9aedce)

# TESLA (TSLA)

**Overview:**

Tesla has been a hot stock in 2020 and we expect it to continue to be influential not only in the electric vehicle market, but energy, e-commerce, and automation as well. TSLA is known mainly for the creation of electric vehicles including the Model S, the Model 3, the Model X, and the Model Y. However, they also focus on alternative energy generation and storing capabilities. With the announcements of the Cybertruck and the Tesla Roadster, there will be more variety for customers to choose from.

Tesla has also been working on automated technology, using mapping technology to help create self-driving vehicles. Some of their products have self-driving capabilities, but Tesla looks to expand their reach and the safety of using more artificial intelligence in vehicles. Tesla has been investing in Self-Driving Development, using radar and satellite imagery to help map out roadways and look towards further developing automation in the electric vehicle market and transportation market as a whole. TSLA stated in their 10-K SEC Filing that they intend to create a ride-hailing network, accessing a greater number of customers to increase their asset moat.

Tesla provides businesses and residential homes with energy storage units: Powerwall. Powerwall can connect to the grid or charge with solar panels to provide homes or other spaces with electricity when there are outages or just as a common source. The other two products, Powerpack and Megapacks, are more commercial oriented. TSLA began increasing production of their Solar Roof in 2019, competing with other solar panels and possibly providing them straight to the consumer when purchasing other energy storage units.

Gigafactory Shanghai, TSLA’s production in China has acquired beneficial incentives as they tend to local markets. One factor is the 15% income tax, a grant from 2019 through 2023 that is 10% lower than the statutory income tax rate for businesses in China. This lower tax rate can allow TSLA to use extra income to reinvest and obtain larger profit margins than competitors that may not have the same income tax rate.

**Management:**

Elon Musk (CEO): Musk has served as CEO since October 2008. He is currently involved in SpaceX as CEO, CTO, and Chairman of the Board. He has also served as Chairman of SolarCity Corporation until it was acquired in November 2016. He has also started The Boring Company, Neuralink Corp. and assisted in OpenAI. He has received a B.A. in physics from University of Pennsylvania and a B.S. in business from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Zachary Kirkhorn (CFO): Since March 2019, Zach has served as the CFO. He previously served in other financial positions at Tesla since March 2010. Zach has a B.S.E. in economics and mechanical engineering and applied mechanics from the University of Pennsylvania and an M.B.A. from Harvard University.

Andrew Baglino (Senior VP): Drew has been the Senior VP for Powertrain and Energy Engineering since October 2019. He has also worked with Tesla since March 2006. He holds a B.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford University.

Jerome Guillen (President): Jerome has held money positions within the company as Vice President of Trucks, Sales, and Director of Model S Program. Before joining Tesla, Jerome worked with Daimler AG, and Freightliner LLC. He holds a PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan as well as dual degrees in energy technology from Escuela Technica Superior de Ingenieros Industrailes from Madrid and mechanical engineering from the Ecole National Superieure de Techniques Avancees in Paris.

**Risk Factor Summarization from 10K Filing:**

TSLA has experienced product launches and supply chain management from the launches of the Model 3 and Model X. They have experienced part shortages when ramping up Model S and Model X production. Working in what they describe as “an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile” we may see more product issues leading to the increased production of various vehicles and their solar assets.

Batteries for electric vehicles are a main source of discussion and possible issues. TSLA notes their desire to increase supply of lithium-ion batteries by possibly making them themselves. They have a reliance on other suppliers and this relationship can affect the output of Tesla vehicles.

Their global impact is beginning to grow, but they note that they are working under conditional permits in their Berlin Gigafactory and have only been in Shanghai since 2018. There are multiple competitors in the U.S., but then expanding their influence into foreign competition can also cause the company’s success to fluctuate.

**Financial Data:**

Total revenue has increased from $24,578 million (2019) to $31,536 million (2020). With increased profit, TSLA has also increased their working capital exponentially from $1,436 million to $12,469 million. Their assets have almost doubled from $34k million to $52k million in the past year. TSLA has marked their possible inability to payoff debts as a risk factor, but have shown themselves eating at it, decreasing total long-term liabilities from $15,532 to $14,170. Revenue Data shows an increase of 31% of automotive sales as well as a 21% increase in automotive leasing. Similarly, there has been a 30% increase in energy and storage revenues from Tesla’s other assets.

The Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin table shows increase around 24% for all categories. Services and other decreased by 4%, most likely due to COVID impacts and the availability to meet in-person needs. One interesting note on Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin table was the lack of increase in gross margins. As gross margin for energy generation and storage has 1%, a decrease from 12% in 2019. ARK ETF’s CIO Cathie Wood noted that not always meeting gross margin expectations can signify a company reinvesting and if Tesla is reinvesting, then they will be allocating their resources to more assets and research and development that will help the company in the long term.

Research and Development has increased 11% by end of 2020 as Tesla notes the increase is attributed to expanding the roadmap for future years. It does however decrease from 5.5% to 4.7% as a percentage of revenues based on increase in total revenues. Tesla has tripled cash and cash equivalents, from $6,268 million to $19,384 million over the year. Their assets have doubled from $12,103 million to $24,717 million. There was a slight increase in total liabilities from $26,000 million to $28,000 million.

After Battery Day 2020, Tesla has been able to decrease their investment on the formation of batteries by 86% and decreasing their emissions of battery production by 75%. Tesla also pushed to develop Silicon batteries, being the second most abundant element in earth’s crust, silicon is said to store 9x more lithium than graphite, allowing increased battery because of the amount of lithium stored in a single unit. They’ve noted that the amount of batteries recyclable by 2025 will still be minimal as it will be delayed 10+ years. Tesla believes that it’s battery cell production will increase its strength in the electric vehicle market as they integrate their own batteries into cars, strengthening their vertical integration and influence on the market.

**Tesla Sales:**

&#x200B;

[ Tesla sales have remained below 40,000 per year for both the Model S and the Model X. Fortunately, the Model 3 has taken off and is more than tripling the number of sales as the other two models combined. ](https://preview.redd.it/7u4v1912byh61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60d80dbe3d81d1a875064600642e5c7fe66f3388)

As the range has increased from 2015, we see strong development of batteries and hope to see increased range in all Tesla models as they reveal their research and development in the future. ](https://preview.redd.it/0em5h912byh61.jpg?width=1946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54dc05cc7b516c54f12c93755d4c3a50821b4c2d)

[ Total Sales show the Model 3 is the most popular product from Tesla, only being released in 2017 whereas the other two models have been around since 2012. ](https://preview.redd.it/vn0b2212byh61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e36fc56b66ffebf55c2db0c279f1dc26c5a4144)

[ Range of the Tesla Model 3 is greater than the range of the Model X, a possible explanation to the increased sales of the Model 3. Both have similar efficiency factors with the Model 3 being slightly less efficient, thus requiring more electricity and energy to move the car. ](https://preview.redd.it/jxd7u212byh61.jpg?width=1552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=084e7c855c686593497f3ded00a604a007c0e4d0)

Personal Opinion:

Tesla has a lot to offer besides their vehicles. Powerwall and more electricity storage is an area we can see grow, but requires decreased pricing. Compare the Powerwall to a generator and the generator is very expensive. Otherwise, we believe they have experienced management and are at the forefront of research and development in renewable and efficient batteries. They have resources and assets that can provide them an edge against the competition including the decreased tax in China and factory in Europe allowing representation there. With automation developing at a rapid rate, we look to see if Tesla will be able to capitalize on this and create their desired fleet of automated ride hailing service, accessing a new group of consumers while creating convenience to the consumer. There are lots of bumps in the road with critique against its valuation and sales not backing that valuation, but Tesla seems a long run play with their resources and influence. Investing in Bitcoin was also an item we were not able to cover but Tesla acts as a trailblazer behind Elon Musk. We hope to see more success from Tesla.

**Battery Swapping:**

NIO Power:

NIO has several ways to bring power to their vehicles from home and on the road.  At home they have two variants of a wall mounted charger, 7 kW Power Home 2.0 and the 20 kW Power Home Plus.  They also have the NIO Power Swap in which it takes only 3 minutes, at any NIO dealership, to swap out the battery for a fully charged one.  They also have in the works a Power Charger stationed at gas stations that charge from 180 kW-250A, providing a fast and reliable charging.  In cases of emergency such as running out of power on the road; there is no need to worry as Power Mobile, NIO’s mobile charging vans, will arrive to help in a cinch.  You are able to swap out the battery for free 12 times a year or 6 times per month for the original owner.

**NIO Financials Q3 Report:**

NIO had a 22.4% vehicle sales increase from Q2 2020. Total revenues were up 21.7% and gross profit was up 87.1%. NIO has decreased their loss from operations from 1,160RMB to 946RMB. Their Jan. 3, 2021 press release stated that they had sold 7,007 vehicles in the month of December 2020. NIO has had a decrease of 42.3% in research and development expenses from 2019 but has increased it from second quarter 2020 by 8.4%.

Their release of the 100kWh Battery Pack on November 6, 2020 has led to increased reach for various cars - they noted more specifically the EC6. The ES9 and ES6 also have 100kWh capabilities. They expect to deliver 16,500 to 17,000 vehicles for the Q4 2020 report, which is in line with their Jan. 3 2021 news update reporting 17,353 vehicles over 3 months.

**Consolidated Balance Sheet Info:**

NIO has had a very strong increase in assets. From 4.9 million RMB in assets to 26.3 million RMB, NIO has seen a major increase in cash and cash equivalents. They have maintained property and plant equipment assets while also increasing short-term investments. In regards to liabilities, NIO has gained about 1 million RMB’s worth of liabilities from 19 million to 20 million. Short-term borrowings are mostly reliable for the increase in liabilities from 3.1 million to 4.9 million.

**Personal Opinion:**

NIO has a lot going for it with several automobiles in production alongside a strong autonomous vehicle in the works.  Their management is a mixture of expertise that brings people from all corners of the automobile/tech sectors from Ford, Tesla itself, VMWare, and Volvo.  NIO’s CEO is tied up quite well with the Chinese government and as such they would be considered a direct contributor to the company's resources.  Their hold over the sector in China is undeniable but it is yet to be seen if they can compete with a juggernaut like Tesla alongside big names in the industry such as Ford and GM who are gearing up to join the EV competition.  The US market will likely be a hard-fought market but with research labs in Europe and Scandinavia, they may be able to take a sizable portion of the European market.  The Tesla of East may surely take a large portion of the international EV market but dominance is uncertain.

**Conclusion:**

Battery functionality will be a major influence on electric vehicles and a top catalyst for the market. A major market limitation is the batteries and whether it’s NIO swapping batteries when it is dead or Tesla funding electric plug stations, the race to who can obtain a more efficient battery is what will propel companies into major profits. Battery research including PLUG can be another research topic for our team, but we’re excited about what the EV market can provide both on a societal impact as well as the financial opportunities.

It’s also important to assess the effect electric vehicles will have on public transportation and parcel delivery. As the U.S. Postal Service weighs Workhorse (WKHS) for their electric transportation, Canoo is attempting to compete with delivery using the MPDV - Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle. Alternative energies are invading every aspect of life with a multitude of companies. Sales of EVs are on the rise as they’ve been generally increasing in the U.S. throughout the previous decade. NIO and TSLA, both hot stocks in the EV Sector, are companies we believe can contribute to battery development and alternative energy.",2021-02-17,13,5

lgeejm_NIO,NIO,Why I think $NIO will be on the moon. Due Diligence,"**Summary**

*NIO* is a chinese electric vehicle company founded in Nov 2014 had its 1.8 Billion dollar IPO in the U.S. on September 12, 2018. NIO is traded as an ADR (american depository receipt), which is a negotiable security representing an investment in a foreign company, has only been around for 7 years, starting at $9 during its IPO and rising to $56.67 as of 2/5/2021.

It is currently the **fifth largest car company by market cap** under Tesla and Toyota, beating the likes of GM, BMW and Daimler. This is incredible considering they have only been trading in the US for 3 years, and the troubles they have gone through since then.

Pros:

* Low short interest, per yahoo finance.
* Incredibly quarterly sales growth, since having a down quarter in Mar 2020 (Q1). Since then, they have increased 166% and 24.69% QoQ from Q2 to Q3 2020.
* Strong Dec 2020 sales, and deliveries of EV cars increasing 121% YoY.
* Beating analyst estimates in Q3 2020 showing a positive turnaround and forward outlook for the company.
* Unique approach to batteries, all their products use the same battery type and have invested into BaaS.
* New records high quarterly deliveries in 2020 Q3, representing 100% You growth.
* Launch of the 100kWh battery pack, and a focus on providing users with a a choice of purchasing the pack or renting one for a monthly fee.
* Back to back positive cash flow, with vehicle margins increased to 14.5%.
* Battery swap stations are faster than charging stations.
* Delivered 12k ES8/ES6/ES6s/Ec6s in Q3 2020, with 16-17k more expected in Q4 2020.

Cons:

* \-12.1% gross margin in 2019 Q3, rising to 12.9% in 2020 Q3.
* 10/6/2 Buy/Sell/Hold ratings and overweight consensus, per WSJ.
* EPS has been decreasing, while net income was flat for Q3 2020.
* State owned rivals such as Li, Xpeng, and Tesla could pose serious risks.
* They needed a US $1 billion bailout in 2020 because they couldn’t sell their vehicles and even missed payroll in Feb 2020, almost going bankrupt.
* High capital investment industry, with low room for error.
* Overvalued, as investors chase the ‘next Tesla’.

Conclusion

Nio is currently being described as the ‘next Tesla’, though it is 1/10 of Tesla’s market cap. Though Tesla is considered as over-valued by analysts, I believe that Nio has not been profitable long enough to match the level of enthusiasm that investors feel for Tesla. [Nio has had a rocky start, and a recent dip (as of 2/5/2021) as some investors have chosen to cash in on their investments. ](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/december-figures-keep-both-sides-nio-stock-case/)

Take a look at the vehicle margins in Q3 2020 (14.5%) which is a huge turn around from almost going bankrupt in 2020, and not being able to pay for payroll in Feb 2020. They have had an incredible gain in gross profit as well, seeing positive growth from the cash injection they had in 2020. They are also projecting higher estimates for 2020 Q4 (expected in Mar 9, 2021) for vehicle deliveries, while providing unique services that decouple the user from having to go to a charge station.

Tesla had toyed with the idea of swappable battery packs as well, but have never actually deployed them as they re-invested in their supercharger network. Nio has already established a network of swappable battery stations in China, and is actually able to lower the prices of its EV lineup by offering customers the option of renting a battery pack via a subscription model.

This is a turning point, and a make or break moment for Nio. Today I heard they announced the intention to sell vehicles in the U.S. I think they could be huge if they can continue to deliver on vehicles, and I am extremely bullish on it.

* Small amount of positive news ([Huawei](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bb-stock-price-blackberry-ltd-soars-on-patent-deal-with-huawei-202101181109) and [Facebook](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/19/why-blackberry-stock-popped-14-today/) and [Amazon](https://www.fool.ca/2020/12/02/blackberry-partners-with-amazon-is-tesla-next/))

* Huge [PR spin](https://www.google.ca/search?q=blackberry) to bolster the news into a much bigger deal than the numbers convey (click on ""News"" to see all the stories about ""Is this going to be the next big thing"")

This is reminding me of those other ""wonderful"" companies from 2020 that did the same things. Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).

Now I'm wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they've actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!

What do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?",2021-01-21,55,81

l0a446_NIO,NIO,Un Popular Opinion: NIO - Tread Carefully,"Living in Shanghai, China has really helped me stay ahead of the curve on Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and spotting trends. Something I have noticed more over the past month is that the European automakers are selling more and more EV's in the Chinese market. So much so that I am spotting them driving daily more than what makes me comfortable being an early NIO investor. 

Let's be honest about a few things: 

1. Chinese have a lot of disposable income.
2. Chinese love buying European things.
3. Do you really think that NIO, LI, or XPEV's interior and design is better than Germans?
4. NIO delayed their ET7 Sedan until the beginning of 2021 nd their 1000KM battery until the end of 2021. The German sedans are on the roads now. 

Yes, I get it Tesla is going for more of a minimalist interior, but there as far as a luxury vehicle goes - it is kind of lackluster.  I've driven and owned a lot of German cars over the years, in China, and they are still more popular than anything right now in the big cities on the East coast of the Middle Kingdom. 

**How will this affect my NIO stocks?**

By no means am I fear mongering and saying we should all sell Chinese EV stocks now. However, I do believe the Chinese EV companies will start loosing market share. NIO will still hit $100 eventually. I just want to make you aware of the changes taking place on the streets here and you can form your own opinions. Personally, I will not take as big positions any more in these companies, and I will start turning toward more of an EV infrastructure play because no matter who is selling cars they will all need to be charged. Not to mention XPEV's NGP 3.0 might be a game changer in China - more to come on that.",2021-01-19,2,5

So as I'm guessing we all know Chinese stocks are at risk of being de-listed if they do not allow a US auditor to double-check their books, so i decided to look into who these companies are using as their auditors and turns out they ALL use this company PricewaterhouseCoopers, and they are far from squeaky clean having faced many scandals and whistleblowers coming out talking about mal-practice.   
However on a better note PricewaterhouseCoopers also audits a lot of big-name US companies like Bank of America, Chase bank,  Goldman Sachs, IBM, Ford and the list goes on, I would like your thoughts on this

kd2i2c_NIO,NIO,NIO will Moon - The best opportunity this year,"Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity. Buy the dip ya fools!!!   
Take this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. 

China's Domestic Issues:  
\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   
\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. 

EV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off ""fuel"" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. 

International Upside:  
\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   
\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, ""bye bye Tesla"".   
\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. 

Comparables:  
\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   
\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   
\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap ""Made in China"" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  
\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? 

NIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.

Nio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. 

CEO Upside:  
\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   
\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.

Nio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.

Buy Nio.",2020-12-14,196,193

Anyway I came across r/wallstreetbets and after browsing for a few days and keep saying post ""how someone made 10k into 2 million"" and I honestly just got greedy after looking at people over and over, after doing some research and looking into all the price predictions for $NIO from all the analyst, reading the future plans and looking at the past growth..

I went all in on $55 calls for 24th December and it was looking good for the first few days (I purchased them when price was around $52 and that time it didn't seem like it was impossible to increase by $3 seeing the growth YTD)

Now I am watching my savings burn away and holding onto for dear life. Any advice? In your opinion do you think the options will expire worthless?

Edit 1: I am going to find Santa Claus see if he can bring me the gifts

Edit 2: After reading the comments and even though most were discouraging and frankly most laughing at my pain which is fine, but I am more then ever determined to become a good trader, I will study day and night until I get where I want to be, I will work very hard and save up every penny and follow rules so this does not happen and will NEVER happen. I am more then ever determined to learn correctly this time because someone reminded me that “what’s great about hitting rock bottom? There’s only one way left to go and that’s up!” Thanks for everyone who provided advice. I will remember it with each trade I make in future. I will provide update how it turned out in a couple of weeks!

k6fiup_NIO,NIO,A round of applause for (fearless) NIO holders,"Hello all,

This is not going to be your usual NIO post.

Since the delisting news, we all know that it has been quite a ride and by now everyone knows it so we are not going to reiterate that.

With this post, I would like to highly appreciate and applaud those NIO holders who are still holding AND who still believe in this company; which is growing in worlds largest EV manufacturer market and sitting on one of the largest Lithium reserves.

YOU GUYS ARE UNDOUDTEDLY FEARLESS! Hats-off to you and you have my respect for still keep believing this company.

On Tuesday morning NIO reported that it [delivered 5,291 vehicles to customers in November](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nio-scrambles-to-boost-production-after-sales-doub/), more than double its [year-ago total](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/09/nio-november-2019-sales.aspx), on strong demand for all three of its upscale electric SUV models. Demand is so strong, the company said, that it's pulling forward a plan to boost its monthly production output to 7,500 vehicles, hoping to hit that pace by the end of December.

Hence, take a deep breath and HOLD HOLD HOLD!! and if possible, buy the dip! It is a long-haul stock and still got 3 years time. Recall the greed/fear quotation from Mr Buffett.",2020-12-04,152,107
k624pv_NIO,NIO,"If BABA, NIO, XPEV (Chinese stocks) are delisted, what will happen to the stock prices for US investors and also to the leaps that I own?","I own a lot in leaps on BABA and also some in NIO. The house yesterday passed the bill yesterday that the Chinese companies will have to, like all other foreign companies, have to comply with auditing regulations which involves working directly with the Chinese officials in China (much more access than what we have now). (Even though it hurts my wallet, I definitely agree with the legislation). Right now we own ADRs \[ ""An ADR is a stock that trades in the U.S. but represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation. ADRs are bought and sold on American stock markets just like regular stocks, and are issued/sponsored by a U.S. by a bank or brokerage.""\]

Let's say the Chinese government \*doesn't\* comply (which is what I believe because this would be something they'd do). Thus, in 3 years the stocks which we own we'd have to move over to a foreign exchange (Hong Kong or London I'm guessing) if we still wanted to keep them.

My questions are two-fold:

1. Would the fact that US investors can no longer buy these ADRs mean the price of BABA (and other Chinese companies) tank? Or does the supply and demand of US investors not affect the price of the stock at all since this is basically just tied to a foreign stock and the relative supply and demand of US investors is irrelevant?  In other words, if I buy 10 million shares of the stock at market price on TD Ameritrade in the US, would this even  have any effect on the stock price I'm seeing at all?  In other words, if I buy 10 million shares of the stock at market price on TD Ameritrade in the US, would this even have any effect on the stock price I'm seeing at all? 

The reason this is so important is because if it's the case US investors have no impact on the stock price itself, then I still remain bullish on these stocks since nothing has changed with the company fundamentally. If however US investors no longer being able to buy the ADR does have an effect on the price, then I want to sell everything because no one wants to own a stock that could potentially die a few years later.

2. As a related question, I own mostly leaps in BABA. How would owning leaps work out if the stock were to become delisted? Would I have to exercise them and then transfer over?  Are the options solely dependent on the supply and demand of US investors or are these like ADR's of the options on another exchange? Let's say a leap I own still had an extrinsic value of $3000 on it. The next day it's announced the stock will become delisted (let's pretend they could announce it and delist it the next day). Would this mean my leaps would become worthless almost instantly because there would be no investors willing to buy that remaining extrinsic value?

Both these are things are super important I feel. If both aren't answered definitively, I will divest from anything with even a hint of China in it.",2020-12-03,75,73

k4rvp7_NIO,NIO,Nio stock gets upgrade at Goldman Sachs,"‘In hindsight, we underestimated’ Nio, Goldman Sachs says

Goldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.

The analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio’s NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that “the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.”

What’s changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.

The analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio’s American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.

Nio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, “making it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,” the Goldman analysts said.

Existing public charging stalls are often busy, but within “10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.”

“In addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,” they said.

Nio’s ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday’s prices.

k0dzub_NIO,NIO,"[+$1119.39] - 11/24 Trade Review w/ Pics! - TSLA, CGC, NIO, QQQ","Hey r/Daytrading! I thought I would continue my [trend from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/jztlil/1123_trade_review_w_pics_baba_pltr_sq_snap_roku/) of posting my trades and my reasoning behind them while on vacation this week. All trades are entered off of the 2m & 5m time frame (I watch both). The 1m charts in some screenshots are for entry clarity. Stops are at the most recent low on the 2m and then are moved up to subsequent higher lows on the 2m or 5m. Occasionally the bottoms of candles are used if the R:R isn't good enough to use the low. Feel free to leave questions for critiques.

&nbsp;

**TSLA (+$444.5)**

Ticker was at ATHs pre-market and anytime a hype ticker is coming off of ATHs I look to play a bounce when it first hits 5m oversold. 

The 2nd trade was just looking for a higher low on the 15m. I played a smaller position size because while visually TSLA was in the right spot QQQ was at the HOD. I would have been more comfortable if QQQ was also going for a 15m HL.

You can also see in the pic that I closed out 1 share of a 5 share swing position from $435.95 at $540.75 pre-market.  This swing was entered the day after the big gap up off of news TSLA was getting added to the S&P. I closed 2 shares yesterday pre-market so I'm still holding 2. I posed the inital flipping I did to get a good cost basis.

**NIO (+$512.54)**

Same setup as TSLA. Ticker was at ATHs pre-market. There was a nice double bottom on the 2m with 5m & 15m RSI oversold.

Scaled out and then went short after a break over $55 with no follow through. I covered pretty quick to be protective as I was still bullish on the ticker and then went long for a 5m higher low attempt. I took profit on 1/2 of that position when it moved up and was stopped out of the 2nd half shortly after for a roughly breakeven trade for that last one.

[NIO 5m o/s bounce, short scalp, & 5m HL attempt](https://imgur.com/a/Z2GbCyK)

---

**CGC (-284.16)**

Ticker broke resistance on the weekly shortly after the open on increasing bull volume so I was super interested in getting in on any sort of pullback. I was stopped out 3 times on this one, the last time right at the bottom. As a personal rule I will usually only make 2 attempts at a trade like this but I made a 3rd as the guy who runs the trading group I'm in mentioned he was entering. He has a stupid high winrate so I typically make note of or copy his positions if it's a ticker I'm already playing. 

1st attempt was for a bull flag possibility and front running 27 psychological support. I was stopped out for -$50 or so. 

2nd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the .5 fib level and I was stopped out again for around -$50

3rd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the 0.618 fib level. I had my stop at 26.29... so of course it bounced at 26.27 for -$180ish. In hindsight I question entering at this low of a fib level even if a 5m lower high is still the most likely scenario. Not bouncing before the 0.5 fib doesn't matchup with the super bullish signs the ticker was showing off of the open.

[CGC 5m HL attempts](https://imgur.com/a/7hl20b5)

**QQQ (+$446.51)**

Went long with a little starter position after NQ started threatening to break bull out of the 4h EQ. I entered the rest of the shares I had planned on scaling into if it had pulled back from where I first entered of off a 5m HL. I took profit when the 1h chart started to get over extended and it looked like it was due for consolidation. On this sort of breakout I'd normally look to swing some of the position but I've already got an open MNQ swing from around 11200.

I have 300 in NIO and 100 in PLTR. I would be selling NIO for profit and be able to accumulate about 300 shares in PLTR.

My concern is that NIO is slightly over valued (after seeing it being bigger than GM, honda etc) and feel there would be a crash soon. Ignoring the diversification of portfolio etc (this is money I am happy to lose).

It's supposed to be the same value. Look at IWM's premiums compare to it expected move and then compare it to NIO. See what I mean? The premium is pretty rich for a $40 - 50 stock. Also the the maximum expected move is supposed to be pretty close to the standard deviation and the 10day maximum expected range in NIO is 5 strikes away from the 1SD line.

Current two standard deviation range: $60.36 to 35.84 (95.45% chance it stays here)

The above ranges are where I'll be looking to plan some spreads, but will need to see how price action plays out throughout and towards the end of the day first.

Just wanted to throw out this info for those thinking of playing NIO earnings or those that didn't know you could almost 100% guarantee profits with spreads/more advanced options strats. Also with that, less risk = less reward. The higher the probability of success, the lower max profit you will have.

His wife's bf isn't any old Chad, ""Alan E. Salzman is a venture capitalist and managing partner.[1][2] He is the co-founder, CEO and Managing Partner of VantagePoint Capital Partners, a venture capital firm in the U.S. and an investor in Clean technology companies.""

CLEAN TECHNOLOGY.  His wife left him for a fund founder specializing in renewable energy.

VantagePoint has recently acquired a large stake in Chinese EV industry.  

All these years little left nut Andy has been planning this move to take revenge and win back the adoration of his kids.

Read more here about Andrews divorce: https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/prominent-investor-gets-screwed-by-ex-wifes-lawyering-skills/

""Andrea was engaged to be married to another man just six months later"" after their divorce.

Not only that, Andrea didn't get officially re-married to her BF in order to continue cucking Andrew into paying 50k per month in child + spousal support.  She had a wedding, but didn't officially file for a new marriage certificate in order to keep cucking micro peen Andrew. 

""When reached for comment, Andrew had only this to say: “I got screwed. No one knew she wasn’t married. I feel wronged.”

Considering Citron doesn't even allege fraud from NIO, we have the true motive right here!

@SEC time to take a closer look ehh?

@NIO please file suit and fight this in US courts.  He's already banned from the Hong Kong Exchange for similarly spreading lies.  With your help NIO, you can finally put the nail in Citron for good.


On the one hand this gives us all a dollar cost average opportunity.
On the other hand, Citron cannot just spread false rumors and allegations with impunity.  We need to protect the integrity of our markets, and more importantly our Calls.  NIO to the mooon 🚀🚀🚀

To all my fellow call holders, stay strong.  May you find solace in knowing Andrew is still getting cucked hard by his wife's bf.  The bf is a billionaire TSLA investor, and made Andrew lose big on his TSLA shorts.  Additionally the billionaire bf got a court order to force Andrew to pay for half of his new Beverley Hills mansion. https://nypost.com/2017/12/12/tycoons-battle-over-kids-37k-a-month-child-support-payments/",2020-11-16,2106,225

He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) and has clearly been fuming over the profits he’s missed in the past months.

Now he’s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out the lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? 

On to his main point, which is that Tesla’s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of ¥275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO’s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This ¥275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst’s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly naïve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we’re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO’s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD), nor did he write at all about NIO’s uniquely lucrative BaaS program or its ventures into fashion, entertainment, formula racing and more.

jtt96i_NIO,NIO,NIO - new Tesla or new Luckin?,"I'm new to investing, not so good with DDs. There are a lot more talented people than me on this sub. I just want to start a discussion.

&#x200B;

I watched Tesla go from 300 to 700, to 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000+. Since 300$ everyone was saying it's way overvalued and will crash big time. It kept going. 

How is NIO different? It's a good EV company, backed by the government. 

\- EV marked is growing stronger day by day. In Europe it's already hefty fines for companies not selling enough green cars  
\- In Norway in October more than 60% of new registered cars were electric   
\- Chinese government emphasises a lot on environment last few years  
\- Those Chinese EVs get good reviews and anticipated on European marked  
\- My guess, Biden will limit trade war with China and make way for green power/EVs

With other words, EV is both present and future. NIO, NIU, XPENG, LI can capture Chinese marked and get a good share European/US marked.

Paired together with cheaper production in China and government behind their back (NIO), it seems like a winning receipt?   
XPENG got Baba behind them, not bad neither.  
NIU may capture huge scooter market so popular in all Asian countries

https://preview.redd.it/azaejm01d1z51.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abb6a10f77767de4709956ddf354ea95bfb8437

# Trade 1: $QDEL short +$1711.43

Trade thesis: Bear flag on the daily chart, yesterday closed towards lows, looking for any weakness out of the gate to go short w/ target below yesterday LOD.

Trade execution: Out of the gate we get a nice clean dump below VWAP. I jump in full size. I start profit taking on the move down, holding half size into break below yesterday's LOD. Scale out as we confirm break through YLOD, and get stopped out on final 1/8th of position w/ trailing stop.

Lessons/Takeaways: I'm pleased with me execution, but I'd be very hesitant to trade this name again. Within minutes of open, spread became abysmal and volume started drying up. Too risky for the kind of size I trade with.

# Trade 2: $PTON short +$266.38

Trade thesis: Looking like a potential daily bear flag and forming a tightening range below VWAP while struggling to break 50D SMA. 

Trade execution: Went short with small size on first 1m candle to break low. I wanted to see a break down below LOD and we didn't get it, so I covered on the way back up. 

Lessons/Takeaways: I don't regret exiting this trade even though it ended up dumping later. The break back over 50D SMA and VWAP would've been way too bullish for me to be holding short, and this would've been a losing trade had I not exited. By the time it came back down, I had moved on to other names.

# Trade 3: $MRNA long +$549.81

Trade thesis: In a daily up trend heading towards all time highs. 7$ pocket between 11/12 HOD and all time highs. Looking for a break through 11/12 HOD and a squeeze into area of no resistance. 

Trade execution: Took full size on break through yesterday HOD. Exited half on rejection of $88.50 to lock in profits. Exited another 1/4 below $89. Threw a $0.80 trailing stop on and got stopped out quickly.

Lessons/Takeaways: Solid execution overall. A little trigger happy on the sell below $88.50, but that topping tail made me jumpy. 

https://preview.redd.it/hs1nvdf481z51.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e5e8764074802b8d67fbf6eb65bd60d9910758

# Trade 4: $BABA short +$474.81

Trade thesis:  In a sharp daily downtrend. Multiple rejections off \~$272 100D SMA resistance with a close near the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD and 4H bear flag confirmation. On intraday, grinding between yesterday LOD, today LOD, and VWAP. Looking for clean break below today LOD.

Trade execution: Took half size on break below LOD. Covered above low of dip. Covered 1/4 on mini 1m bear flag confirmation, stopped out on remaining position. 

Lessons/Takeaways: Happy with execution over all. Could've added on break below low of dip. Could've also had wider trailing stop. Used a $1 trail instead of my normal 1%, which would be $2.60ish.

Trade thesis: Had this on the watchlist as a potential momentum long. Noticed a blow off top (tailing top candle on top of a parabolic move) on the daily chart. Saw 2 potential short entry points and a head and shoulders look. 

Trade execution: Took half size starter position on first 1m candle to make new low on VWAP rejection. Added to full size on confirmation of imperfect head and shoulders. Covered 1/2 into initial dump. Break even level has plenty of cushion now. Covered another 1/4th into next leg down. Made a good lot of my profits on the last leg down with a $0.50 trailing stop.  

Lessons/Takeaways: Probably my cleanest execution out of all 5 trades today. If you follow me, you'll notice many times the trailing stop on the last 1/4 or 1/8 position doesn't always add to my profit, but it never cuts deep into my losses. It's trades like these that make that strategy pay off. \~Half the gain came from that final quarter position.

# Trade 1: $QDEL short +$1711.43

Trade thesis: Bear flag on the daily chart, yesterday closed towards lows, looking for any weakness out of the gate to go short w/ target below yesterday LOD.

Trade execution: Out of the gate we get a nice clean dump below VWAP. I jump in full size. I start profit taking on the move down, holding half size into break below yesterday's LOD. Scale out as we confirm break through YLOD, and get stopped out on final 1/8th of position w/ trailing stop.

Lessons/Takeaways: I'm pleased with me execution, but I'd be very hesitant to trade this name again. Within minutes of open, spread became abysmal and volume started drying up. Too risky for the kind of size I trade with.

# Trade 2: $PTON short +$266.38

Trade thesis: Looking like a potential daily bear flag and forming a tightening range below VWAP while struggling to break 50D SMA. 

Trade execution: Went short with small size on first 1m candle to break low. I wanted to see a break down below LOD and we didn't get it, so I covered on the way back up. 

Lessons/Takeaways: I don't regret exiting this trade even though it ended up dumping later. The break back over 50D SMA and VWAP would've been way too bullish for me to be holding short, and this would've been a losing trade had I not exited. By the time it came back down, I had moved on to other names.

# Trade 3: $MRNA long +$549.81

Trade thesis: In a daily up trend heading towards all time highs. 7$ pocket between 11/12 HOD and all time highs. Looking for a break through 11/12 HOD and a squeeze into area of no resistance. 

Trade execution: Took full size on break through yesterday HOD. Exited half on rejection of $88.50 to lock in profits. Exited another 1/4 below $89. Threw a $0.80 trailing stop on and got stopped out quickly.

Lessons/Takeaways: Solid execution overall. A little trigger happy on the sell below $88.50, but that topping tail made me jumpy.

# Trade 4: $BABA short +$474.81

Trade thesis:  In a sharp daily downtrend. Multiple rejections off \~$272 100D SMA resistance with a close near the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD and 4H bear flag confirmation. On intraday, grinding between yesterday LOD, today LOD, and VWAP. Looking for clean break below today LOD.

Trade execution: Took half size on break below LOD. Covered above low of dip. Covered 1/4 on mini 1m bear flag confirmation, stopped out on remaining position. 

Lessons/Takeaways: Happy with execution over all. Could've added on break below low of dip. Could've also had wider trailing stop. Used a $1 trail instead of my normal 1%, which would be $2.60ish.

I also closely observed XPEV and NIO today  and considered purchasing but backed out.. Still feeling unsure with investments in China at this time.",2020-11-13,20,36
jtfje5_NIO,NIO,NIO Discussion," 

Let's have a serious DD in state of all the raging fire going on in the market right now. Let's debate and align ourselves to our goal and the direction of the company. Let's begin!

Nio competitors (Can we beat them?):

1. BYD
2. XPEV
3. Li
4. almost all the other EV out there in the market

How is NIO ahead of their competitor besides luxury and BaaS which is easily copied.

Pros:

1. NIO is a startup and currently at a growth phase. Go back to your fundamental and tell me, is NIO currently overprice or severely overpriced
2. Large Total Addressable Market
3. BaaS is attractive especially taxi fleet and robotaxi in the future
4. Chinese government backing (A reason why everyone is investing in it right?)

Cons:

1. Dependent on government backing out from funding. (Come on its possible)
2. I've been to China, there are Tesla car everywhere (Status). Foreign cars are perceived better there.
3. It may be profitable, but not so soon. OR NEVER since they have high capex businesses. There are many firm going bankrupt as a reason for that
4. Their the firstmoover for Baas but it is not an advantage... It is easily copied and follow by the rest of its competitors
5. Priced to perfection
6. It is reliant on third party like JAC motors. How are they going to get their own factory? How much dilution is it going to take to raise money for a factory to keep up with the demand? Can we assume that NIO's factory will be as good as JAC motors?
7. Risk of BaaS station catching fire due to poor quality in the long run. It is going to be a pain to keep having new batteries as it is costly. The only way to preserve quality in the long run is to always use new batteries to swap the vehicles (Which cost tons of money.)

In the event whereby cars starts catching fire due to poor maintenance of batteries, the brand is going to get tarnish.

8) Are quality assurance audited?

I would love a good debate and I wish everyone respect each other opinions on the direction of this company. Let's have a breakdown and a good analysis of this company.

God bless!",2020-11-13,122,88

**$QDEL**

Big gap down, just looking for a lower high on this bounce, looking bull flag-ish. Rejected 50D SMA then closed towards the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD to go short, with about 7% room to run before next support.

https://preview.redd.it/uqnqivx5ywy51.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f3b22c735ccd9aa194ae2b242b47520319aeab

**$OXY**

In a multi week downtrend. Gap up with double top rejection at $12.70 below 100D SMA. Closed towards lows. Juicy gap fill below 11/12 LOD, no support until 50D SMA.

https://preview.redd.it/kif5nw7oywy51.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ee5cc7c855f92c1c7d28e2e2809638c33a0952

In a sharp daily downtrend. Multiple rejections off \~$272 100D SMA resistance with a close near the lows today. Looking for break of 11/12 LOD and 4H bear flag confirmation.

# Short or Long Setups

**$PLUG**

Massive multiday rip with a spinning top candle 11/12. Could signal a reversal, and see a nice dump below LOD. Could also catch shorts sleeping and squeeze above HOD. Either play I'd be scalping and taking most profits off the table pretty quickly. As with all names, don't anticipate, wait for key levels break.

**$PTON**

Gap down with some tailing dojis on a bounce. Today we closed just over 50D SMA. If this holds and we break 11/12 HOD, could see nice move into gap fill territory. If we break back below 50D SMA, there's not much room before 11/12 LOD, and no support until 99.83. Nice pockets on both sides.

# Long Setups

**$AAPL**

Bull flag on Daily/4H within a bull flag on weekly/monthly. Closed above 50 and 20D SMA. Looking for break of $122 with room to run until $125.39.

**$MRNA**

Broke several key resistances recently. If we break 11/12 HOD tomorrow, we have room to run until all time highs at $95.21. High headline risk name.

jse87s_NIO,NIO,$NIO third Quarter Earnings (Reasersh),"Hello everyone,

I did a little research about the expectation for Nio third quarter to explain how it would be mind-blowing.

Firstly, as we all know until now the company has not earned anything, all earned previous earnings were negative.

Second, the third quarter this year has many achievements and they were **epic** 

[NIO Inc. Provides September and Third Quarter 2020 Delivery Update](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-september-and-third-quarter-2020)

third, in Q2 this year, the earning was (-0.15).

and if we check achievements in the Q2, there is no big news

[NIO Inc. Provides June and Second Quarter 2020 Delivery Update](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-june-and-second-quarter-2020) 

&#x200B;

ِEven tho with no big news, if we compare Q2 from 2019 with Q2020, it was a huge difference. Q2 2019 was (-0.46).

we can see that the percentage difference is (**67.39%**), and this difference is without any big news, so imagine what would be with the Q3 big news.

Finally,

I hope that you like my research really about a without and I feel really bout optimistic with this q3 earnings, and I believe our minister finally would have positive earnings. Best of luck to all of us.",2020-11-11,74,87

Shorting a stock is when a person sells a stock (and can be done without ownership of that stock) in anticipation of buying it back at a lower price.

My father asked me what stock I was looking at. I told him Nio. He asked me what it was all about, so I told him Chinese electric vehicles.
He asked me how much I was going to invest, so I jokingly said 50 grand. That would've meant I was going to sell and reinvest my ENTIRE portfolio; not likely.
He apparently took this at face value.
Today he texted me saying he'd invested all his savings - more or less £50,000 - into Nio at $2 a share.

I hope this is not an obvious answer question, but I'm genuinely concerned about it.

The company, started by William Li Bin in 2014, delivered 3,226 of its ES6 sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in September, a year-on-year increase of 87 per cent, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In August, its sales rose 58 per cent, with the company selling 2,840 ES6s.

Tesla, on the other hand, led the sector by quite a distance last month, by a margin of 8,103, having delivered 11,329 of the Model 3 cars built at its Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3. In June, however, the gap between Tesla and Nio was wider, at 12,478, with 14,954 Model 3s sold and 2,476 ES6s delivered.

“Strong sales over the past three months have cemented a belief among China’s home-grown new energy vehicle companies that Tesla is not unbeatable,” said Gao Shen, a Shanghai-based independent analyst covering the manufacturing sector. “Chinese carmakers, although still lagging behind their US rival, can eventually catch up if they churn out proper and affordable products for domestic drivers.”",2020-10-16,317,150

Analyst Nick Lai of JP Morgan raised his price target on the Chinese electric-vehicle maker all the way to $40 from $21—almost double where the stock trades (as of 10/13).

That is double NIO’s average price over the past month and nearly double where the stock was trading before the bullish call.

Lai thinks China’s EV penetration will be four times higher by 2025, meaning that about 20% of all new cars sold in China would be battery powered. That is good news for all EV players. Lai also rates the stock of Xpeng (XPEV) a Buy, with a $27 price target. He doesn’t cover the other pure-play Chinese EV startup Li Auto (LI).

I did some research into NIO. I know it has been operating at a loss, but I like their business model, in particular the battery swapping system and the recently launched BAAS( battery as a service); you can buy the car without battery at a huge discount and then subscribe to loan a battery. I think long term this model may be better than the Tesla supercharger system( it prevent the batteries from deteriorating). The problem I see is that it seems a business model difficult ( or at least expensive) to export outside China, and one that make impossible for them to sell cars outside China before building swapping stations in the countries they want to sell cars. Luckily , the chinese market may be big enough in the coming years.

ijupmx_NIO,NIO,NIOs worst time to make a share offering?,"So after the bullish week NIO had last week, they decided to make an offering of 75mm shares. Since the price tanked, they decided to make a second offering to rise the goal of 1.5 billions... Just months after they secured funding from the chinese goverment for that same amount of dollars.

Many seem to believe the offering is well placed due to the run and because they wanted to increase their ownership from around 70 to 80 something percent.

From a shareholders perspective, this seems to be a very dodgy move. I believe this is more about greed than anything else by the company's management. 70-80% ownership does not have any meaningful value since they already have the majority of the company's ownership.

In any case, we will see how the market reacts (already down 5% in pre market). And as a typical case of dodgy moves by the chinese, I consider this a risky bet at this price range. I am setting a stop-loss at 16.5 level and might reenter the stock at a latter date. 

 Adding  volatility to an already volatile stock... Do you think this was a smart move for NIO? Do you believe the buy orders will support the current levels ?  

Congrats to all that managed to get the stock at 2-10 bucks level and are fine with the volatility or took profits.",2020-08-31,3,12

But that means after just six years, the amount paid in fees would exceed the initial savings at the time of purchase. 

The new **battery-as-a-service** (BaaS) program gives buyers the option to buy the car and subscribe separately to use the batteries, lowering the price tag. The typically higher costs of electric cars have weighed on global sales.

The emerging **Tesla** rival has also *set up a new battery company,* ***Wuhan*** *Weineng Battery Asset Company.* It will purchase the batteries, then lease them to Nio subscribers.

It allows Nio users to benefit from the lower initial purchase prices by approx. $10,000, flexible battery upgrade options.

h0281d_NIO,NIO,"NIO, SOLO, and other EVs?"," NIO just passed the Pennystock territory last week but I still think its relevant since SOLO and NKLA saw insane growth this week. NIO is currently up 10% today and I think there's room to run.

If you look at the institutional investors since the beginning of June you'll see that a bunch of shares were bought up, including Vanguard and Kensho New Economies Composite ETF who both bought up 1.6 million and 1.5 million shares respectively. Someone knows something and they're ahead of the curve. If you're not playing with the big guys you're playing for the wrong team.  NKLA has a market cap of 30 billion with no product. NIO has a market cap of 5 billion and they're actually making cars/deliveries. At the current price, if NIO actually hit 30B market cap, the stock would easily be worth $30 bucks a share. 

The same thing happened with $XELA in which Vanguard bought 1.2 million shares on June 1st. I sold for a nice 30% gain but never expected $XELA to pump 90% today. Learned my mistake and if I see big investors like Vanguard picking up an ungodly amount of shares I'm gonna ride with them especially now when EV stocks seems to be rallying. Rising tides lift all boats. 

Anyone else know of any good EV stocks to look out for?

Started trading options at the beginning of February and all my money is leveraged. Also any thoughts on Andrew Left? I was feeling fine until I learned (not through his sight) that he sold his Nio shares

9hi7sn_NIO,NIO,Millennials are snapping up the 'Tesla of China' since its IPO (NIO)," **Nio shares have gained 46% since their IPO, and is the 29th most held stock on Robinhood.** 

[According to Evercore ISI's Arndt Ellinghorst,](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-of-china-nio-stock-price-market-cap-could-double-five-years-2018-9-1027535891?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral) China could have 4 million electric vehicles in 2023, with Nio  likely grabbing around 13% of total market share and 42% of the mid-  and premium- electric market. That'll cause its revenue to double that  time, he said.

What are your thoughts on NIO?

It has its IPO in a couple weeks and it looks like some of Tesla's backers are involved quite heavily with NIO as well:

>A quick check of Tesla's most recent proxy statement shows Baillie Gifford owned 12.9 million shares as of December 31, 2017, giving the firm a 7.6% stake in Tesla and ranking them as the company's number three shareholder after Musk and Fidelity.  It was widely reported at the time of Tesla's March 2017 follow-on offering that Tencent had acquired a stake of just under 5% in Tesla via participation in the deal. If those shares are still held, it means that Tesla's third and fifth largest shareholders--owning a combined 12.6% of the company--are also invested in one of the company's key competitors.

​

The specs of their electric car are comparable to Tesla vehicles in speed and charging but are a little cheaper.  With tariffs, they may make a comparable price in the US.  Financials don't really tell a story yet IMO.

​

Has anybody done any research on them?",2018-08-29,10,6
