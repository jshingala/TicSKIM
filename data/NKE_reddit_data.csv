1jz3v6n_PATH,PATH,Nike: Just Buy It? [Long-Form Write-Up on $NKE),"There are very few companies where the brand name and logo immediately come to mind when you think of an industry or product.

Phones? Apple.

Search? Google.

Shoes? Nike.

Nike is one of those rare businesses that doesn't just sell products — it shapes culture, identity, and aspiration. But despite that iconic status, the company is facing one of the most challenging stretches in its modern history.

Sales are slowing, margins are under pressure, and tariffs threaten the entire supply chain. Add to that a shaky DTC strategy, strained wholesale relationships, and a stretch of underwhelming innovation, and you’ve got a company in the middle of a full-blown reset.

**From the Track to the Racks**

Nike’s story starts on a track in Oregon. In the 1960s, University track coach Bill Bowerman teamed up with his former student Phil Knight to sell high-quality Japanese running shoes in the U.S. under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.

Their inspiration? Japanese cameras. At the time, brands like Canon and Nikon were taking market share from dominant German makers. Bowerman and Knight believed the same disruption could happen in footwear, where Adidas and Puma ruled the track.

So they partnered with Japanese shoe manufacturer Onitsuka Tiger, and the business took off. Sales grew, momentum built — until they found out Onitsuka was quietly shopping for new U.S. distributors behind their back.

Feeling betrayed, Bowerman and Knight made a bold decision: go solo. No more reselling — they’d make their own shoes.

And just like that, Nike was born. One of the most iconic brands in the world was created in a matter of days. The name “Nike” came from the Greek goddess of victory. The Swoosh? Designed by a college student for $35.

But don’t worry — a few years later, Knight gave her 500 shares of Nike. If she held on, that little logo turned her into a millionaire.

Nike’s early strategy was simple but effective: selling shoes straight out of car trunks at track meets, building personal relationships with runners, and even creating one of the first informal customer databases — tracking shoe sizes, race schedules, and athlete preferences to stay connected. It worked. The first 50,000 pairs were sold almost entirely through word of mouth.

One of the most iconic early models was the Moon Shoe — designed by Bowerman and inspired by his attempt to improve traction using a waffle iron from his kitchen.

Perhaps the first signal of just how far Bowerman and Knight were willing to go to build the best running shoes in the world — and the Moon Shoe became their first true breakthrough.

From there, Nike’s innovation streak took off: the Waffle Trainer, Air cushioning in the Tailwind, and later the futuristic Nike Shox, made famous by Vince Carter’s Olympic dunk over a 7'2"" Frenchman in 2000.



**The Best Deal in Sports History**

While Nike’s early models laid the foundation for its reputation in performance and innovation, what truly catapulted the company into global dominance was arguably the greatest marketing move in sports history.

In October 1984, Nike signed a young, promising rookie named Michael Jordan. It wasn’t an easy deal — Jordan had his heart set on Adidas, but they weren’t focused on basketball then. Nike saw the opportunity and took a bold swing.

They offered him a five-year, $2.5 million contract, which, at the time, was basically their entire marketing budget, and built an entire brand around him. The goal was to sell $1 million worth of Air Jordans in the first year.

Instead, they sold $126 million.

That single bet didn’t just change Nike’s trajectory — it redefined how athletes, brands, and marketing would work for decades to come.



**The Landscape is Changing**

For a long time, there were two dominant players in the global footwear and apparel industry: Nike and Adidas. And yes — both still lead the pack. But the momentum has shifted, and lately, it hasn’t been in Nike’s favor.

In the U.S. market, Adidas has grown its share from 6% to 11% over the last decade, while Nike’s share has stagnated. At the same time, a new trend has emerged: smaller, performance-focused brands are entering the market and gaining serious traction. Two of the most talked-about in recent years are the Swiss brand On and the French brand Hoka.

Before we dig into the impact these rising players have had — and Nike’s loss of global market share — it’s worth asking: How did we get here?

Like most major shifts, it’s not monocausal. A handful of factors played a role. But in Nike’s case, there’s a particularly clear catalyst: the company’s DTC pivot under former CEO John Donahoe — a strategy that, in hindsight, didn’t play out the way investors had hoped.

Nike originally built its dominance through wholesale. For years, it was the undisputed leader in almost every major shoe retailer. But if you look at the 2024 numbers, Nike’s wholesale-to-DTC ratio is now only slightly tilted in favor of wholesale — a big shift from how the business used to operate.

That change began in 2017, when Nike made a strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer. Under then-CEO Mark Parker, Nike’s digital business took off. In 2014, online sales totaled just over $1 billion. Five years later, that number had grown fivefold.

The direction seemed clear: Nike would leverage its brand power by focusing more on DTC, especially through digital channels.

And then came what looked like a perfect fit. Just a few years earlier, John Donahoe had joined Nike’s board. With experience as CEO of eBay and ServiceNow, and as Chairman of the Board at PayPal, he brought deep digital expertise. So when Parker stepped down, Donahoe — the tech operator — was tapped to lead Nike into its next phase: a digital-first future.

Before Donahoe, Nike had only three CEOs. First, the founder, Phil Knight. Then William Perez, Nike’s first external hire, and finally, Mark Parker, who came up through the company and led for over 13 years. Perez, on the other hand, lasted just two. He left after being deemed “not a good cultural fit.”

At Nike, culture matters. It’s a fuzzy term — one that’s often used as corporate filler. I’m the first to roll my eyes when someone brings up “culture” in a boardroom pitch. But there’s a difference between talking about culture and living it — and Nike has always lived it. You see it in the stories, the athlete relationships, and the leadership style. More on that later when we talk about Elliott Hill, Nike’s new CEO.

*(Just a quick note, I share stock breakdowns like this weekly, with charts and downloadable valuation models, in free emails — subscribe* [*here*](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit) *if that interests you.)*

The problem Nike had with Perez came back with Donahoe. Despite years on the board, he never quite embodied the Nike way. He led like a consultant, which isn’t all that surprising given his background. Before eBay and ServiceNow, Donahoe spent 20 years at Bain & Company, one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world, eventually becoming CEO and President.

Still, despite the cultural mismatch, Donahoe’s first year as CEO looked like a success. Nike quickly doubled online revenue, surpassing $10 billion in digital sales. The pandemic certainly helped — stores were closed, and running became a go-to hobby when it was one of the few things people could still do outdoors.

It was around this time that Donahoe said what’s now become an almost iconic quote: “The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back.”

Well… the consumer did revert back.

People were eager to get out again and experience shopping in person. And honestly, I get it. Call me old-school, but I’ve never really understood how people buy shoes online. I need to try them on, walk a few steps. If I ordered without trying them, I’d be sending 90% of them back.

But let’s get back to Nike’s problem. A major part of the DTC strategy was cutting ties with wholesalers — including Foot Locker, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and many others. The idea was to drive more traffic through Nike’s own channels. But that came at a cost.

Just Foot Locker and Dick’s alone have around five times as many stores as Nike does across the U.S. Cutting those partnerships meant walking away from shelf space — and from millions of eyeballs, free marketing, and the impulse purchases that come with it.

Naturally, a lot of shoppers didn’t head straight to Nike stores — they went to wholesalers. Many of them probably still wanted to buy Nike shoes. And historically, they could. Nike was the No. 1 brand in almost every major retailer. In 2020, 75% of Foot Locker’s inventory comprised Nike and Jordan products.

That changed quickly.

After Nike decided to scale back wholesale partnerships, Foot Locker’s Nike allocation dropped by more than 20%. Other retailers saw even steeper declines. The move hurt both sides — retailers lost a key traffic driver, and the abrupt decision caused many to lose trust in Nike.

And when Nike realized it had overestimated its brand pull, it was already in a tough spot. Consumers weren’t walking out of Foot Locker empty-handed and heading to the nearest Nike store — they were just buying something else. The shelves were filled with other brands, and to the retailers’ surprise, those brands sold just fine.

So when Nike tried to return, it no longer had the same leverage. Retailers didn’t feel the urgency to bring Nike back at the same volume — or on the same terms.

And that opened the door for a new wave of brands like On and Hoka. Both were founded by athletes, both offered innovative technology, and both captured consumer excitement, especially among runners and performance-focused shoppers.

Which leads us to Nike’s second big mistake during its DTC push: It neglected the product.



**The Decline of Nike Shoes**

I’ve mentioned how Nike used to be an innovation machine. In its early days, product came first — and Nike made sure that mindset stayed at the core of the company. That’s what culture meant at Nike: being product-obsessed, hungry to win, and always pushing new ideas forward.

But in recent years, Nike has lost that edge. There haven’t been many groundbreaking innovations. Sure, there have been announcements — but not much to back them up.

So what happened?

As the company focused on building out its online presence, the product took a back seat. Resources were reallocated, and the goal quietly shifted — from making the best shoes to making more shoes, in order to drive DTC volume and hit digital growth targets.

That’s why we got wave after wave of Air Max and Air Jordan re-releases in every colorway imaginable — instead of truly new technology. And to be clear: I like those shoes. A lot of people do. But when you flood the market with them, they start to lose their appeal.

For years, Nike struck the perfect balance — selling at scale while still keeping sneakerheads engaged through scarcity, excitement, and originality. But as the product strategy leaned too far into mass availability, that balance began to slip—and with it, demand.

Under Donahoe, the balance tipped further toward the volume game, while Nike drifted away from speaking to sneaker culture — the very community that helped build its brand. And look, it would be easy to pin all of this on Donahoe. But that wouldn’t be fair — or true.

Nike’s size alone makes it incredibly hard to tailor products to every consumer. Smaller brands like On and Hoka are naturally more agile and can move faster in terms of both design and messaging.

But here’s the thing: Nike has always had that disadvantage. Long before Donahoe ever became CEO. Something else changed.

What changed was how Nike approached its customers.

Historically, Nike thrived in what’s called a pull market — where you first create a product, and then create demand for it. And Nike mastered this model for two key reasons:

First, it was relentlessly product-focused. The innovation was there. The designs were there. Nike shoes didn’t just look good — they performed. In 2019, Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon distance in under two hours. The controversy? His Nike Vaporfly shoe. Designed so well, it was rumored to have a material impact on the runner’s time. World Athletics even banned the shoe from subsequent races.

Second, Nike had — and still has — the most powerful athlete portfolio in the world. From Michael Jordan to Serena Williams, LeBron James to Cristiano Ronaldo — no brand has paired product with star power as effectively as Nike.

I know firsthand how powerful Nike’s pull factor used to be. As a kid, I didn’t just want football shoes — I wanted the exact pair my favorite player wore. Nothing else mattered. The same goes for kids who idolize basketball players, tennis stars, golfers, or even celebrities. Nike made it easy to create demand because when you combined that emotional connection with a high-quality product, Nike was unbeatable.

But in recent years, that model started to break down. As Nike shifted away from its product-first mindset, it also moved away from operating in a pull market. Instead, it started behaving like a typical push brand — trying to predict what consumers wanted and then building products to match.

That approach doesn’t work for Nike.

They’re too big, too slow, and frankly, too far removed from niche consumer trends to play that game well. And more importantly, they’ve historically had an edge most brands could only dream of: the ability to shape taste, not follow it.

But once Nike realized it couldn’t reliably guess what consumers wanted, it made a familiar move — it doubled down on its legacy models. As I mentioned earlier, that’s how we ended up with a flood of Jordans and Air Maxes in every color combination imaginable.



**Reviving Nike — Win Now!**

Last October, a new chapter began at Nike. Elliott Hill returned to the company — this time as CEO — after working his way up through Nike’s ranks from 1988 to 2020. He started as an intern. When he left, he was the President of Consumer and Marketplace.

Hill understands and embodies Nike like few others. For perspective, when he joined in 1988, Nike’s market cap was around $700 million. Today, Nike generates that much in revenue every five days.

Since returning, Hill has wasted no time. He launched what he calls the Win Now strategy — a plan to get Nike back on track by doing what it once did best: focusing on product, rebuilding retail relationships, partnering closely with athletes, and returning to a pull market model.

The shift is already showing up in bold marketing moves. Nike just ran its first Super Bowl ad since 1998, spending $16 million on the campaign. They signed Caitlin Clark, the biggest name in women’s basketball, to a $28 million deal. And — this one hits especially close to home — they signed a $700 million sponsorship deal with the German national football team, ending a 70-year partnership with Adidas.

Beyond bold marketing moves, Hill is also shifting focus away from the volume game that defined Donahoe’s DTC strategy. His goal is to re-establish Nike Direct as a premium destination — not just a high-traffic sales channel. He’s been clear: Nike became too promotional in recent years.

Now, Nike isn’t a luxury brand, but it has always carried a premium image. And if you read our Moncler newsletter, you’ll remember why excessive discounting can damage that kind of brand equity.

It didn’t just hurt Nike’s image — it hurt retailers, too. Whenever Nike slashed prices, retailers were forced to follow suit just to stay competitive. That strained relationships and further complicated Nike’s wholesale reset.

But that chapter’s behind them — at least in intention. Since taking over, Hill has been on the road nonstop, visiting wholesalers, Nike factories, and athletes around the world. His message? “We have to earn our way back to the shelves.”

But that was October. So now the big question is: How’s the “Win Now” strategy going?

**Recent Results — Win Later?**

Well, there’s not much that suggests Nike is “winning now” — at least if you’re looking strictly at the numbers.

In the most recent quarter, sales declined 9% overall, with drops across every brand, region, and sales channel. Gross margin took a heavy hit, falling 330 basis points (3.3 percentage points) to 41.5%. And if you looked at the EPS and thought, “Well, that’s not that bad,” keep in mind: it was propped up by a 10% drop in the effective tax rate — a one-off that helped polish otherwise rough results.

So, why is Elliott Hill’s confidence “reinforced”? Why does he say Nike is on “the right path”? Is he seeing different numbers than the rest of us?

I don’t think so. And believe it or not, I actually don’t dislike the recent trends as much as the headlines suggest.

Yes — the results are not good. And they’re even going to get worse. Nike’s guidance for Q4 includes mid-teen revenue declines and a 5% drop in gross margins.

But here’s the thing: the Win Now strategy was never meant to deliver short-term wins. Hill made that clear from the beginning. He said his plan would hurt the numbers in the short run, but he’s taking the long-term view. I know, calling it “Win Now” is a bit of a lie then. But honestly, would you call your strategy “Win Later?”

One of Hill’s first major tasks was reducing Nike’s inventory problem. After pandemic-era supply shocks eased, a flood of delayed product hit Nike all at once, leaving them with several seasons’ worth of inventory. Fixing that was going to hurt. But it was necessary.

Retail brands like Nike suffer tremendously when inventory levels get out of control. It clogs up the cash flow statement — you’ve already spent the money to make the product, but you're not getting paid because it’s just sitting there. The longer it sits, the more working capital is tied up and the higher the carrying costs.

But clearing that inventory also comes at a cost. You have to discount heavily to move product quickly, which not only hurts margins but also dilutes the brand and strains retailer relationships.

Hopefully, by now, you can see how everything we’ve discussed — from the DTC pivot to product missteps and retailer tension — fed into this reinforcing cycle that’s been dragging Nike down.

And speaking of things hurting Nike…We can’t ignore the most recent development — the one that crushed the stock by 15%, only for it to bounce right back a few days later. You probably know what I’m talking about: Tariff mania.



**The Impact of Tariffs on Nike**

The U.S. recently announced a new round of tariffs on imports from Vietnam — a country where Nike now produces over 50% of its footwear and nearly 30% of its apparel.

Depending on how Nike responds — whether by absorbing the cost, passing it on to consumers, or renegotiating with suppliers — the impact could vary widely. But in all scenarios, there’s potential for weakened demand and further pressure on margins.

There are no precise estimates yet on how Nike’s financials might be affected. Some industry experts suggest shoes that currently retail for $150 could rise to $220–$230, a range that likely assumes the full cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers.

But in reality, that may not be feasible. Pushing prices that high risks damaging demand, especially in an already soft consumer environment. On the other hand, if Nike absorbs the cost, margins would take a substantial hit. Each option comes with trade-offs, and none of them are easy.

For now, the situation remains uncertain. Reciprocal tariffs from Vietnam have been paused for 90 days, and initial talks between the U.S. and Vietnam have already taken place. But until there’s more clarity, the uncertainty remains yet another headwind for a business already in reset mode.



**Valuing the Swoosh**

We’ve now covered Nike’s strengths — and its many current challenges: declining sales, margin pressure, inventory cleanup, and a strategy reset that will take time. So, when it comes to valuation, I try to reflect all of that — while knowing full well that the more precise a model tries to be, the more likely it is to be wrong.

Still, here’s the thinking behind my assumptions.

Before the recent tariff announcements, Q4 was already expected to be the low point, with management guiding for mid-teen revenue declines and another 450 basis point drop in gross margin. Now, with added uncertainty from the tariff situation, I remain cautious even beyond that.

For fiscal 2025, I assume a 15% revenue decline and an operating margin of 6.5% — down 5.5 points from 2024 and the lowest in over a decade.

Before reciprocal tariffs were announced, I assumed a gradual recovery: 5% revenue growth and a 10.5% margin by 2030. Even under those more optimistic assumptions, Nike would have only returned to its 2024 earnings by the end of the decade.

Given everything that’s changed, I’ve now revised those numbers: Just 2% annual revenue growth and a 2030 operating margin of 9%. That would mean that, even five years out, operating margins would be lower than at any point in the last decade, except for 8.3% in 2020 when the Covid pandemic hit.

From there, I total Nike’s expected earnings per share and dividends, apply a range of exit multiples, and assign probabilities to reflect different long-term scenarios. No one knows what multiple investors will pay five years from now, but this gives some structure to that uncertainty.

Discounted back at 8%, the model suggests a fair value of $63 per share — roughly 16.5% above today’s price of $54.

Don’t focus too much on the precise numbers here. For me, the key takeaway is that even if I assume a very grim outlook for the next five years, Nike’s current price seems attractive. Considering the dividend and the buybacks, your total shareholder return, depending on the exit multiple, could look like this (historic P/E between 25-28):

Yes, the outlook is cloudy. Yes, more tariff headlines could push the stock lower. But from a long-term perspective, this entry point looks increasingly attractive. 

The bottom line: if you still believe in Nike’s brand, scale, and staying power, the stock offers solid upside from here (i.e., low-to-mid double-digit expected returns annually with very cautious assumptions, looking out 5 years or so)— especially if the turnaround gains traction and the tariffs end up as negotiating leverage, not a long-term policy.

* Net income: $5.7 billion, up about 12.43% from the previous year.

Recently, Nike has faced challenges such as new U.S. tariffs impacting revenues from key markets like China (17% decline). They are also managing high inventory levels through significant discounting, potentially affecting profit margins and brand perception. Additionally, under their new CEO, Elliott Hill, Nike is shifting focus towards premium products and strengthening retail partnerships.

Analysts seem mixed, with some downgrading Nike's stock due to uncertainties around their turnaround strategy.

I'm interested in hearing from others: Do you view Nike as a good value investment at current levels? What do you think of their approach to overcoming these challenges, and what risks or opportunities should investors keep in mind?

Perhaps the first signal of just how far Bowerman and Knight were willing to go to build the best running shoes in the world — and the Moon Shoe became their first true breakthrough.

From there, Nike’s innovation streak took off: the Waffle Trainer, Air cushioning in the Tailwind, and later the futuristic Nike Shox, made famous by Vince Carter’s Olympic dunk over a 7'2"" Frenchman in 2000.



**The Best Deal in Sports History**

While Nike’s early models laid the foundation for its reputation in performance and innovation, what truly catapulted the company into global dominance was arguably the greatest marketing move in sports history.

In October 1984, Nike signed a young, promising rookie named Michael Jordan. It wasn’t an easy deal — Jordan had his heart set on Adidas, but they weren’t focused on basketball then. Nike saw the opportunity and took a bold swing.

They offered him a five-year, $2.5 million contract, which, at the time, was basically their entire marketing budget, and built an entire brand around him. The goal was to sell $1 million worth of Air Jordans in the first year.

Instead, they sold $126 million.

That single bet didn’t just change Nike’s trajectory — it redefined how athletes, brands, and marketing would work for decades to come.



**The Landscape is Changing**

For a long time, there were two dominant players in the global footwear and apparel industry: Nike and Adidas. And yes — both still lead the pack. But the momentum has shifted, and lately, it hasn’t been in Nike’s favor.

In the U.S. market, Adidas has grown its share from 6% to 11% over the last decade, while Nike’s share has stagnated. At the same time, a new trend has emerged: smaller, performance-focused brands are entering the market and gaining serious traction. Two of the most talked-about in recent years are the Swiss brand On and the French brand Hoka.

Before we dig into the impact these rising players have had — and Nike’s loss of global market share — it’s worth asking: How did we get here?

Like most major shifts, it’s not monocausal. A handful of factors played a role. But in Nike’s case, there’s a particularly clear catalyst: the company’s DTC pivot under former CEO John Donahoe — a strategy that, in hindsight, didn’t play out the way investors had hoped.

Nike originally built its dominance through wholesale. For years, it was the undisputed leader in almost every major shoe retailer. But if you look at the 2024 numbers, Nike’s wholesale-to-DTC ratio is now only slightly tilted in favor of wholesale — a big shift from how the business used to operate.

That change began in 2017, when Nike made a strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer. Under then-CEO Mark Parker, Nike’s digital business took off. In 2014, online sales totaled just over $1 billion. Five years later, that number had grown fivefold.

The direction seemed clear: Nike would leverage its brand power by focusing more on DTC, especially through digital channels.

And then came what looked like a perfect fit. Just a few years earlier, John Donahoe had joined Nike’s board. With experience as CEO of eBay and ServiceNow, and as Chairman of the Board at PayPal, he brought deep digital expertise. So when Parker stepped down, Donahoe — the tech operator — was tapped to lead Nike into its next phase: a digital-first future.

Before Donahoe, Nike had only three CEOs. First, the founder, Phil Knight. Then William Perez, Nike’s first external hire, and finally, Mark Parker, who came up through the company and led for over 13 years. Perez, on the other hand, lasted just two. He left after being deemed “not a good cultural fit.”

At Nike, culture matters. It’s a fuzzy term — one that’s often used as corporate filler. I’m the first to roll my eyes when someone brings up “culture” in a boardroom pitch. But there’s a difference between talking about culture and living it — and Nike has always lived it. You see it in the stories, the athlete relationships, and the leadership style. More on that later when we talk about Elliott Hill, Nike’s new CEO.

*(Just a quick note, I share stock breakdowns like this weekly, with charts and downloadable valuation models, in free emails — subscribe* [*here*](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Reddit) *if that interests you.)*

The problem Nike had with Perez came back with Donahoe. Despite years on the board, he never quite embodied the Nike way. He led like a consultant, which isn’t all that surprising given his background. Before eBay and ServiceNow, Donahoe spent 20 years at Bain & Company, one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world, eventually becoming CEO and President.

Still, despite the cultural mismatch, Donahoe’s first year as CEO looked like a success. Nike quickly doubled online revenue, surpassing $10 billion in digital sales. The pandemic certainly helped — stores were closed, and running became a go-to hobby when it was one of the few things people could still do outdoors.

It was around this time that Donahoe said what’s now become an almost iconic quote: “The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back.”

Well… the consumer did revert back.

People were eager to get out again and experience shopping in person. And honestly, I get it. Call me old-school, but I’ve never really understood how people buy shoes online. I need to try them on, walk a few steps. If I ordered without trying them, I’d be sending 90% of them back.

But let’s get back to Nike’s problem. A major part of the DTC strategy was cutting ties with wholesalers — including Foot Locker, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and many others. The idea was to drive more traffic through Nike’s own channels. But that came at a cost.

Just Foot Locker and Dick’s alone have around five times as many stores as Nike does across the U.S. Cutting those partnerships meant walking away from shelf space — and from millions of eyeballs, free marketing, and the impulse purchases that come with it.

Naturally, a lot of shoppers didn’t head straight to Nike stores — they went to wholesalers. Many of them probably still wanted to buy Nike shoes. And historically, they could. Nike was the No. 1 brand in almost every major retailer. In 2020, 75% of Foot Locker’s inventory comprised Nike and Jordan products.

That changed quickly.

After Nike decided to scale back wholesale partnerships, Foot Locker’s Nike allocation dropped by more than 20%. Other retailers saw even steeper declines. The move hurt both sides — retailers lost a key traffic driver, and the abrupt decision caused many to lose trust in Nike.

And when Nike realized it had overestimated its brand pull, it was already in a tough spot. Consumers weren’t walking out of Foot Locker empty-handed and heading to the nearest Nike store — they were just buying something else. The shelves were filled with other brands, and to the retailers’ surprise, those brands sold just fine.

So when Nike tried to return, it no longer had the same leverage. Retailers didn’t feel the urgency to bring Nike back at the same volume — or on the same terms.

And that opened the door for a new wave of brands like On and Hoka. Both were founded by athletes, both offered innovative technology, and both captured consumer excitement, especially among runners and performance-focused shoppers.

Which leads us to Nike’s second big mistake during its DTC push: It neglected the product.



**The Decline of Nike Shoes**

I’ve mentioned how Nike used to be an innovation machine. In its early days, product came first — and Nike made sure that mindset stayed at the core of the company. That’s what culture meant at Nike: being product-obsessed, hungry to win, and always pushing new ideas forward.

But in recent years, Nike has lost that edge. There haven’t been many groundbreaking innovations. Sure, there have been announcements — but not much to back them up.

So what happened?

As the company focused on building out its online presence, the product took a back seat. Resources were reallocated, and the goal quietly shifted — from making the best shoes to making more shoes, in order to drive DTC volume and hit digital growth targets.

That’s why we got wave after wave of Air Max and Air Jordan re-releases in every colorway imaginable — instead of truly new technology. And to be clear: I like those shoes. A lot of people do. But when you flood the market with them, they start to lose their appeal.

For years, Nike struck the perfect balance — selling at scale while still keeping sneakerheads engaged through scarcity, excitement, and originality. But as the product strategy leaned too far into mass availability, that balance began to slip—and with it, demand.

Under Donahoe, the balance tipped further toward the volume game, while Nike drifted away from speaking to sneaker culture — the very community that helped build its brand. And look, it would be easy to pin all of this on Donahoe. But that wouldn’t be fair — or true.

Nike’s size alone makes it incredibly hard to tailor products to every consumer. Smaller brands like On and Hoka are naturally more agile and can move faster in terms of both design and messaging.

But here’s the thing: Nike has always had that disadvantage. Long before Donahoe ever became CEO. Something else changed.

What changed was how Nike approached its customers.

Historically, Nike thrived in what’s called a pull market — where you first create a product, and then create demand for it. And Nike mastered this model for two key reasons:

First, it was relentlessly product-focused. The innovation was there. The designs were there. Nike shoes didn’t just look good — they performed. In 2019, Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first human to run a marathon distance in under two hours. The controversy? His Nike Vaporfly shoe. Designed so well, it was rumored to have a material impact on the runner’s time. World Athletics even banned the shoe from subsequent races.

Second, Nike had — and still has — the most powerful athlete portfolio in the world. From Michael Jordan to Serena Williams, LeBron James to Cristiano Ronaldo — no brand has paired product with star power as effectively as Nike.

I know firsthand how powerful Nike’s pull factor used to be. As a kid, I didn’t just want football shoes — I wanted the exact pair my favorite player wore. Nothing else mattered. The same goes for kids who idolize basketball players, tennis stars, golfers, or even celebrities. Nike made it easy to create demand because when you combined that emotional connection with a high-quality product, Nike was unbeatable.

But in recent years, that model started to break down. As Nike shifted away from its product-first mindset, it also moved away from operating in a pull market. Instead, it started behaving like a typical push brand — trying to predict what consumers wanted and then building products to match.

That approach doesn’t work for Nike.

They’re too big, too slow, and frankly, too far removed from niche consumer trends to play that game well. And more importantly, they’ve historically had an edge most brands could only dream of: the ability to shape taste, not follow it.

But once Nike realized it couldn’t reliably guess what consumers wanted, it made a familiar move — it doubled down on its legacy models. As I mentioned earlier, that’s how we ended up with a flood of Jordans and Air Maxes in every color combination imaginable.



**Reviving Nike — Win Now!**

Last October, a new chapter began at Nike. Elliott Hill returned to the company — this time as CEO — after working his way up through Nike’s ranks from 1988 to 2020. He started as an intern. When he left, he was the President of Consumer and Marketplace.

Hill understands and embodies Nike like few others. For perspective, when he joined in 1988, Nike’s market cap was around $700 million. Today, Nike generates that much in revenue every five days.

Since returning, Hill has wasted no time. He launched what he calls the Win Now strategy — a plan to get Nike back on track by doing what it once did best: focusing on product, rebuilding retail relationships, partnering closely with athletes, and returning to a pull market model.

The shift is already showing up in bold marketing moves. Nike just ran its first Super Bowl ad since 1998, spending $16 million on the campaign. They signed Caitlin Clark, the biggest name in women’s basketball, to a $28 million deal. And — this one hits especially close to home — they signed a $700 million sponsorship deal with the German national football team, ending a 70-year partnership with Adidas.

Beyond bold marketing moves, Hill is also shifting focus away from the volume game that defined Donahoe’s DTC strategy. His goal is to re-establish Nike Direct as a premium destination — not just a high-traffic sales channel. He’s been clear: Nike became too promotional in recent years.

Now, Nike isn’t a luxury brand, but it has always carried a premium image. And if you read our Moncler newsletter, you’ll remember why excessive discounting can damage that kind of brand equity.

It didn’t just hurt Nike’s image — it hurt retailers, too. Whenever Nike slashed prices, retailers were forced to follow suit just to stay competitive. That strained relationships and further complicated Nike’s wholesale reset.

But that chapter’s behind them — at least in intention. Since taking over, Hill has been on the road nonstop, visiting wholesalers, Nike factories, and athletes around the world. His message? “We have to earn our way back to the shelves.”

But that was October. So now the big question is: How’s the “Win Now” strategy going?

**Recent Results — Win Later?**

Well, there’s not much that suggests Nike is “winning now” — at least if you’re looking strictly at the numbers.

In the most recent quarter, sales declined 9% overall, with drops across every brand, region, and sales channel. Gross margin took a heavy hit, falling 330 basis points (3.3 percentage points) to 41.5%. And if you looked at the EPS and thought, “Well, that’s not that bad,” keep in mind: it was propped up by a 10% drop in the effective tax rate — a one-off that helped polish otherwise rough results.

So, why is Elliott Hill’s confidence “reinforced”? Why does he say Nike is on “the right path”? Is he seeing different numbers than the rest of us?

I don’t think so. And believe it or not, I actually don’t dislike the recent trends as much as the headlines suggest.

Yes — the results are not good. And they’re even going to get worse. Nike’s guidance for Q4 includes mid-teen revenue declines and a 5% drop in gross margins.

But here’s the thing: the Win Now strategy was never meant to deliver short-term wins. Hill made that clear from the beginning. He said his plan would hurt the numbers in the short run, but he’s taking the long-term view. I know, calling it “Win Now” is a bit of a lie then. But honestly, would you call your strategy “Win Later?”

One of Hill’s first major tasks was reducing Nike’s inventory problem. After pandemic-era supply shocks eased, a flood of delayed product hit Nike all at once, leaving them with several seasons’ worth of inventory. Fixing that was going to hurt. But it was necessary.

Retail brands like Nike suffer tremendously when inventory levels get out of control. It clogs up the cash flow statement — you’ve already spent the money to make the product, but you're not getting paid because it’s just sitting there. The longer it sits, the more working capital is tied up and the higher the carrying costs.

But clearing that inventory also comes at a cost. You have to discount heavily to move product quickly, which not only hurts margins but also dilutes the brand and strains retailer relationships.

Hopefully, by now, you can see how everything we’ve discussed — from the DTC pivot to product missteps and retailer tension — fed into this reinforcing cycle that’s been dragging Nike down.

And speaking of things hurting Nike…We can’t ignore the most recent development — the one that crushed the stock by 15%, only for it to bounce right back a few days later. You probably know what I’m talking about: Tariff mania.



**The Impact of Tariffs on Nike**

The U.S. recently announced a new round of tariffs on imports from Vietnam — a country where Nike now produces over 50% of its footwear and nearly 30% of its apparel.

Depending on how Nike responds — whether by absorbing the cost, passing it on to consumers, or renegotiating with suppliers — the impact could vary widely. But in all scenarios, there’s potential for weakened demand and further pressure on margins.

There are no precise estimates yet on how Nike’s financials might be affected. Some industry experts suggest shoes that currently retail for $150 could rise to $220–$230, a range that likely assumes the full cost of tariffs is passed on to consumers.

But in reality, that may not be feasible. Pushing prices that high risks damaging demand, especially in an already soft consumer environment. On the other hand, if Nike absorbs the cost, margins would take a substantial hit. Each option comes with trade-offs, and none of them are easy.

For now, the situation remains uncertain. Reciprocal tariffs from Vietnam have been paused for 90 days, and initial talks between the U.S. and Vietnam have already taken place. But until there’s more clarity, the uncertainty remains yet another headwind for a business already in reset mode.



**Valuing the Swoosh**

We’ve now covered Nike’s strengths — and its many current challenges: declining sales, margin pressure, inventory cleanup, and a strategy reset that will take time. So, when it comes to valuation, I try to reflect all of that — while knowing full well that the more precise a model tries to be, the more likely it is to be wrong.

Still, here’s the thinking behind my assumptions.

Before the recent tariff announcements, Q4 was already expected to be the low point, with management guiding for mid-teen revenue declines and another 450 basis point drop in gross margin. Now, with added uncertainty from the tariff situation, I remain cautious even beyond that.

For fiscal 2025, I assume a 15% revenue decline and an operating margin of 6.5% — down 5.5 points from 2024 and the lowest in over a decade.

Before reciprocal tariffs were announced, I assumed a gradual recovery: 5% revenue growth and a 10.5% margin by 2030. Even under those more optimistic assumptions, Nike would have only returned to its 2024 earnings by the end of the decade.

Given everything that’s changed, I’ve now revised those numbers: Just 2% annual revenue growth and a 2030 operating margin of 9%. That would mean that, even five years out, operating margins would be lower than at any point in the last decade, except for 8.3% in 2020 when the Covid pandemic hit.

From there, I total Nike’s expected earnings per share and dividends, apply a range of exit multiples, and assign probabilities to reflect different long-term scenarios. No one knows what multiple investors will pay five years from now, but this gives some structure to that uncertainty.

Discounted back at 8%, the model suggests a fair value of $63 per share — roughly 16.5% above today’s price of $54.

Don’t focus too much on the precise numbers here. For me, the key takeaway is that even if I assume a very grim outlook for the next five years, Nike’s current price seems attractive. Considering the dividend and the buybacks, your total shareholder return, depending on the exit multiple, could look like this (historic P/E between 25-28):

Yes, the outlook is cloudy. Yes, more tariff headlines could push the stock lower. But from a long-term perspective, this entry point looks increasingly attractive. 

The bottom line: if you still believe in Nike’s brand, scale, and staying power, the stock offers solid upside from here (i.e., low-to-mid double-digit expected returns annually with very cautious assumptions, looking out 5 years or so)— especially if the turnaround gains traction and the tariffs end up as negotiating leverage, not a long-term policy.

Why?

2/ $NKE's revenue fell 9% year-to-date.

Gross profits down 16%.

Earnings down 30%.

That’s a clear sign: they’re losing market share and margins are shrinking.

3/ The company misjudged consumer trends, leading to heavy discounting and excess inventory.

They’ve now changed leadership and are trying to stabilize operations.

4/ Despite weak performance, they’re still:

* Raising the dividend
* Buying back shares

Some investors see this as the wrong signal in a turnaround phase.

5/ The losses aren’t isolated to one region.

Sales are down across the board:

* North America: -9%
* Europe: -11%
* China: -17%
* LATAM & APAC: -12%

Even Converse is down 18%.

6/ Competitors are taking share:

* $ONON: premium growth brand
* $SKX: growing fast at a cheaper price
* $DECK: Hoka running shoes up 24%

Nike’s appeal is slipping.

7/ Nike’s response?

* New marketing (first Super Bowl ad in 27 years)
* New running shoes (Pegasus Premium)
* Partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims

Trying to recapture attention + culture.

8/ Bulls are betting on brand durability.

Nike still has global recognition and athlete sponsorships.

But growth needs to return — fast.

9/ Valuation?

At \~$100B market cap, this isn’t deep value.

It still trades at a premium multiple compared to brands like $CROX.

Wall Street expects a rebound.

10/ If $NKE grows 5–10% per year and stabilizes margins, you could double your money over time.

But if turnaround fails, downside risk remains.

11/ Not an easy bet. It’s a turnaround story.

Big funds are buying on the belief the brand will bounce back.

1jinjsz_NKE,NKE,Nike has now hit its COVID lows,"I've been analyzing Nike (NKE) at its current COVID-era price point of $67.9, revealing several intriguing investment dynamics that warrant examination. Despite delivering an EPS beat of 0.54, revenue trajectories indicate strategic recalibration rather than organic growth, with management characterizing this as a deliberate reset to optimize product focus and operational efficiency.

* Revenue expansion: FY 2024 revenue reached $51.36B, up substantially from $36.4B in 2018 (last comparable price point)
* Liability exposure increased from $3.46B to $12B, predominantly structured at favorable 2.5% coupon rates
* Capital allocation: Share count reduction from 1.6B to 1.48B through systematic repurchases
* Forward guidance: Management projects normalization by 2027, with intermediate focus on inventory optimization

Valuation analysis from Value Sense (https://valuesense.io/ticker/nke) indicates potential misalignment between price and fundamentals:

* DCF Value: $53.7
* Relative Value: $31.8
* Growth Expectations: Reverse DCF implies 3.5% FCF growth rate

Competition:

* Emergent challengers (Hoka, On, etc.) rapidly securing market share
* Diminishing brand loyalty among younger consumer cohorts
* Product integrity - Perceived quality deterioration despite maintained/elevated price points
* Vulnerability to competitors offering superior materials at comparable thresholds

Current pricing may not represent optimal value despite significant pullback.

1iti22w_NKE,NKE,Thoughts on Nike($NKE)?,"With their new CEO coming in last October, Elliott Hill, and the new collaboration with Kim K's ""Skims,"" I am feeling bullish on this stock when I have never had before?|

Since its heights in 2020, and admittedly some years before, I have always been bearish on Nike thinking they were an old guard fashion company that would slowly deteriote as new kings(Lulu, Aldo) rise. 

But with their new CEO being Elliott Hill, someone who started at the company over 25 years ago as an intern and quite literally worked his way to the top(look at his LinkedIn, he climbed from position to position in Nike), idk why but to me its promising. This is someone who worked in so many different positions and departments in Nike, who kept getting promotions, to me that shows he knows his shit, is good at it, works hard at it.

On top of that, with the Kim K collaboration, I think this could be a sign of Nike really trying to take back the high quality gymwear market while still having shoes, while still having sports, while still having a cheaper market with their outlet stores. 

But this is not really my space. I know more in tech. I know more in the gaming industry. I've hit big with Nintendo's 2017-->2020s run, T-Mobile, recently Palantir, but I rarely own fashion stocks. Wanted to gage this sub's thoughts.",2025-02-19,10,46

1im1cux_NKE,NKE,NKE Potential High Reward Setup with full analysis and position.,"**MONDAY UPDATE**: Monday closed at day high, above Friday's high, block trades shows institutional support the battle of 70 has clearly established it as strong accumulation support, this should gap up nicely tmr as analysts identify the trade blocks and feel more confident of entering position; could rally 2 days in a row, if we hit 74 tmr, id expect a squeeze to around 77-78, that will probably be my exit.

Position update, the 1200 calls gone up by 25% or about 20k unrealized gain, i will hold it through for a 10 bagger, also added 500 calls for this friday at 73 strike for 0.24, may exit this on Wednesday or a second impulse move regardless if it hits 78 price target or not; il be happy with hitting 75 which is the POC for the past few months.

**TUESDAY UPDATE:** right on cue we had battle of 71.5 today, bullish price action is very nice, typical consolidation, stop loss should be adjusted to 70 ish, tmr is very crucial as now the price retraced back to value low, if Wednesday we see strong volume heading back into the 72-78 range, we are in play for a surge as traders now have confirmation last friday's sell off is over reaction; the main target is 75 where POC lies, depending on if we see a strong squeeze, this will be a good level to exit, otherwise scale out between 76, 77 and 78 for this week; if the test low establishes a clear floor, this could be the rally that propels nike to 82 in couple of weeks where the daily 200EMA sits at.

**WEDNESDAY UPDATE:** very strong bullish price action, consolidation at 72.5 which is the 30-min 200EMA, the short sellers came in 72.25 with large blocks, but got bought up easy, set up looking good for momentum traders to join in, tmr should be a nice gap up, as we have fully invalidated last friday's selloff, so the quick sell off range last thursday should have very little resistance, the move could be quick. Taking half of the table at gap up, likely targeting 75 for a 10 bagger, then at 77 is my best case scenario to fully exit weekly calls.

**THURSDAY UPDATE:** hoping to see a break of 73 overnight but it didnt happen, sold at open for 0.65 at 73 first short entry, cost basis 0.21, nice little 300% gain, bought in again for 0.2 at pull back to 15 minute 200EMA, held same amount of original position with 200% profit taken and saved; sold all at the end for 0.8 for another 400% gain; in total ended the day with a 7 bagger; keeping next week's 50k 74C position acquired last friday over the weekend currently at 155k, with 77-78 price target this thing will return 500k; using 30% of winning from weekly calls bought 25k worth of 73 put at 0.3 for risk adjustment as are at a crossroad of 1hr resistance, gonna end the day early and shower. Added more lotto calls at 75 and 76 small positions.

**FRIDAY UPDATE:** sold 73 puts at opening hours for 0.65 that bought for 0.3, did not take new positions for the rest of the day, as again we did not break the resistance overnight, so yesterday's high is the ranging target, seems like this week the market wants to stay building tension. Target for next week is 76.5 and 77.8, 73 should now be the floor and bullish pattern is intact.

**NEXT MONDAY UPDATE:** we have breakout with index and relative strength with Dow very nice, took 50% profit for 10 bagger, now its lotto time, bought 150 puts for intraday hedge, out for 3k profit, the action is strong (will post position screenshot if people actually wants proof). Signing off early to take the wife out, good profit for 2 weeks work, some buddies jumped on the ship, it was good ride, good luck to you all.

**NEXT MONDAY UPDATE 2**: Hit my price target, out of the positions for a nice little 500k gain. Bought protective puts to hedge (i also have long NKE positions), this week max pain is between 73 and 75, slight pullback is possible as we are near 1.5 SD of VWAP for multiple key time frames. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I believe NKE currently presents a wonderful potentially 10 bagger opportunity with a high likelihood of seeing a short squeeze in the coming weeks; we could see the price go to 82 from 68 (extreme case), which is a 20% gain on stock.

**- (Neutral Signal) Volume Profile Analysis:** currently we have a break below the 6 months volume profile value low, in English this means we had a breakout to the downside; as you may know, most breakouts fail and lead to strong reversals (ie. bull/bear traps). so now we should be asking ""hmmm does this feel like a true breakout?"" Nevertheless the breakdown means major funds will be alerted as most funds have protocols on alerts of new lows, so more eyes are now assessing the situation and readying to play.

**- (Neutral Signal) Extreme Volume:** the volume on Friday is comparable to earnings volume, which is almost 3 times the average volume; this is quite significant, the likely explanation is that since the price made new low, it triggers many natural stop losses for the entirety of the last 6 months. This effectively has shaken out near all ""weak hands"" in the entire range. The abnormal volume could signal capitulation and selling climax (see section on darkpool orders for whether the selling is controlled or panic).

**- (Buying Signal) Dark Pool Accumulation:** go to 5 seconds time frame if you can, and inspect the order blocks during the day and especially near close, you will see huge blocks at 69.50 69.00 68.70, perfect whole numbers of large size typically signal dark pool blocks, the planned manner with a tightening range is a classic bottom fishing behaviour, it generally means that the buy side is taking advantage of the extreme selling by ""letting the price to come to them"" in a controlled way.

**- (Buying Signal) VWAP:** price settled nicely on Friday right on -2 SD VWAP (6-months anchor from the June 2024 quarter), which is a classic technical level for mean reversion players to enter.

**- (Buying Signal) RSI:** 1-hr and 4 hr RSI are at extremely oversold levels, this coupled with -2 SD VWAP shows a powerful signal for buying.

https://preview.redd.it/u7ezp41gt9ie1.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a64d6e49b7e6b18e728e10618f78346b726cb62

**- (Buying Signal) Clean Technical Low:** the price broke below 6-months low, actually it broke 5 year low as it is only higher than the covid panic crash; at this new low, it provides an intuitive an natural area for short sellers to cover. This along with the fact that the price is at -2 SD VWAP, means we have a confluence of buying interest from mean aversion long traders, value investors, and short seller covers.

https://preview.redd.it/45kh0e5ht9ie1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c0b96c38739f8c6eae5652650a509b6b533ef7

\- (Buying Signal) Put/Call Interest: the put call interest for next week has a singular peak at 70 strike, and the ratio is 20 to 1, this is HIGHLY significant as naturally the 70 is the nice and clean floor for the range and put sellers understandable congregate at that level. As the price drops near 70, the short put will be increasing in value, and the put seller option makers will delta hedge by shorting the stock, at 70 these put sellers will have effectively completed there delta hedge, so they will no longer be compelled to do more selling (you should paste this to an AI chatbot for clarification as it can explain the concept in detail). The put sellers will not wish to sell the stock even lower as that would mean there puts will be exercised and they would rather the put be expired worthless.

If you inspect the price action on Friday, it is clear that the selling pressure sits EXACTLY at 70 (ie. where the buying attempts failed and the selling pressure brought the price down to 68.6).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. Analysis on Trader Category & Trade Psychology

This section outlines the expected psychology and positioning of the major players in the market.

\- Institutional Players: Clean technical level, alerted of the new low and is aware of the nice -2 SD value area. Could be instructed to rebalance or rotate over the weekend. The technical indicators support oversold status on multiple time frames.

\- Value / Long Term Investor: the new low provides a natural place to average down for players who have more tolerance for volatility and longer time horizon.

\- Hedge Fund / Option Makers: Put sellers have finished the delta hedge, and no need to short the stock more since it is below 70; if the price rises, these put sellers will have to cover their hedge position by buying the stock back. This accelerates as we break 70 and above.

\- Short Sellers: the new low provides a natural place to cover the short positions without feeling like you missed out; short sellers also compete with each other who can close the position at the best price, as being late means you have to cover high.

\- Retail: most likely their stop losses have been taken out by the breakdown, and now they have forced capitulation. This means selling pressure has been reduced dramatically. Many people are waiting for 65, but the interest at this level is simply too obvious, and the market may have no interesting in letting the obvious deals occur. It could as well bottom at 68, and reverse, leading to FOMO of those prospect longs to buy back higher.

**All in all, we have the possibility of an interesting confluence of multiple parties nearly all aligned for ""Buying"" - this means strong and quick moves to the upside.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4. Prediction

First few days next week we will likely see:

\- Battle of 69 & 70: the buy side is setting a controlled bottom at 69, the initial sellers at 70 are ""option makers"" who are not yet completed delta hedging their short put; if 70 is breached and holds, then those put sellers switches from sell side to buy side, as now they must cover their short positions. We Could see in the open a quick test of 69 as the support, if it is brough up, we will test 70.

\- Battle of 71.5: this is the volume profile value low, if the resistance is strong and LOTS of sellers jump in, this actually validates the breakdown, as the old range is rejected; so this will likely be the first major hurdle. If this breaks then we likely see a retracement from 72.5 (-1 SD VWAP) to 71.5, if 71.5 becomes support, then we likely go straight to the POC at 75 with little resistance.

\- Gap to 75: the above situations might occur on monday or tuesday, then if all goes well 75 could be a nice place to gap up to overnight, then the spring is loaded and we move quick to VWAP at 77.5, potentially overshooting to 78.

\- Consolidation at 78: this is the first level where profit takers should emerge, could be a nice place to take short term positions off the table.

\- Burst to 81-82: It is also possible for the spring move to send the price to the +1 SD VWAP level, which incidentally is also the 200-day EMA, this provides a super natural resistance and a great place to profit take all the position.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Gameplan

\- If you enter below 70, set your stop loss at 68, and watch 70 and 71.5 closely. The price should bounce between 69 and 71.5 as the battle plays out, if 71.5 is breached, move your stop loss to 70. Now you are in guaranteed profit.

\- If you enter later, set your entry near 71.5 after the successful breach, the price should retest that level to validate the fact that the volume profile range is still in play, set your stop loss at 70.

\- If we have breached 71.5 then a reversal is almost inevitable as the shorts on Friday are absolutely trapped and shorts from 78 to 72 are getting nervous, and potentially looking to cover. Now you should be considering exit strategies at 75, 78 and 81.

\- For call buyers i recommend buying some 74C expiring in 2-3 weeks, as most short squeezes complete in 4-10 trading days. You could also consider buy weekly put at 70 when the price tests 71.5 as a hedge for continued breakdown.

\- If all goes well, your 74C could be netting 5 to 10 to 20 times return (depending on the degree of the squeeze).

I hope someone finds this post interesting, good luck boy!

1i6iq82_NKE,NKE,NKE - thoughts at current values,"Just saw that Nike ($NKE) is trading at around $70.84, which is pretty close to its 52-week low. With all the ups and downs, I'm wondering if now's the time to invest in this iconic brand. 

Here's the lowdown:

- Price: Currently in the low $70s.
- Analysts: They're saying it could go up to $86.25 in the next year, which is a nice 21.75% potential upside.

But there's some baggage:
- Sales have been kinda meh in North America and China.
- New competition like On and Hoka are stealing some thunder.
- Innovation seems to be lagging - where's the next big thing from Nike?

On the bright side:
- Nike's brand is still huge. It's not like they're going anywhere.
- They've got a new CEO and are focusing back on sports and wholesale - could be good signs.
- Plus, they pay dividends and do buybacks, which is nice for us shareholders.

1hvpzvd_NET,NET,NKE stock analysis - wonderful business at fair price ,"Strongly believe NKE is a strong pick right now. 

The company is still market leader and new management is addressing previous mistakes and correcting. Since 2021 Nike cut relationship with retailers leaving competitors shelf space, abandoned its place in the Sports category which is growing doubled digits, over supplied the market with its classical losing its fashion and premium position among consumers for ever loved models such as AF1, Jordan 1 and dunks. Overall the company became a bit too promotional.


The new management run by industry veteran Elliot Hill has addressed the misstep Nike took and is already putting on a strategy to restore Nike’s identity - the company is working on re establishing relationships with retailers, pushing their presence in the Sports category and cutting production of the brand’s classics. 

While these moves may be painful on a short term horizon I believe they are necessary to restore long term value and avoid Nike looses its dominant positions as the best footwear company in the world. 

NKE trades at 22 P.E but that’s in line with competitor and on the lower side and no other companies in footwear has same budget capacity and consumer resonance has Nike. The company has a fair net cash position and with fairly conservative assumptions I estimate a safe margin of safety around 15%  based on both a DCF and trading comps.

I believe there is a compelling case for Nike to surpass $100 in the near future, presenting a significant growth opportunity. Here’s my reasoning—feel free to share your thoughts.

 

1. Return of the Original Nike Veteran – Eliot Hill as CEO (October 2024)

Eliot Hill, who took over as CEO in October 2024, is a true Nike veteran with over 30 years of experience. He first joined the company as an intern in 1988 and held various roles before retiring in 2020. During his tenure, Hill served in key positions such as Head of Sales, Director of Team Sports, and General Manager of North America, making substantial contributions to Nike's growth. Just before his retirement, he was the President of Consumer and Marketplace Operations for both Nike and the Jordan brand, leading marketing and sales strategies.

Hill’s deep understanding of Nike and its core business makes him well-positioned to steer the company back to its roots. His comeback signals a return to the original Nike strategy, which I’ll elaborate on below.

 

2. Addressing Key Failures and Strategic Shifts

During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Hill identified two major reasons for Nike's recent struggles and outlined corrective measures:

First, Nike's focus on direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales and digital channels came at the expense of its wholesale partners, such as Foot Locker, resulting in reduced shelf space in key retail stores. Hill, who maintained strong relationships with these partners during his previous tenure, announced that Nike has already begun efforts to rebuild and strengthen those partnerships. By regaining prime retail display space, Nike is poised to restore its market presence.

Second, an over-reliance on existing product lines led to oversupply and a heavy dependence on promotions. Hill emphasized plans to reduce promotional activity and prioritize innovation by reviving fresh, cutting-edge product lineups, which should enhance Nike’s competitive edge.

 

3. Historically Low Valuation

Nike’s current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 22, which is a 40% discount compared to its 5-year average. If Nike successfully executes its turnaround plan, it’s reasonable to expect a re-rating, potentially allowing the stock to enjoy a premium valuation once again.

Additionally, Nike offers a stable dividend yield of 2.14%, having increased its dividend payouts by 186% over the past decade. This stability, combined with Nike's share repurchase of $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2024, adds further value for shareholders and instills confidence in the investment.

 

4. Unrivaled Brand Strength

According to Euromonitor, Nike leads the global sportswear market with a 16.4% share, far ahead of Adidas, which holds 9%. Despite recent criticisms and headwinds, Nike’s brand remains a formidable asset, demonstrating resilience. Once a strong brand is established, it’s difficult to break. With the company refocusing on its core strengths, I believe it can regain its former momentum and instill trust in its future.

 

Conclusion

Nike’s path forward hinges on returning to its core strategies under the leadership of Eliot Hill. While I estimate that it will take 1–2 years for these changes to fully materialize, stock prices often move in anticipation of future developments. Therefore, I believe that gradually accumulating Nike shares ahead of this turnaround could yield strong returns.

# Nike's Earnings Reveal — CEO Hill's Plan to Fix the Swoosh

Nike CEO Elliott Hill has laced up and hit the ground running. Tasked with undoing years of overproduction and poor strategy, Hill is steering the world’s largest sportswear brand back toward its sporty roots—but don’t expect quick wins.

**Hitting Reset**  
  
Hill’s strategy is clear: scale back on mass-market shoes like Dunks and Air Force 1s, which have lost their cachet, and refocus on performance sports gear. That shift comes with a cost. Last quarter, revenue fell 8% to $12.35 billion, while profits dropped to $1.16 billion. Expect an even steeper decline next quarter as Nike clears excess inventory to restore some exclusivity.

The goal? Create more demand than supply—a classic Nike move that hasn’t been executed well lately.

**Mending Fences**  
  
Wholesale partners like Foot Locker and JD Sports are finally getting some love after being sidelined by Hill’s predecessor. Foot Locker is already expanding its Nike-backed Home Court sections globally, signaling a fresh start in rebuilding trust. But the hard work isn’t over. Wholesale revenue was still down 3% last quarter, reflecting the uphill climb.  
  
Nike’s international scoreboard isn’t exactly lighting up. China revenue slumped 8% to $1.71 billion, North America fell 8% to $5.18 billion, and even Converse tripped with a 17% decline. But there’s a silver lining: gross margins held at 43.6%, slightly better than expected, thanks to tighter control over markdowns.

**A Few Wins in the Playbook**  
  
Nike scored major points off the field, locking in its NFL uniform deal through 2038—cementing its partnerships with the NFL, NBA, and MLB. These wins showcase Nike’s dominance in sports, even as its market share in sneakers takes a hit from competitors like On Running and Hoka.

Nike’s stock has slipped 27% this year, but Hill’s pivot to performance and tighter inventory controls could breathe new life into the brand. For now, though, it’s a waiting game—because turning around a giant takes time.

# FedEx Divides and Conquers with $30B Freight Spinoff

FedEx is making big moves, spinning off its freight division into a standalone public company. The freight unit—valued at over $30 billion—will fly solo within 18 months, setting the stage for FedEx to double down on its core package delivery business. Investors were thrilled, sending shares up 10% in after-hours trading.

**Breaking Down the Breakup**

FedEx Freight, the heavyweight of U.S. less-than-truckload shipping, pulls in $9.4 billion annually by hauling shipments for multiple customers on shared trucks. Spinning it off doesn’t just streamline FedEx’s structure—it could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value. Analysts are buzzing that Freight's independence could mirror the stock surges seen by rivals like Old Dominion Freight Line.

CEO Raj Subramaniam is all about focus, calling the move a chance for each company to sharpen its competitive edge. And while Freight gets a clean slate, FedEx plans to use this moment to rethink its package delivery strategy, merging its Express and Ground units.

**Clouds on the Horizon**

Of course, not everything’s rosy. FedEx reported a 1% dip in revenue and an 18% profit slide for the second quarter, thanks to weaker package demand and sluggish freight activity. Oh, and it trimmed its full-year earnings outlook to $19-$20 per share, down from $20-$21. Blame the economy, the loss of a key U.S. Postal Service contract, and customers opting for cheaper, slower delivery options.

Still, investors and analysts are hopeful. The spinoff could give FedEx the focus it needs to fix its package game, while Freight gets a chance to thrive on its own. It’s a bold move, and all eyes are on FedEx to deliver.

# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s big-ticket economic drop: the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, aka the Fed’s inflation crystal ball. It’s the last major data point of 2024 before the markets swap trading floors for holiday cheer. The spotlight is on Core PCE, which ditches food and energy volatility to focus on the stickier parts of inflation.

Last month, PCE rose 2.3% year-over-year, while Core PCE climbed 2.8%—exactly as economists called it. This time, forecasts peg overall PCE at 2.5% and Core at 2.9%. A cooler-than-expected report might mean a drama-free finish to the year, but if inflation overshoots, you’ll see Wall Street traders sweating through their eggnog.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Carnival Corp.** is cruising into 2025 on smooth seas, with analysts expecting another stellar year for the industry. As higher consumer discretionary spending sets sail, Carnival is primed to cash in. Despite historically high booking prices, travelers are locking in summer cruises at record rates. With demand buoyed by resilient spending and a strong post-pandemic rebound, Carnival’s outlook seems unsinkable. The cruise giant is set to report consensus earnings of $0.07 per share on $5.91 billion in revenue, keeping its momentum full steam ahead. ($CCL)",2024-12-20,2,2

Oh, and it trimmed its full-year earnings outlook to $19-$20 per share, down from $20-$21. Blame the economy, the loss of a key U.S. Postal Service contract, and customers opting for cheaper, slower delivery options.

Still, investors and analysts are hopeful. The spinoff could give FedEx the focus it needs to fix its package game, while Freight gets a chance to thrive on its own. It’s a bold move, and all eyes are on FedEx to deliver.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s big-ticket economic drop: the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, aka the Fed’s inflation crystal ball. It’s the last major data point of 2024 before the markets swap trading floors for holiday cheer. The spotlight is on Core PCE, which ditches food and energy volatility to focus on the stickier parts of inflation.

Last month, PCE rose 2.3% year-over-year, while Core PCE climbed 2.8%—exactly as economists called it. This time, forecasts peg overall PCE at 2.5% and Core at 2.9%. A cooler-than-expected report might mean a drama-free finish to the year, but if inflation overshoots, you’ll see Wall Street traders sweating through their eggnog.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel’s targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky – it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel’s vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn’t just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here’s the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country’s busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute—it's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to “cripple” the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Retailers Brace for Impact  
Big retailers, including Walmart, Costco, and IKEA, say they’ve prepared for the strike by stocking up early and rerouting shipments to West Coast ports. But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it’s only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering—air freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won’t escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn’t playing around. He’s leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it’s a waiting game to see how long businesses—and consumers—can hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it’s also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike’s Guidance? Just Do… It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company’s latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there’s some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled—shares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike’s buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy—much needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they’re not exactly feeling the love. Nike’s stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500’s 20% gain. Hill’s going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike’s gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn’t enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn’t lace up a win—continuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What’s Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he’ll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike’s been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s—shoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike’s product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it’s only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering—air freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won’t escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn’t playing around. He’s leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it’s a waiting game to see how long businesses—and consumers—can hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it’s also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike’s Guidance? Just Do… It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company’s latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there’s some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled—shares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike’s buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy—much needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they’re not exactly feeling the love. Nike’s stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500’s 20% gain. Hill’s going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike’s gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn’t enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn’t lace up a win—continuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What’s Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he’ll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike’s been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s—shoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike’s product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

The recent numbers haven’t exactly been brag-worthy. August saw just 99,000 new jobs, marking the fifth straight month of slowing growth. Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

1fty3mh_NKE,NKE,"Nike postpones investor day, posts mixed quarterly results as it gears up for CEO change","Nike on Tuesday said it was postponining its investor day as it delivered mixed fiscal first quarter results.

Here’s how the world’s largest sneaker retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 70 cents vs 52 cents

Revenue: $11.59 billion vs $11.65 billion

Over the last year, Nike has been accused of falling behind on innovation and ceding share to competitors as it focused on selling directly to consumers through its own websites and stores rather than through wholesalers such as Foot Locker and DSW. 

The company announced in September that CEO John Donahoe would be stepping down and would be replaced by company veteran Elliott Hill, who is scheduled to take the helm Oct. 14.

Under Donahoe’s leadership, the company grew annual sales by more than 31%, but it got there by churning out legacy franchises such as Air Force 1s, Dunks and Air Jordan 1s — not the groundbreaking styles that turned the company into a global powerhouse. 

Over the last few quarters, Donahoe has spoken about the need to improve innovation and mend Nike’s relationships with wholesalers, but the company’s board decided that Hill, who spent 32 years with Nike before retiring in 2020, would be the right person to lead its next chapter. 

Donahoe is expected to be present during the company’s conference call with investors Tuesday afternoon, but observers will be keen to see if there are any clues into where the company is planning to go under Hill’s leadership. 

The incoming CEO will need to power up Nike’s innovation pipeline, reset its relationships with wholesalers and improve morale after a series of layoffs and a breakdown in culture. 

Overall, the sneaker market has been relatively stagnant in the U.S. Consumer spending on discretionary goods such as new clothes and shoes has been sluggish, which has made Nike’s situation that much more difficult. 

Footwear sales in the U.S. are projected to grow by just 2% in 2024 compared with 2023 after barely budging between 2022 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. Athletic footwear is expected to grow by about 5.6%, the firm said. 

Nike’s performance has also been weighed down by the uneven economy in China, Nike’s third-largest market by revenue, which will be another key item to watch for in the earnings report. Nike’s performance in China is often an indicator of the region’s financial health, and in late June, it warned of a “softer outlook” in the region. However, China’s central bank recently unveiled its largest stimulus measures since the Covid pandemic, which is expected to give the region’s economy a much-needed boost. 

Nike’s fiscal first quarter would have concluded prior to those stimulus measures, but executives may share color on how sales are performing during the current period. 

Shares of Nike closed at $88.40 on Monday, down about 19% so far in 2024, significantly underperforming the S&P 500′s gains of about 21%.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel’s targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky – it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel’s vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn’t just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here’s the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country’s busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute—it's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to “cripple” the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike’s product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel’s targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky – it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel’s vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn’t just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here’s the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country’s busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute—it's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to “cripple” the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Retailers Brace for Impact  
Big retailers, including Walmart, Costco, and IKEA, say they’ve prepared for the strike by stocking up early and rerouting shipments to West Coast ports. But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it’s only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering—air freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won’t escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn’t playing around. He’s leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it’s a waiting game to see how long businesses—and consumers—can hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it’s also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike’s Guidance? Just Do… It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company’s latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there’s some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled—shares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike’s buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy—much needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they’re not exactly feeling the love. Nike’s stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500’s 20% gain. Hill’s going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike’s gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn’t enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn’t lace up a win—continuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What’s Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he’ll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike’s been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s—shoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike’s product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

# Nike Shakes It Up — CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who’s stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe’s last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

1fk31lv_NKE,NKE,Why did Bill Ackman buy Nike? Seems like their losing market share to guys like LULU.,"I just caught an analysis on Nike via Daniel Pronk and honestly, I'm just confused. The stock dropped about 53% from its all-time highs, and while its tempting, the underlying issues are a bit concerning. 

key takeaways:

* **Sales Decline**: Nike's revenue is reported to be declining, with a projected drop of around 10% year-over-year for the first quarter. This isn't just a one-time hiccup; their fiscal 2025 is looking rough too, with expected mid-single-digit declines. ([Rev and EPS projections](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/NKE/analyst))
* **Market Position**: It was noted that smaller competitors, like Lululemon, are nibbling at Nike's market share. The fashion industry is unpredictable, and you never know which brands will start gaining traction.
* **Valuation Concerns**: With a price-to-free cash flow at 18.4 Does this imply future growth?  

Is there even more market for Nike to capture? Any insight into what Ackman might be thinking?",2024-09-18,0,33

Have seen Nike pitched a few times on this sub. Has been trading in the low 20s PE ratio, which is a discount to its longer term range in the low 30s. Ackman has recently taken a stake. Seems to be a “battleground” stock, with competing narratives about whether it is still a great business, warranting a high multiple. 

In this context, this is an interesting Bloomberg article about all the missteps of Nike CEO John Donahoe. Overproduced some of the rare sneakers, underprioritized product development, and it seems the DTC push backfired. While Nike captured a higher margin on DTC, the floor space they relinquished in shops was taken over by upstarts which began to take consumer mindshare. ",2024-09-13,281,176

# Introduction

The chart shows a long-term Call Ratio Spread on Nike Inc. (NKE). This strategy involves buying and selling different quantities of call options to create a net credit position. This analysis will dive into the setup's specifics, its advantages and disadvantages, and the market scenarios in which this strategy would be beneficial.

The spread was found with the use of NinjaSpread.

# Understanding the Call Ratio Spread

A Call Ratio Spread typically involves buying one call option and selling two or more call options at a higher strike price. This strategy is generally used when the trader has a neutral to slightly bullish outlook on the underlying stock.

# Strategy Breakdown

1. **Entry**:
   * **Buying Calls**: One or more call options are purchased at a lower strike price.
   * **Selling Calls**: Two or more call options are sold at a higher strike price.
2. **Net Credit**:
   * This strategy is established for a net debit because the premium received from selling the higher strike calls is lower than the premium paid for buying the lower strike calls.

# Market Outlook

This strategy is most effective under the following market conditions:

1. **Neutral to Slightly Bullish**:
   * The underlying stock price is expected to increase and fill the gap by September 2024.
2. **Volatility**:
   * Moderate volatility is favorable but the strategy is vega negative at this point.

# Advantages of the Call Ratio Spread

1. **Limited Risk**:
   * The risk is limited to the difference between the strikes minus the net credit received, up to the higher strike price.
2. **Profit Potential**:
   * Profit is maximized if the stock price is near the sold strike prices at expiration.
   * The maximum profit occurs if the stock price closes exactly at the strike price of the sold calls.
3. **Net Credit**:
   * The strategy is initiated for a net credit, meaning that the trader receives a premium upfront, which can be beneficial in terms of cash flow.

# Disadvantages of the Call Ratio Spread

1. **Unlimited Risk Beyond the Sold Strike**:
   * If the underlying stock price moves significantly beyond the strike price of the sold calls, the losses can be substantial.
2. **Complexity**:
   * This strategy is more complex than simpler options strategies like buying a single call or put. It requires a good understanding of options and risk management.
3. **Margin Requirements**:
   * Due to the nature of selling naked calls, this strategy may require a higher margin, tying up more capital.",2024-07-23,12,1
1e66cxo_NKE,NKE,NKE predictions for short/long term,"Hi, beginner investor here.

I would like to know other people opinion about the major drop of Nike price recently.  
  
Q1: How do you see this? Worth for long term investments? It is still a big company that I guess nobody expect to disappear, so maybe on long run there might be some benefits considering that currently the company is in the same place where it was \~5 years ago.

Q2: I checked their website and on investor section it is mentioned that dividends are paid quarterly, but (in my case) I checked the XTB information and it is shown that the last dividend date is July 2024. Might be the case that dividends will be restricted because of current price fall?

1e5kir7_NKE,NKE,NKE Puts - We at a new 90 top,"Nike has terrible products, no innovation, tech CEO that doesn’t understand how to run a retail business. There are systemic issues at Nike that will take years to unravel and for it to bounce back. In 90 days this will be looked at as the top. 

Even though Nike has fallen 20%, there’s still another blood letting waiting to happen. Nike is not undersold, usually stocks would be undersold for a day or two, it’s been undersold since earnings, that tells me there’s a big institutional player systematically selling their position, once other institutions realize they might be the ones holding the bag, it’s a sinking ship the stock is only going plummet further.  

Also to everyone pointing out the olympics will save them, they’re in for a big surprise. Olympic outfits have already been priced in and generally NKE declines during the olympics. Plus we’re bound for some big global  invasion or conflict that will cause the whole market to go down after the Olympics.

1e0cxuw_MA,MA,Nike is a bargain right now ,"Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984

You have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. 

This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. 

Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: 

https://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc

The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. 

The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. 

So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. 

Lets just look at the actual income here: 

https://preview.redd.it/xzur7vt5hsbd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af40a030a7bcd30e707eced540bcd4b524d0718

Over the last 10 years, the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak, these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income.

Even right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P/E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed:

The last time the P/E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011...

  
Now heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks/months:

Since  the fed hasnt cut rates yet, theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3-5% further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. 

Now lastly, what brought me to this trade idea at all? Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike? I remember 2022.

In 2022, there was a big gap down and this brought Adobe to prices not 1st achieved since Sept of 2018. I passed this one up. I let the fear keep me out of the trade. Surely everyone who was selling was correct. Obviously thats the crowd that always wins. 

Since we are dealing with panic, lets get up close and examine how the panic works: 

https://preview.redd.it/xrmmklaxksbd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7998168ec3829f129b26d6c91fabde81a34a86d5

The day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the  next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. 

Quite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10/10. 

It won't happen overnight, but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3-4 months. Even if things get ""bad"" around the election period, Nike already got the business.

1e0cxuw_V,V,Nike is a bargain right now ,"Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984

You have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. 

This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. 

Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: 

https://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc

The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. 

The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. 

So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. 

Lets just look at the actual income here:

Since we are dealing with panic, lets get up close and examine how the panic works: 

https://preview.redd.it/xrmmklaxksbd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7998168ec3829f129b26d6c91fabde81a34a86d5

The day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the  next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. 

Quite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10/10. 

It won't happen overnight, but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3-4 months. Even if things get ""bad"" around the election period, Nike already got the business.

1e0cxuw_TSLA,TSLA,Nike is a bargain right now ,"Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984

You have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. 

This is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. 

Even from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: 

https://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc

The lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. 

The difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. 

So what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. 

Lets just look at the actual income here: 

https://preview.redd.it/xzur7vt5hsbd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af40a030a7bcd30e707eced540bcd4b524d0718

Over the last 10 years, the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak, these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. 

Check out the P/E below

Even right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P/E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed:

The last time the P/E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011...

  
Now heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks/months:

https://preview.redd.it/k89wawq9isbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=584b84419187792d995cf8564dd1b2a8b2634a30

They are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. Then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. All of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel, all the analysts will be upgrading nike. Show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do AFTER they bought the ol dippity skippity. They are going to have to do something with the money. They will see Nike. I doubt  they will just pass it up. 

Since  the fed hasnt cut rates yet, theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3-5% further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. 

Now lastly, what brought me to this trade idea at all? Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike? I remember 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/oj4sxjz7ksbd1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=1865e6cf78f673a4d37ae4b46ff9aeb0e85f2271

This is during an Olympic quarter, which in the past has caused Nike to see greater-than-average sales.



So the key question here is: How will Nike grow out of this?



Well, first, how did they get into this mess? I think it comes down to a) shifting too rapidly from retail partners to direct-to-consumer, but then also stagnating on popular shoe lines instead of innovating (footwear covers \~64% of revenue)



They said on their most recent earnings call that they are accelerating their innovation pipeline, but, they won't be available until the spring of 2025.

1drcnm5_NKE,NKE,Nike - Opportunity for the dividend portfolio?,"Nike has a strong dividend history and currently pays an annual dividend of $1.48 per share, which equates to a dividend yield of around 1.5%. The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and plans to continue this tradition, indicating solid financial health and sustainable growth.

The trick now, of course, is to find the right entry point into the market. I help myself with a chart on a weekly basis, which currently offers the possibility of a wolf's mouth. A wolf's mouth consists of 5 pattern points, and the lines represent the signal and target areas of the price movement. For a signal in a wolf mouth, the lower yellow line must be broken, and then the signal line must be penetrated again from bottom to top in a reversal, in our case. 

In this situation, it is important to pay attention to the chart's behavior. If the price bounces off the signal line (1-3) from below, a rapid continuation of the previous short movement is to be expected. Similarly, if we penetrate the wolf, price targets up to at least the open gap or the target line (1-4) are realistic, providing a confident outlook on the potential outcomes. 

https://preview.redd.it/rkia9l55ri9d1.png?width=3654&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0945cd1c8384ba539b13b978277d485ade7b17e

A harmonic pattern can be used in the chart to limit the current downward movement. In our scenario, we use a butterfly pattern. It is particularly essential to look at this in combination. Remember that the situation at the wolf trigger is crucial.  We can, therefore, try to confirm this Harmonic pattern by penetrating or bouncing off the signal line of the wolf. If the butterfly pattern starts, we can use another Fibonacci from the harmonic pattern points A to D to forecast the starting points of the suspected movement.

https://preview.redd.it/ozypjj4cri9d1.png?width=3639&format=png&auto=webp&s=8429a41489592c67242e814d95a63cc471e9ca50

After the situation at the signal line of the wolf, you have to take care of a stop loss. I also use the rules of technical analysis here. I use the Elliott wave correction rule for wave 2, which states that the path of wave 2 may correct a maximum of 99.99% of the movement of wave 1.

https://preview.redd.it/y3k6h37hri9d1.png?width=3624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d9ace2b472549a3a15c83da3e7e45f6c044b2cb

The point of the whole scenario is to find a safe entry that can quickly the Stop Loss set to break even. Just so you know, I am an active day trader and trade very actively, which means you must maintain the trade. Likewise, I am aware that if an experienced Elliott Waver colleague sees this chart, he will point out to me that the short target after the Elliott waves is much higher. This has to do with the fact that an Elliott wave 3 has to run at least the 161 Fibonacci extension. I am aware of this, but as I said, the strategy is to find Hedgeable entries without messing up the equity and drawdown value in the account. I always care not to lose anything in my trading style, so I always break even quickly. The account grows via the trading frequency and partial sales, and when the price runs through, there is a significant and profitable rebound as the cherry on the sundae. By combining these three completely different strategies, good insights and deductions with a certain logic can be derived, which only sometimes works for me too. But it's better than shooting blindly into the air. The next step is checking various indicators. One Rule of Elliott waves is that a divergence should accompany a C correction wave. This Rule is essential because, as you already know, wave two may correct a maximum of 99.99%. Of course, we also need to ensure that the fundamental conditions for a correction are in place, which is the case here. 

https://preview.redd.it/94mjak5nri9d1.png?width=3642&format=png&auto=webp&s=496f09aad9cb0831d5a33e412e9696335000ba3a

Even if they are often dismissed as inferior, I always recommend taking a look at the moving averages. In our scenario, the picture of the moving averages in the weekly time frame is fundamentally against us. Even if you scroll back up to the previous chart, you will see that there is currently no significant divergence at the current price level. 

https://preview.redd.it/2dn6o5orri9d1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d708a8c2131fa426ebad4fcc446f83a69507c16

The indicative chart, therefore, initially speaks against the structural trade setup. Still, looking at it from the perspective that we are looking for a Hedgeable entry, a retest of the moving averages can appear quite plausible. If we count back 50 candles from the blue moving average, it should rise in the near future. Consider the area of the Harmonic Butterfly Pattern between the pattern points B-C.

If we now do the same with the 200 moving average in red, we can see that it is in the falling phase, which means that the line of the 200 moving average should fall. The current strong falling candle has the appearance of a so-called Marubozu candle, which also goes against our idea. Marubozu candles do not have a significant trading range and consist only of the candle's body.

You may remember what we talked about at the beginning of this post, it was about the wolf. We need to determine how the price behaves at the signal line. In practice, after the signal line is broken, an intraday timeframe is used to refine the entry. I use a Multitimeframe principle for this, which would go beyond the scope of this article. However, if you are interested, I can write a separate article when the opportunity arises.

==Begin Quotes=================

Brendan Eng’s running group in Portland, Ore., has roughly quadrupled in size since 2021 to about 80 runners. And that doesn’t include the representatives from New Balance, Hoka or Asics who regularly show up at its events to let runners try new sneakers, give out free merchandise and pay for drinks after the workout. 

One local giant has been conspicuously absent from the road-running scene: Nike NKE -19.98%decrease; red down pointing triangle.  

“In the three years I’ve led this group there have been only two Nike road demos. I feel like I’ve seen the Hoka rep four times this year,” Eng said.   


As the popularity of run clubs soared since Covid—among both runners and shoemakers—some members of the avid running community in the Portland area, which includes Nike’s Beaverton, Ore., headquarters, say the swoosh has faded from the scene. The hometown brand’s absence in a region widely viewed as a national hub of running culture has broader implications.

Nike, which has long monopolized the attention and wallets of avid runners, in recent years shifted its focus to other areas of its business including the release of limited-edition sneakers. Competitors swooped in, resulting in an increasingly fragmented market that has dented Nike’s finances and prompted a strategic reset at the sneaker company. 

Nike on Thursday reported an unexpected sales decline in its latest quarter and cut its revenue outlook for the year, citing lighter traffic to stores and worsening macroeconomic conditions in China. Sales grew 1% for the full year—its worst results in more than two decades excluding the first year of the pandemic and the 2008-09 financial crisis. The results sent shares down more than 10% in aftermarket trading.

Executives acknowledge they lost ground in the critical running category and say they are doubling efforts to regain a stronger grasp of the market. They are betting that a new line of shoes will give it a boost during the Paris Olympics this summer.

Of course, we also need to ensure that the fundamental conditions for a correction are in place, which is the case here. 

https://preview.redd.it/94mjak5nri9d1.png?width=3642&format=png&auto=webp&s=496f09aad9cb0831d5a33e412e9696335000ba3a

Even if they are often dismissed as inferior, I always recommend taking a look at the moving averages. In our scenario, the picture of the moving averages in the weekly time frame is fundamentally against us. Even if you scroll back up to the previous chart, you will see that there is currently no significant divergence at the current price level. 

https://preview.redd.it/2dn6o5orri9d1.png?width=3666&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d708a8c2131fa426ebad4fcc446f83a69507c16

The indicative chart, therefore, initially speaks against the structural trade setup. Still, looking at it from the perspective that we are looking for a Hedgeable entry, a retest of the moving averages can appear quite plausible. If we count back 50 candles from the blue moving average, it should rise in the near future. Consider the area of the Harmonic Butterfly Pattern between the pattern points B-C.

If we now do the same with the 200 moving average in red, we can see that it is in the falling phase, which means that the line of the 200 moving average should fall. The current strong falling candle has the appearance of a so-called Marubozu candle, which also goes against our idea. Marubozu candles do not have a significant trading range and consist only of the candle's body.

You may remember what we talked about at the beginning of this post, it was about the wolf. We need to determine how the price behaves at the signal line. In practice, after the signal line is broken, an intraday timeframe is used to refine the entry. I use a Multitimeframe principle for this, which would go beyond the scope of this article. However, if you are interested, I can write a separate article when the opportunity arises.

1dbjx7o_NKE,NKE,The Olympic Effect: Why Nike Stock Will Soar in 2024,"The Olympic Effect: Why Nike $NKE Stock Will Soar in 2024

The Olympic Games, a global spectacle of athletic prowess and national pride, are not just a sporting event; they are a powerful marketing platform. Nike, the world’s leading sportswear brand, is a master of capitalizing on this platform, investing heavily in athletes, campaigns, and activations to leverage the Olympic spotlight. With the Paris 2024 Games on the horizon, Nike is poised to experience a significant surge in stock price driven by a combination of factors:

**1. The Power of Olympic Visibility:**

The Olympics are a global phenomenon, reaching billions of viewers worldwide. Nike's prominent presence, through athlete sponsorships, official partnerships, and impactful marketing campaigns, ensures that its brand is seen by a massive audience. This broad exposure directly translates into increased brand awareness, consumer trust, and ultimately, sales.

**2. The Endorsement Effect:**

Nike's roster of elite athletes, many of whom will compete in the Olympics, serves as powerful brand ambassadors. The victories, performances, and stories of these athletes resonate deeply with consumers, associating Nike with success, determination, and achievement. This positive association directly boosts brand perception and consumer loyalty.

**3. Leveraging the 'Olympic Spirit':**

The Olympics are more than just sports; they embody values of unity, perseverance, and athletic excellence. Nike expertly taps into this 'Olympic spirit' by creating emotional campaigns that resonate with audience aspirations. These campaigns foster a sense of connection with the brand, strengthening its identity as a symbol of athletic achievement and personal ambition.

**4. The 2024 Paris Advantage:**

The Paris 2024 Games, with their inherent fashion and style focus, present an ideal platform for Nike. The brand's reputation for stylish and innovative designs aligns perfectly with the Parisian aesthetic. Expect to see targeted campaigns and product launches that capitalize on this unique cultural context, further enhancing Nike's appeal to a global audience.

**5. A Strategic Marketing Campaign:**

Nike consistently delivers innovative and impactful marketing campaigns during the Olympics. These campaigns, often featuring iconic athletes and compelling storytelling, generate significant buzz and social media engagement, further amplifying brand visibility and driving consumer interest.

**6. Increased Consumer Demand:**

The Olympics create a peak season for athletic wear and sports equipment. This demand surge, fueled by consumer excitement and the desire to emulate their favorite athletes, creates a direct positive impact on Nike's sales and revenue.

**7. Long-Term Impact:**

While the immediate buzz surrounding the Olympics is significant, the impact on Nike's stock price extends beyond the Games. The brand's association with athletic excellence and global events like the Olympics builds lasting brand loyalty and strengthens its position as a market leader.

**Conclusion:**

The upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics represent a highly strategic opportunity for Nike to leverage its powerful marketing prowess and capitalize on global brand visibility. By amplifying its presence through athlete sponsorships, impactful campaigns, and a clever understanding of the Olympic spirit, Nike is poised to experience a substantial boost in stock value. This surge will be driven by increased brand awareness, consumer engagement, and a surge in demand for Nike products, solidifying its position as a dominant force in the sportswear industry.

Nike Reverses Course as Innovation Stalls and Rivals Gain Ground  
Shoe giant stumbled as CEO John Donahoe pulled away from retailers and relied on old hits. Now it says it’s refocusing on cutting-edge footwear for athletes.

By Inti Pacheco  
April 21, 2024 9:00 pm ET

In late February, Nike NKE -1.26%decrease; red down pointing triangle boss John Donahoe led a virtual all-hands meeting where he delivered a message to his staff: The company wasn’t performing at its best and he held himself accountable.  
  
Two weeks earlier, Nike had announced it would lay off more than 1,600 employees.  
  
Now, as the CEO spoke at the meeting, critical comments started to fill the chat window on the Zoom call while more than 20,000 employees watched.   
  
“Accountability: I do not think that word means what you think it means,” an employee wrote. “If this is cost cutting, how about a CEO salary cut?” another wrote. Soon a cascade of laughing emojis filled the screen.

=================================================================  
Quotes:

Since the pandemic, Nike has lost ground in its critical running category while it focused on pumping out old hits and preparing for an e-commerce revolution that never came. The moves, current and former employees say, have eroded a culture of innovation and edginess that made Nike one of the world’s best-known brands.

. . . 

Among the reversals: As Covid raged and more shopping moved online, Nike cut ties with longtime retail partners such as DSW and Urban Outfitters and tried selling more merchandise directly to consumers. It is now asking some of those stores for help clearing out its overstuffed shelves and warehouses.

. . .

The strategic missteps have animated a debate inside the company about its identity. In its zeal to boost digital sales, some current and former employees say, Nike veered from its roots as a maker of cutting-edge footwear for serious athletes. It has opened itself to competition from newcomers such as On and Hoka, which have borrowed from the playbook that fueled Nike’s rise—including focusing on sport over lifestyle, and taking risks on innovation.  
  
Nike’s once torrid growth has stalled. Sales for the quarter ended Feb. 29 were flat compared with a year earlier, and shares in the company have declined 24% over the past year, compared with a 19% gain in the S&P 500.  

. . . 

One of the casualties of Donahoe’s 2020 transformation was a multibillion-dollar operation dedicated to developing footwear sold for under $100. The company deprioritized more-affordable footwear that usually sold to the sales partners that Nike was leaving behind. The move left Nike skewed toward higher-priced shoes.  
  
The first evidence of cracks in Nike’s new approach appeared early last year when Foot Locker Chief Executive Mary Dillon said during an earnings call the brand had reversed course and was sending the retailer a wider assortment of Nike products. By the summer, Macy’s and DSW were saying the same thing.

. . . .

Often quoting Knight, the Nike co-founder, former employees said the principle always was to first capture the market for hard-core athletes with innovative performance gear, and the casual consumer would follow.  
  
In early February, Hoka owner Deckers Outdoor tapped Nike alums to take over both the parent company and the shoe brand. Hoka had $1.4 billion in sales for the year through March 2023, compared with about $352 million three years earlier.  

. . .

Current and former Nike executives believe the future of the company is in its app ecosystem, like the Nike Training and Running Club or its SNKRS app, and the data it can harness from them to help design and sell products. Inside the company, leaders have long tried to draw comparisons to Apple when talking about Nike’s innovation and design culture.

. . .

As part of its accelerated focus on digital sales, Nike hired about 3,500 people to join what the company calls its global technology group, which includes consumer insights and data analytics. Executives at the time said they were investing in “demand sensing,” “insight gathering” and a new inventory system.   
  
Former Nike employees with knowledge of the consumer insights strategy said executives misinterpreted the data in ways that overestimated demand for retro franchises. 

. . . 

At the Olympics preview event this month, the company took over the historic Palais Brongniart in central Paris with a three-day event to unveil its new Air line. Guests wandered through a museum-like, conveyor-belt installation highlighting Nike’s product evolutions and research and development programs. Athletes including runners Sha’Carri Richardson and Eliud Kipchoge modeled the new gear. Retired tennis great Serena Williams narrated the company’s lavish introduction video before appearing on stage.   
  
Outside, 30-foot orange statues of Nike-sponsored athletes including LeBron James, Kylian Mbappé and Victor Wembanyama stood guard.

** accidental graphic is from the link from adidas ceo saying that China was recovering.. 

Regarding Nike, today’s news wasn’t unexpected as the warnings (Sam Poser from Williams Trading) came as early as last week that the company was gonna miss. 

Actually the numbers wasn’t so bad, sales was flat and earning beat, that US and China sales were up was unexpected (Europe and Converse were down),  and it caused an initial bump up of the share price.

But the share price dropped 5-6% AH when the company forecasted that fy2025 was going to be soft in the first half and sales was going to decline by single digit in 1H and only pick up only in 2nd half of fy2025. 

Well it sounds terrible until you realise that Nike’s financial year is from June to May, which means that the calendar year 2024 is a Zzzz year while they try and fix the problem.

I will probably sit tight with my 0.5% portfolio of Nke and buy some more after the swoon.

I see a couple of catalysts here:

- Paris Olympics. 
- Continued business recovery in China. ( adidas ceo [commented](https://www.ft.com/content/d1bf3d32-176f-4110-a04d-4448268d1946) last week he was bullish on China) 

Regarding Lulu, they fell 10% AH due to guidance. The difference between the two is that Nike has been falling all of last year while the inverse is true for Lulu.

I will do some DD on Lulu later today, I want to be convinced that Lulu isn’t a fad and more of a lifestyle choice like Nike. 

TLDR: if you don’t buy high quality companies when they are cheap, then when do you buy them? Our job, as value investors is to check and see if the problem is temporary or a permanent impairment of the business.

1bkizww_NKE,NKE,Nike beats holiday revenue estimates — but its China sales are slowing down,"Nike’s China sales continued to slow during its holiday quarter, but the retailer beat estimates on the top and bottom line, helped by better than expected growth in North America and price changes.

Here’s how the company performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 77 cents vs. 74 cents expected

Revenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.28 billion expected

Nike shares dropped 5% in extended trading.

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 29 was $1.17 billion, or 77 cents per share, compared with $1.24 billion, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding 21 cents per share related to restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been 98 cents, the company said.

Sales rose to $12.43 billion, up slightly from $12.39 billion a year earlier.

In North America, where demand has been unsteady, sales rose about 3% to $5.07 billion, compared with estimates of $4.75 billion, according to StreetAccount.

Meanwhile, sales in the rest of Nike’s regions came in below estimates. In China, sales reached $2.08 billion, just below the $2.09 billion analysts had expected. Revenues in the region climbed 5%, but growth there has decelerated as demand normalizes after Covid-19 lockdowns.

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, revenue fell 3% to $3.14 billion, worse than the $3.17 billion that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. In China, sales grew 5% to $2.08 billion, just below the $2.09 billion analysts had expected. Sales in Asia Pacific and Latin America rose 3% to $1.65 billion, below the $1.69 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

As consumers pull back on spending on discretionary items like clothes and shoes, Nike has spent the past few months focused on what it can control: cutting costs and becoming more efficient so it can drive profits and protect its margins. 

In December, it announced a broad restructuring plan to reduce costs by about $2 billion over the next three years. It also cut its sales guidance as it warned of softer demand in the quarters ahead. 

Two months later, it said it was shedding 2% of its workforce, or more than 1,500 jobs, so it could invest in its growth areas, such as running, the women’s category and the Jordan brand.

The early innings of Nike’s cost cuts, which involve simplifying its assortment, reducing management layers and increasing automation, likely helped the retailer beat earnings expectations in the three months ended Nov. 30, even as it missed sales estimates for the second quarter in a row. 

The cuts, along with “strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight rates,” also contributed to a 1.7 percentage point gain in gross margin — the first time the company saw its gross margin increase compared to the prior year in at least six quarters. 

Nike’s gross margin recovery continued during the quarter. The retailer’s gross margin grew by 1.5 percentage points to 44.8%, driven by “strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight and logistics costs.” The gains were partially offset by higher product input costs and restructuring charges, company said.

Nike is still considered a market leader in the sneaker and apparel space, but the category has become more crowded and the retailer has had to work harder to compete. Some analysts say its assortment has lost focus and say the company has fallen behind on innovation, giving up market share to newer entrants like Hoka and On Running, as well as legacy brands like Brooks Running and New Balance. 

Last month, Nike launched the Book 1, its latest basketball shoes with NBA star Devin Booker. But the release wasn’t well received because it “looked more like a casual sneaker instead of [a] basketball shoe,” according to a research note from Jane Hali & Associates. 

The firm is now neutral on Nike long term, compared to its previous rating of positive, because it’s unclear where the brand is headed, said senior analyst Jessica Ramirez.

She’s noticed that Nike has removed a lot of products from its offering, which indicates it’s preparing to bring in new styles. But it’s still unclear exactly what those changes will look like.

“They’ve already said [those changes are] going to take some time,” Ramirez told CNBC prior to Nike’s earnings release. “Its a little concerning to know they don’t have a solid plan that we know of yet.”

First off, these earnings coming up? They ain't lookin' pretty. Analysts getting cold feet and slashing those EPS and revenue estimates like there's no tomorrow. Revenue estimated to be down 1% YoY, operating income down 7%, EPS down 6%...I'm talking fiscal Q3 '24 lookin' like a dumpster fire. 🗑️🔥

China used to be Nike's golden goose but now it's turning into a lead balloon. Politics messin' with the brand and Winnie the Pooh ain't playin' nice no more. 🇨🇳💩 If China sneezes, Nike catches a cold.

Also, wanted to cop me some fresh Nikes from Footlocker the other day but they were out of my size. And those sales peeps couldn't care less about finding me an alternative. Nike losing mindshare on the sales floor, you heard it here first. 😤

Now I ain't no 🌈🐻 but facts are facts. EPS estimates down 11% in the last year, revenue estimates slashed by 5-9%. Free cash flow yield finally hitting 4% - first time since 2019! Too little too late if you ask me. 📉

Technical traders getting ready to short this to the earth's core if it breaks $82. Morningstar trying to prop it up with that cute lil $136 ""fair value"" but internal models ain't buying it, putting it between $85-100 tops. 📊

Nike might've bounced back from that ""brown shoe craze"" in the 90s but this feels different. Inventory to revenue ratios just getting back to normal after 3 brutal quarters...and who knows if this is the new normal. 📦📉

So unless JPow turns on the money printer again or Xi Jinping starts rocking Jordans, I'm staying the hell away from $NKE. Puts on deck, maybe nibble on some lottos if it craters post-earnings. 💸🎰

1bk6ltf_NKE,NKE,Why NKE will go down and FDX will go up today,"Alright degenerates, gather 'round for some next-level plays. Today AH Nike and FedEx will have their earnings and this is exactly what’s gonna happen.

Puts on NKE (Nike)

Nike might be all about ""Just Do It,"" but I'm here to tell you to just short it. Why? Because Nike's been riding high on hype for too long. Their recent shoe releases? Meh. The market's saturated, the shoes suck nowadays. So, short the swoosh.

Going Long on FDX (FedEx)

Now, onto the tendies. FDX, baby! FedEx is the ultimate underdog ready to take flight.

With the holiday season past us, we're talking about packages flying off the shelves faster than Elon's tweets. And guess who's cashing in on that? That's right, FDX. Plus, they're expanding their footprint internationally, so we're not just talking domestic tendies here – it's global, baby.

So, buckle up, fellow autists. It's time to make some money. Short NKE and long FDX.",2024-03-21,71,153

1asjho9_NKE,NKE,"Nike to lay off 2% of employees, cutting more than 1,500 jobs amid restructuring","Nike is cutting 2% of its current workforce, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring, the company said late Thursday.

The Beaverton, Oregon-based sneaker giant said it wants to better use its capital to invest in its growth areas, such as running, women’s and the Jordan brand.

“This is how we will reignite our growth,” CEO John Donahoe said in a memo obtained by CNBC.

“This is a painful reality and not one that I take lightly,” he added. “We are not currently performing at our best, and I ultimately hold myself and my leadership team accountable.”

Nike said the layoffs will take place in two phases. The company will start the first round this week, and finish the second by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, which typically concludes at the end of May. Cuts in Nike’s EMEA region will be on a different timeline based on local labor laws, the company said.

It’s not clear which departments will experience layoffs, but they will not affect retail employees at Nike’s stores or warehouse workers, the company said.

The cuts come as consumers become more cautious in their spending and the retail industry braces for a demand slowdown for discretionary items such as clothes and shoes, which is Nike’s bread and butter.

In December, Nike unveiled a broad restructuring plan to cut costs by about $2 billion over the next three years. It lowered its sales outlook as it prepared for lower demand and wholesale orders, soft sales online and a marketplace that relies more on promotions.

As part of its plan to cut costs, Nike said it was looking to simplify its product assortment, increase automation and its use of technology, streamline the organization by reducing management layers and leverage its scale “to drive greater efficiency.”

Shortly before the restructuring was announced, The Oregonian reported that Nike had been quietly laying off employees over the past several weeks and had signaled that it was planning for a broader restructuring. A series of divisions saw cuts, including recruitment, sourcing, brand, engineering, human resources and innovation, the outlet reported.

It’s not clear how many jobs in total Nike has cut since December.

On Friday morning, Oppenheimer downgraded Nike to perform and lowered its 12- to 18-month price target, citing sluggish consumer demand, lulls in production innovation and competition.

“While NKE is by no means broken, we believe that the company and its brand are transitioning, near-term,” the firm said.

Donahoe said laid off staffers will receive a comprehensive package of financial, health-care and outplacement support services.

“We will emerge stronger and better equipped to fulfill our purpose to serve all athletes and grow the future of sport,” Donahoe said.

18kox1i_NKE,NKE,"Expected Moves this Week - GDP, a low VIX, IWM and earnings from Nike, FedEx and Micron","We enter what will be the last 5-day trading week of the year. Both Christmas Week and New Year will feature 3 day weekends with the holidays both falling on Monday. Due to the rally we've seen into year-end and the upcoming calendar implied vol is low across the board. The realized vol in the indices has been low as well, with moves mostly to the upside and red days not able to string together any sort of meaningful pullback. Small caps have shown the greatest relative strength recently. Note the IWM expected move below which has been seeing much more realized moves than the other major indices. IWM got near the 200 level last week but found some sellers above 199 on Friday. Keep an eye on that index for any breakout. Small caps ripping higher can inject some volatility back into the market as investors reach for upside calls for fear of missing out. The VIX printed below 12 briefly last week. Some of the lowest VIX prints tend to come in December and Early Jan historically.

The earnings calendar wraps up for the end of 2024 to some extent this week with FedEx, Nike, and Micron highlighting. The economic calendar starts quietly but has GDP and PCE at the end of the week.

16r2uz6_NKE,NKE,"Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.","Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting. 

The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future. 

For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:

https://preview.redd.it/ga156iq9i8qb1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=deef6e981dc525ff4abdf70c04272cdf0eb39f1a

And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:  


https://preview.redd.it/w72vsxu8i8qb1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=d55c0113ee3780eea6c3efc9d40b5df1b8a249cc

There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:

* **SPY expected move this week: 1.5%**
* **QQQ expected move this week: 1.9%**

14m299g_NKE,NKE,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

-Foot locker tanked the shoe industry today. But foot locker and nike are two completely different companies. 
Foot locker is a dying retail shoe store.(the value of these two different companies is EXTREMELY DIFFERENT)
Nike is an international sportswear conglomerate which has extreme fashion appeal(especially to our younger generations-looking at you air jordans) and has been succesfully switching to Direct-to-consumer model with its Nike, Sneakers app, and uptick of spending on marketing. 

-Reactions in the stock market are mostly over-reactions

-Nike has beat expectations consistently during some of the worst economic conditions weve seen in a very long time.

**Last Week – Slightly higher for stocks put plenty of volatility**.

SPY was up 1.1% on the week, a move less than half of what options were pricing. However, the market had multiple swings of more than 3% within the week and closed the week badly with a selloff on Friday. The VIX closed the week slightly higher but also saw large swings, nearly 30 on the upper end and 22 on the lower end. Last week’s volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation. Some of the best-performing stocks last week were in large-cap tech as a rotation to those names was spurred by lower interest rates and declining treasury yields.

Continuing signs of stress in the banking sector could spook stocks and confuse the options market, attempting to price both the downside market risk of bank runs and the potential for melt-ups happening elsewhere as rotations take place among investors eyeing declining yields (and a potentially dovish Fed). As one example among many, Microsft (MSFT) was higher by more than 12% last week, while KRE (the regional bank etf) was lower by 14%. Those type of competing moves resulted in an overall market that was almost flat on the week, but underneath the hood was some chaos.

Back to treasuries, short-term yields saw some of their wildest swings in years. For instance, the 2-year yield closed the week at 3.85%, down from 5% on March 7th. That’s a fast move. The bond market is essentially calling the Fed’s bluff on where rates will be in the near future. Speaking of the Fed…

**This Week – A Big Decision by The Fed**

A consortium of mid-sized banks sent a letter over the weekend to the FDIC requesting a rules change to guarantee deposits for the next two years in an attempt to stem further bank runs. A couple of weeks ago it was assumed the Fed would keep its foot on the gas on rate hikes and the market was settling into an assumption of higher rates for longer as inflation numbers remained somewhat stubborn. All that has now changed and the Fed has big decisions to make in the next few meetings. The FOMC announcement is Wednesday and a Powell presser follows. The market still assumes a 25 basis point hike (after some thought 50 just a few weeks ago) but a pause wouldn’t be a shock at this point. The reaction by the market to any of those scenarios would be tough to read ahead of time because the reasons given by the Fed are arguably more important.

SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, similar to last week. The majority of the move is being priced by options for the actual FOMC day. Here’s this week’s SPY levels for a 2.6% expected move, about $400 on the upside and $380 on the downside. Note the bulge in the expected move chart mid-week, as option IV jumps from about 19 before the meeting to 26 after:

The stock is having some good news, rating upgrades due to the earnings report but I recognized a double top pattern in the $118.5 price area so my idea was to take the stock short.  I took two starters to feel the stock and commit to the trade, after it reached $118.5 I expected a reversal pattern and a trend change and so it was. $NKE created a new double top and as soon as the trend changed direction I entered the trade at full risk with a stop above the daily high

With implied volatility near the highs of the year, there’s a who’s who of market-leading stocks and major ETFs in the 100 IV rank lists. Of stocks whose current IV is near their highs of the year include, AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, INTC, META, GOOGL as well as banking names like BAC and MS. On the ETF side, XLF, XLE as well as IWM and SPY. In other words, there’s very few idiosyncratic pockets of high IV in the market, a lot of fear across the board, and not many places to hide.

From an options trading standpoint, that means calls and puts are expensive. call and put spreads a little less expensive, and credit spreads with very wide breakevens. For instance, here’s a comparison of two Iron Condors in Amazon. Both are based on the current Expected Move, with the stock currently around $114. Both have wide breakevens from the current stock price, and are obviously selling at a level of elevated IV.

The first expires on October 21st, risks around 3/2 and has breakevens at 103 on the downside and 125 on the upside. That 103 level is near the lows of the year.

The second expires Nov 18th, risk is close to 1/1, and has breakevens around 98.50 on the downside, and 128.50 on the upside. That 98.50 breakeven is below the lowest levels of the year for AMZN.

**Last Week –** Markets made another outsized move last week, this time to the upside. SPY was higher by more than 6%, a significantly larger move than the 2.7% move options were pricing. That follows weekly moves of more than 5% lower the past few weeks. The majority of last week’s move higher happened on two days, Tuesday to start the week, and Friday to end the week.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.4% move for the upcoming week (about $9 in either direction), which is slightly less than last week. This week includes the end of a month and quarter for markets on Thursday (so an additional ETF expiry on Thursday) followed by a weekly expiration Friday into a 3 day Holiday weekend.

>the VIX was near 35 several times last week which is close to the highs the VIX has seen in earlier spikes this year (March and early May). In both those earlier cases a VIX above 35 marked a temporary low in the market.

A VIX spike to 35 once again marked a tradeable low in the markets. Prior market bounces this year ran out of steam with the VIX 19 in early April, and 23 in early June before stocks reversed lower. The VIX is still historically higher than average.

### In the News

One month ago we checked in on oil & gas stocks and noted that despite the stocks “crashing higher” alongside the price of oil, implied volatility in the equity options was not spiking like implied volatility in commodity options tends to. That left equity options vulnerable to underpricing a reversal in oil prices:

>For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100. Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either.  
These stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have “crashed higher” towards all-time highs alongside oil itself, but the implied volatility of options in the single names are acting more like a stock near highs and less like a volatile commodity near highs where one typically sees IV *increase* as the commodity price goes higher. Meaning Puts and Put Spreads in particular may cost less than might otherwise be expected. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge.

The commodity side of things did indeed reverse the past few weeks, to the tune of about 15% in some cases. And Occidental (OXY) and Exxon Mobile (XOM) followed suit. OXY and XOM are both down roughly 18% in the past month, even more than Oil. XOM options are pricing a move of around 20% for the rest of 2022. A move that wouldn’t even take XOM back to its highs of a few weeks ago. This is one example of how the expected move can be used as a gut check versus the stock chart itself, a way to see implied volatility for what it truly is… how options are pricing moves in the stock versus how the stock is actually trading.

**Last Week –** Markets made another outsized move last week, this time to the upside. SPY was higher by more than 6%, a significantly larger move than the 2.7% move options were pricing. That follows weekly moves of more than 5% lower the past few weeks. The majority of last week’s move higher happened on two days, Tuesday to start the week, and Friday to end the week.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.4% move for the upcoming week (about $9 in either direction), which is slightly less than last week. This week includes the end of a month and quarter for markets on Thursday (so an additional ETF expiry on Thursday) followed by a weekly expiration Friday into a 3 day Holiday weekend. So a lot of variables that options sometimes have a difficult time pricing.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 27, down from 31 the prior week. From last week’s write-up:

>the VIX was near 35 several times last week which is close to the highs the VIX has seen in earlier spikes this year (March and early May). In both those earlier cases a VIX above 35 marked a temporary low in the market.

A VIX spike to 35 once again marked a tradeable low in the markets. Prior market bounces this year ran out of steam with the VIX 19 in early April, and 23 in early June before stocks reversed lower. The VIX is still historically higher than average.

* IWM **2.8%** (+/- $5)

### In the News

One month ago we checked in on oil & gas stocks and noted that despite the stocks “crashing higher” alongside the price of oil, implied volatility in the equity options was not spiking like implied volatility in commodity options tends to. That left equity options vulnerable to underpricing a reversal in oil prices:

>For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100. Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either.  
These stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have “crashed higher” towards all-time highs alongside oil itself, but the implied volatility of options in the single names are acting more like a stock near highs and less like a volatile commodity near highs where one typically sees IV *increase* as the commodity price goes higher. Meaning Puts and Put Spreads in particular may cost less than might otherwise be expected. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge.

The commodity side of things did indeed reverse the past few weeks, to the tune of about 15% in some cases. And Occidental (OXY) and Exxon Mobile (XOM) followed suit. OXY and XOM are both down roughly 18% in the past month, even more than Oil. XOM options are pricing a move of around 20% for the rest of 2022. A move that wouldn’t even take XOM back to its highs of a few weeks ago. This is one example of how the expected move can be used as a gut check versus the stock chart itself, a way to see implied volatility for what it truly is… how options are pricing moves in the stock versus how the stock is actually trading.

### In the News

In late February, with Tesla trading near $800 I highlighted how options had been underpricing the stock’s large swings since its parabolic breakout in Oct ’21:

>*Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently. Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls. Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops.*

In the past two weeks, TSLA made a low near $760 (a double bottom from late February) and rallied with the broader market last week to close above $900 on Friday. That move to the upside was about the move options were pricing for March (with a week remaining) and implied volatility was lower on the move higher. However, the entirety of its move from $760 to nearly $910 came in the span of just a few days.

IV is lower and the stock is not seeing the large upside skew to high vol out of the money calls than it did during its moves higher at the end of 2021. Options are pricing about a 5% move this week and about 11.5% out to April 22nd:

**Quantitative Analysis**

At the time of this writing (1/9/2022), NKE  is trading at $156.97 with a 52 week range of $125.44 - $179.10 and a market cap of $248.22B.

You can view NKE’s last quarterly earnings [here](https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/FY22-Q2-Combined-NIKE-Press-Release-Schedules-FINAL.pdf) and 2021 annual report [here](https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/2021/08/NIKE_CEO_Letter_-_Shareholder_Information-Final-Proof-Website.pdf). 

**Qualitative Analysis**

Nike is the largest sportswear brand in the world, with various sectors surrounding athletics. Nike sponsors entire professional sports leagues, sports teams, and individual athletes, in nearly every sport and at nearly all levels of competition (e.g., college, professional). You’ll be hard pressed to find a sport where Nike is NOT a sponsor of an athlete or team. Nike has also become a general fashion brand, giving consumers options to choose athletic apparel, “athleisure” clothing, and even semi-formal clothing. Although many athletic events were halted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I find it hard to believe that we’ll see another complete halt anytime soon - there is far too much money involved for far too many stakeholders. As long as sports are relevant (even ESports), Nike will be a major presence.

**Bullish Thesis** 

Here are three points to support the bullish thesis:

* **Household brand:** It’s no surprise that Nike is one of the most familiar name brands in the athletic apparel industry. According to Wallstreetzen.com, Nike has more than 1,000 retail stores globally, including over 800 factory stores, 76 in-line stores, and 150 Converse stores. In 2020, Nike boasted a whopping 53% market share of the athletic footwear segment and 25% market share of the athletic apparel segment. Nike’s strong brand name, history of success, and familiarity to consumers will likely ensure it’s place near the top of the athletic apparel industry for many years to come.
* **Increasing “virtual” presence:** 2020 and 2021 drove many businesses deeper into the virtual world - particularly retailers, who were forced to adapt to economic shutdowns and slowing in-person shopping. At the end of their fiscal fourth quarter in 2021 (fiscal year ended May 31, 2021), Nike posted a quarterly revenue increase of 96% year over year to $12.3 billion and a full-year revenue increase of 19% to $44.5 billion. “This full-year growth was led by our own digital business, which has now more than doubled versus fiscal 2019 prior to the pandemic,” said CEO John Donahoe. Indeed, Nike’s direct-to-consumer digital business represented 21% of its total revenue in 2021. In addition to their shift into online, direct-to-consumer retail sales, Nike is jumping into the virtual fray via Metaverse-related acquisitions and partnerships. In December, they announced the purchase of virtual sneaker company RTFKT. Nike has also teamed up with Roblox to create a virtual world called Nikeland. Many companies - including Nike, apparently - view the metaverse as a way to reach younger consumers. Time will tell whether Nike can leverage its virtual reach into actual sales.  
* **Increased health consciousness:** Coming out of a pandemic that had particularly severe health consequences for those who were overweight or obese may cause a global shift toward increased health consciousness. There is some preliminary evidence for this trend, including multiple studies showing that COVID-19 had significant impacts on people's behaviors and attitudes toward their health and well-being. If these trends continue, it would not be surprising to see an uptick in demand for exercise equipment and athletic apparel. As a major, well-known footwear, apparel, and equipment manufacturer, Nike is incredibly well positioned to meet this increased demand.  

**Bearish Thesis**

Here are three points to support the bearish thesis:

* **Increasing competition:** For large companies this is almost a rinse and repeat argument, but Nike has seen increased competition out of multiple brands like few other sectors have seen. Nike is competing not only with the likes of Adidas and Under Armour, but also with Lululemon (who Nike recently sued over [Mirror technology](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/nike-sues-lululemon-over-mirror-home-gym-apps)) and other emerging athleisure brands. Consumers have more options and some may be searching for the newer, cooler brand to wear. Nike will always have its staying brand power, but competition forces large companies like Nike to adapt in order to stay with the trends. It also forces Nike to spend money in marketing in order to continue to be in front of consumers.
* **Continued supply chain disruptions:** For any company that produces massive amounts of products, supply chain disruptions have been a big issue since March 2020 and this issue does not seem to be going away. Supply chain issues have been a hot button topic and there has been no resolution in sight. This is made it difficult for companies like Nike to get its products to its consumers and has caused delays on releases or limiting the amount of product available for sale. This could be used by companies like Nike to increase prices in the short term but this model is not sustainable over the long term as more and more people will be moving to available products if companies like Nike cannot figure out these supply chain issues in the future.
* **Worries about China:** China has always been one of Nike’s hot countries where consumers cannot get Nike clothing and shoes fast enough, yet recently Nike’s products have sat on shelves. Nike’s recent earnings do not reflect a decrease in earnings as increased spending in other countries has helped with the decrease in China spending. Chinese consumers have spent less on foreign brands in recent years and with the supply chain worries and geo-political forces due the COVID-19 pandemic have created a nationalistic outlook for Chinese consumers. Also, workers in Xinjiang boycotted following allegations of forced labor to produce cotton giving Nike negative publicity in China. This is something for potential investors to look at as China is historically one of the biggest consumers of Nike products.",2022-01-11,7,12

We all know Nike is a great company, world leader in sporting apparel.

I pass by a Nike store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan almost every day, and there are lines outside almost every day - not just in December.,,...

But the stock trades at about 45 times earnings right now, and while it had a beat last quarter, growth simply does not warrant that multiple, in my opinion.....

Realistically, seems to be far more likely that Nike shares will decline in 2022 than rise from the current high level. May even be a short candidate.....

Implied volatility is higher than average entering a shortened holiday week and year-end. If volume falls and market moves quiet, options premium may quickly contract into three-day weekends as market makers protect against theta risk. If large day-to-day market moves continue the three-day weekend just adds to the uncertainty and options volatility could see large moves higher and lower corresponding to equity moves.

* **Globally, Nike is seeing shoppers splurge on new sneakers and fashion-forward sweatsuits to wear as more people begin to socialize again.**
* **The company’s Jordan brand has been a particular bright spot.**
* **At least 12 brokerages have already raised their price targets on Nike shares, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter release.**

[Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE) shares surged more than 14% on Friday morning, hitting a record high, after the sneaker maker [forecast full-year sales topping $50 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/nike-nke-q4-2021-earnings.html) as its North American business rebounds from the lows of the coronavirus pandemic.

**And in greater China sales appear to be improving**, with Nike management saying the company is confident about its ability to regain trust with customers there, amid threats to boycott Western brands over their comments expressing concern about alleged forced labor in Xinjiang.

“These are times when strong brands can get stronger, and each quarter this reality becomes even more clear,” Nike Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said during an earnings call Thursday evening.

**Nike’s stock was trading $152.70 at 9:35 a.m. ET. The retailer, which has a market cap of more than $211 billion, last saw its stock hit an all-time high of $147.95 on Dec. 21.**

**Globally, Nike is seeing shoppers splurge on new sneakers and fashion-forward sweatsuits to wear as more people begin to socialize again. The company’s Jordan brand has been a particular bright spot.**

**During the three-month period ended May 31, Nike’s total revenue nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from $6.31 billion a year earlier, topping Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion. In North America, Nike’s biggest market, sales more than doubled to a record $5.38 billion.**

Following Nike’s upbeat fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan raised his price target to $181 from $145. Kernan said he sees a path for the company’s market cap to one day surpass $300 billion.

“Management’s confidence is hitting an inflection and Q4 results indicate the digitally driven acceleration in the financial model,” he said in a note to clients.

According to Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández, Nike is benefiting from its closer connections with customers through its membership program, higher full price selling, greater use of data and a smarter wholesale model with strong partners like [Foot Locker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FL).

Telsey raised its price target on Nike shares to $180 from $160.

“The strong momentum in Nike’s brand globally is more than offsetting pressure in China and supply chain constraints,” Fernandez said in a note to clients.

At least 12 brokerages have already raised their price targets on Nike shares, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter release. According to FactSet, the median target price of analysts who cover the company is now $176.90.

“The company is emerging from the Covid period into the biggest \[profit and loss\] evolutions in our coverage universe,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said.

Nike warrants “a significant valuation premium” compared with other global apparel and footwear brands, he added.

m5kf6t_NKE,NKE,Is $NKE a good investment? DD,"Nike is our all American favorite sports brand but are they a good investment? Well, I’m just not sure anymore. 

Pros:

* They continue to be profitable 
* Earnings are forecast to grow 17.8% per year for the next 3 years
* Share price is relatively stable
* Revenue 38B

Cons:

* High debt acquired in 2020
* Profit margin (7.4%) is lower than last year (11.2%)
* New CEO compensation is bonkers
* Stock is overpriced possibly by 50%

Fair valuation calculations:

According to 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Valuation Model Nike is overvalued by a whopping $70 per share putting the fair value at $70.15.

PE vs Industry:

NKE is a poor value based on PE Ratio (77.6x) compared to US Luxury Industry average (26.2x)

PEG ratio: 

NKE is poor value based on a PEG of (4.4x)

PB vs Industry:

NKE is overvalued on its PB Ratio (20.8x) compared to US Luxury industry average (1.9x)

Future Growth:

17.8% which sounds decent until you compare it to the industry which is expected to grow 25.2%. Revenue growth is also projected at 9.4% while industry is at 10%. 

Past Performance:

Historical annual earnings growth is -3.3% over the last 5 years. Nike’s earnings have declined 3.3% per year over the last 5 years. Nike has had negative earnings growth over the past year, so it can’t be compared to it’s 5 year average. Nike had negative earnings growth (-38.2%) over the past year, making it difficult to compare to the Luxury industry average (-42%).

DEBT:

NKE debt is considered HIGH. Debt to Equity ratio is at a whopping (88.8%). This debt went from 15.7% in 2019 to 88.8% in 2020. This is mostly brand new debt. 

CEO Compensation:

Nike has a new CEO John Donahoe. His compensation is insane. His take home for 2020 was 54M. This is one of the highest in the world for CEO compensation. Just to give you a comparison - Tim Cook of Apple took home 12M in 2020. I also find it interesting that Donahoe ushered in this unprecedented level of company debt in the same year. 

Donahoe comes from Paypal and we all know how Paypal treats its customers. I expect to see Nike’s customer service and quality of products go downhill from here. 

A lot of people are bullish on NIKE but I just don’t see it.",2021-03-15,2,6

m51lsn_CRWD,CRWD,"Expected moves for this week. Tesla, SPY, CRWD, NKE, FDX and more.","**Market Volatility**

Last week the major indices rallied to new highs. Options were pricing in about a 2% move last week and the SPY climbed by nearly 3%. With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:

**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**

As I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.

**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices to new highs. Tesla (TSLA) was higher on the week by nearly $100. With the stock now just below $700, Tesla (TSLA) options are pricing in an expected move of about 7% for this week, down slightly from last week. Options are pricing in a roughly 15% move for the next month (to April 16th), also slightly less than last week. In other words, following last week's rally, Tesla options are pricing in less of an expected move now than they were a week ago:

**GameStop (GME).** After a wild week of moves, and the stock now near $270, options are pricing about a 30% move in either direction for this week, corresponding to roughly $185 on the downside and $350 to the upside:

Remember the expected move is simply what the options market is pricing and is best used as a consensus for bullish and bearish positioning in the market. Think of it like a point spread in a game. Those short premium need the under, those long premium are looking for the over. Before choosing strikes and positioning know that that is essentially what you are doing versus the crowd.

hr0f93_NKE,NKE,"Analysis of the four biggest sports clothing brands and which one I would invest in right now (Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Lululemon)","In this post I will be discussing the above mentioned four stocks and give my own take as to which I see as the best investment right now. Note that these companies and especially their physical stores will take massive hits as the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading across the world and forcing countries to shut down or shut down again, with another dip in their share price likely coming (then again, nobody knows that in the current market).

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
First off, the biggest of the four with a 120 billion dollar market cap, Nike (NKE). A giant of the sport's industry and partnered with some of the biggest stars and teams in sport, Nike has double the market cap of their closest competitor Adidas. They have made their name is an innovative, high quality and flexible company, able to meet changing market sentiment and make sure they hold on to their title as king of the hill.

Their share price was close to reaching new all time highs before pulling back a bit in the last few weeks. They have a lot of cash to work with but also the most debt of any company on the list, but because they also bring in the most net income and have a great revenue stream, this debt is not much of a problem for them. They are a combination of a relatively stable major cap company with enough growth potential to see rise even more in the coming years.

Current share price: $96.46
Below 52 week high: -7.76%
Above 52 week low: 53.60%
PE ratio: 60.29
Foreward PE: 39.06
EPS: 1.60
Total cash: 8.79 billion
Total debt: 13.02 billion
Net income: 4.304 billion
Share price growth past 5 years: 70.73%
Growth estimates next 5 years: 23.64%

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Second, German giant Adidas (ADDYY), coming in with a market cap of just around 50 billion dollars. After initially lagging behind their biggest rival Nike at the start of this year, they have made up ground in part because of their deal with star artist Kanye West, who's Yeezy line of shoes turned out to be a massive success. With the ever growing popularity of sneaker collecting and flipping, having these shoes in your arsenal helps a lot. Adidas is also expanding well into emerging markets like Africa and Asia, while simultaneously taking pieces of market share in North America, where Nike still rules supreme.

While their share price has recovered a decent amount since the lows seen in march, they are still trading well below all time highs and could be a good investment if you believe they will reach those highs again, which seems likely for this sportswear giant.

Current share price: €242,-
Below 52 week high: -23.43%
Above 52 week low: 44.98%
PE ratio: 34.57
Foreward PE: 69.93

Total cash: 2.68 billion
Total debt: 5.52 billion
Net income: 1.307 billion
Share price growth past 5 years: 238.65%
Growth estimates next 5 years: 21.76%

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Third, the smallest of the 4 with a market cap of around 4 billion dollars, 'new kid on the block' Under Armour (UA). Praised for the innovative clothing line and modern outlook, they have fallen down quite a bit from the heights of their 2015 highs of over 50 dollars per share. A combination of questionable management, bad investments and lack of innovative products to disrupt the market has left them struggling. The recent success of their sports face masks do show that they still got a bit of the touch that once had them talked about as a threat to Nike and Adidas, but much more is needed if they are to challenge for that title again.

As of right now, they are still trading well below their 52 week high and are struggling with negative net income and a balance sheet that is less than great. Although analysts think they will return to positive growth in the next few years, a significant tail wind is needed for this.

Current share price: $8.46
Below 52 week high: -65.31%
Above 52 week low: 22.79%
PE ratio: 58.65
Foreward PE: 88.50

Total debt: 2.24 billion
Net income: -520.019 million
Share price growth past 5 years: -79.26%
Growth estimates next 5 years: 21.80%

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Lastly, seemingly the most popular sports brand of the last 5 years, Lululemon (LULU) with a market cap of just under 40 billion dollars. Lululemon has created something of a loyaling following in the US. Where their sharp design and high quality clothing has been popular both as sports clothing as well as regular wear. They are also working on expanding into stay at home fitness, apparent from their 500 million dollar purchase of fitness start-up Mirror. The combination of brand loyalty and diversification is set to serve them well as they expand their brand outside of North America as well.

With growing net income, a good balance sheet and an amazing share growth over the past 5 years they are well positioned to come out of this crisis and thrive like they did beforehand. The only concern one could have is that their huge jump from march lows was a bit overdone and that they are due for a correction.

Current share price: $305.15
Below 52 week high: -5.74%
Above 52 week low: 119.56%
PE ratio: 69.16
Foreward PE: 74.63
EPS: 4.41
Total cash: 823.01 million
Total debt: 783.89 million
Net income: 577.625 million
Share price growth past 5 years: 344.24%
Growth estimates next 5 years: 17.53%


‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Per category:
Below 52 week high: Under Armour
Above 52 week low: Lululemon
PE ratio: Adidas
Foreward PE: Nike
EPS: Adidas
Total cash: Nike
Total debt: Lululemon 
Net income: Nike
Share price growth past 5 years: Lululemon 
Growth estimates next 5 years: Nike

‐----------------------‐----------------------------------------------
Final verdict:
Under Armour is the clear loser of these four stocks, with the worst balance sheet and net income. Yes they are trading well below their 52 week high, but that means nothing if they can't turn the ship around and become profitable again.

As for what I would pick, I have to go with Adidas as of this moment. While Nike is the biggest company in the sector and Lululemon is growing their business at an incredible rate, both of these companies have recovered greatly and given the crisis is showing no signs of stopping just yet, it could be argued they are overvalued at the moment. 

Adidas on the other is still trading well below 52 week highs, are expanding well in some of the biggest markets in the world, are less prone to US volatility since they are based in Germany and have plenty of room to run into before reaching the 120 billion dollar market cap Nike is sitting at. Will they reach this? Only time can tell, but they are doing all the right things and they are (in my opinion) the best investment of these four sportswear giants.

Are you invested into one of these companies or do you think one of the other picks is a better investment, leave a comment and let's discuss it.",2020-07-14,22,23
hg1avc_NKE,NKE,Nike posts surprise loss as COVID-19 hits wholesale business,"(Reuters) - Nike Inc (NKE.N) on Thursday reported an unexpected quarterly loss - its first in more than two years - hurt by closures of department and retail stores due to lockdowns spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

FILE PHOTO: A silhouette of a woman wearing a protective face shield and a protective face mask is seen near a Nike logo at a shopping mall on the first day after the government eased restrictions amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Jakarta, Indonesia, June 15, 2020. REUTERS/Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana
The footwear maker’s shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading.

The wholesale business, through which Nike sells merchandise to other retailers, came to a halt amid the health crisis. That led to a 50% fall in shipments, increased inventory and higher costs due to order cancellations.

As a result, gross margin fell 820 basis points in the fourth quarter, when company-owned stores and other retailers were closed for nearly eight weeks.

However, Nike’s investments in its digital platform over the years helped it record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear and sneakers from the comfort of their homes.

Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts the company is now accelerating focus on its online presence, and expects its overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. Online sales accounted for 30% of total revenue in the quarter.

“COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound,” Donahoe said.

In China, where the virus was first detected, all of Nike’s stores are now open. Revenue fell 3% in the Greater China region, while they plunged nearly 47% in North America.

Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali said the Nike brand is still strong and China sales number is an indicator of what to expect in western markets and the United States as things normalize.

“It’s not financially distressed ... It does not have the problems of other companies in retail.”

Nike’s net loss came in at 51 cents per share and revenue fell 38% to $6.31 billion.

Wall Street was expecting a profit of 7 cents per share and revenue of $7.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Conclusion for today’s Analysis: Price closing above the September 21, 2018 high of $85.98 indicates resumption of the bullish trend in Nike.

Over a year and 2 months of price action is covered in today’s Nike stock analysis using a 6 hour timeframe. The previous bullish price channel lasting over 11 months was broken to the downside, with price retracing to \~$66.45.

&#x200B;

[Nike Inc. (NKE) 6 hour timeframe chart](https://i2.wp.com/coinanalyst.investments/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chart-TEMPLATE-9.png?ssl=1)

Bullish momentum resulting from the above mentioned price level is yet to break above the previous high of $85.98 reached on September 21, 2018, therefore implying patience on entry of any long (buy) position that will be considered very conservative.

$60.55 is used as the lower price level for support indicated on the chart with the upper boundary being $66.45. A break below $60.55 in this case indicates resumption of the sell off from September 21, 2018, with lower prices to be expected.

A bearish channel (tentative) drawn on the chart needs to be monitored if Nike does indeed fail to close above price high of $80.96 established on Friday, the 18th of January, 2019",2019-01-19,0,3

9l5z5s_NKE,NKE,Chart pros please! Advice needed on AMZN and NKE.,"Off a technically chart analysis, how does AMZN and NKE look in the immediate short-term?

Looks like AMZN may break or touch its 50 day MA of $1919 before it moves higher? I bought in at $1941. I was buying to hold but decided to go back to my original idea of day trading it (no overnight risk). Sell now at a small profit (hoping it holds on the open tomorrow morning)? Overall AMZNs chart looks like it’s cooling down. Could be wrong though.

NKE, same story there. Could’ve gotten out of it Monday or Tuesday for a nice gain but couldn’t due to a holiday. So I’m down on the stock 2.5% currently, but with a decent amount of money it’s definitely not a loss I want to take unnecessarily. How does NKEs chart look? I like it’s chart a bit better than AMZN tbh, but I’m no pro.

9jygjz_NKE,NKE,Postmortem of a Successful Nike Earnings Trade (Long Post),"Hello r/options!  As I have learned more about options, I have started to make some more sophisticated trades.  I recently made a trade on Nike earnings that worked out very well, but I made some execution-related mistakes that left some money on the table.  I did see there was another thread with a similar trade, but I think I go a little more in depth about how I evaluated the trade before I placed it.  I’m hoping to get some tips and feedback on my thought process and approach.  In particular, if there are any risks that I did not consider or alternative trades I could have used I would love to hear about that.  

I selected Nike for a few reasons.  First, there are not a lot of companies reporting earnings right now, so I figured Nike would get a lot of attention which would boost option prices.  Second, there has been a lot of press regarding Nike’s Colin Kaepernick ad campaign, but I think people did not realize that the campaign only started in September.  I figured people would buy options on the expectation that the earnings call would provide some indication about whether the campaign was successful or not.  But there simply has not been enough time to know what the impact will be; Nike doesn’t even know if it has worked out yet.  For these reasons I thought that near term options would be overpriced – the market would expect a larger move in the stock than would actually occur, and I wanted to set up a trade that would profit from IV crush.  So, I had the idea to sell a straddle in the near term and buy a straddle or a strangle in a later month on the basis that they would have an IV discrepancy that would equalize after earnings.  I think this is technically a double diagonal spread, but I have also heard it called a straddle-strangle swap.  

I noticed the NKE $85 9/28 straddle was trading for about $4.60-4.70 with an IV of 60-65%.  I took 85% of the straddle price as a “rule of thumb” about how far the market expected the stock to move, which yielded a range of $81 to $88.  

Next, I looked at straddles and near the money strangles in a couple November expirations.  I noticed they were trading at an IV of about 25-26% and historically the IV had gone as low as 10-15% on similar options.  I was worried about the back month IV also crushing down and wiping out my profits.  

I used the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to set up a spreadsheet that made a grid of what my profit would be at expiration across a range of underlying prices versus post-earnings IVs.  I used the historical IV info and the expected movement range from the straddle to create a “target area” where I thought the position would end up.  Then I tinkered with strikes and expirations to try to find the best trade.  I assumed that each grid square in my target area was equally likely and tried to estimate an expected value.  

At first, I sold the NKE $85 9/28 straddle and bought the NKE $85 11/16 straddle.  Later, I rolled the back month straddle into a NKE $84 - $86 11/2 strangle because it had a higher potential profit.  Originally, I didn’t want to have a margin requirement, but later I decided it was worth the risk.  Regardless, I ended up with a short straddle and a long strangle for a $0.57 debit with a $2.00 margin requirement although my max loss was only $1.57 at the short expiration.  

After the Nike earnings call on Tuesday, I was ecstatic.  In after hours, the price dropped to about $82 a share and I was certain it would rally at the open and the trade would be a winner.  Even at $82, as long as the IV didn’t drop below 20% it would still be a winner.  I ended up closing the position on Wednesday morning for $1.50 per share, for a cool 164% profit.  

One of the mistakes I made was that I closed the trade too early.  If I had held on until yesterday, in theory I could have maximized profit and sold somewhere in the $2.75 to $2.95 range for 400%+ profit.  But it was hard to not lock in the profits when I saw them.  

In the future, I am going to do a few things differently.  First, I will consider selling a narrow strangle rather than the straddle, so that I have a chance to pin the underlying between the short strikes and have them both expire worthless.  Then I can sell (or not) either of the long legs at my discretion.  Second, I am going to come up with more specific exit criteria so that I can be a little more objective in my decision about when to exit.  

What do you think about my trade?  Is there anything you would have done differently?  The book “Options as a Strategic Investment” has been super helpful to me, would recommend it to anyone who wants to step their game up.  

Cheers,

Dot",2018-09-29,25,14

I'm okay with taking profits with anything over 30% at this time. I have some free trades on Fidelity so that's been helpful for learning. 

Sold a NKE 8/31 covered call at 79 for $1.03 premium on 7/24. My cost basis for the shares were 53.56 (bought over final 3 months of 2016). I'm am interested in exiting NKE by year-end to lock in my profits from holding and rebalance my portfolio.

I know there isn't that much open interest (noob mistake). NKE did a run-up recently. EMA 9, 20, and 55 are all trending upwards. I'm currently at a loss since the contract is 2.56 to buy back.

Was thinking of doing the following:

\- Waiting this week to see if NKE pulls back below the strike.

\- If it doesn't, buying back the call and then rolling out to 10/19 at 80 for 3.70.

If I got $1.03 premium and bought it back today, i'd be in debit at -1.53, then selling the 10/19 at 80 for 3.70 would bring me to 2.17 for premium and increase max profit up $100 due to the raised strike price.

8uthqj_NKE,NKE,Nike shares surge 12% to record high after sales top estimates and retailer sees 'return to growth' in US,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/nike-sales-top-estimates-as-retailer-sees-return-to-growth-in-us.html)

[Nike](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=NKE)  on Thursday reported earnings and sales that topped analysts'  expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter and announced a new,  four-year $15 billion share repurchase program.

The company said it saw a  ""return to growth in North America,"" which has lately been a sluggish  spot for sales following a handful of retail bankruptcies. Revenues,  meanwhile, were up double digits in international markets during the  latest period, as Nike reaped the benefits of a handful of new product  launches.

Nike shares jumped nearly 12 percent to an all-time high on Friday following the news.

The Oregon-based retailer  reported net income of $1.1 billion, or 69 cents per share, for the  quarter ended May 31, compared with $1 billion, or 60 cents a share, a  year ago. Excluding one-time items, Nike earned 69 cents a share, 5  cents ahead of analysts' expectations, based on a Thomson Reuters  survey.

Total sales climbed 13  percent to $9.8 billion, again ahead of a forecast by the Street for  $9.4 billion. Nike said its digital business alone was up 41 percent  during the quarter.

""Fueled by a complete  digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the  foundation for NIKE's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and  profitability,"" CEO Mark Parker said in a statement.

Part of Nike's latest  strategy to win back sales in the U.S. includes selling more directly to  consumers (thereby improving gross margins), making bigger investments  in women's footwear and apparel, piloting a test with [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) to rid the marketplace of counterfeit goods, and partnering with subscription service [Stitch Fix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SFIX).

Nike has also been  focused on adding experiences to stores and scaling new merchandise. A  new React cushioning technology in its sneakers has been one big hit,  for example.

Nike's business — much  like that of its peers in the athletic footwear and apparel industry —  has been particularly stronger outside of North America of late. In  areas such as Greater China, for example, there's still more room to  grow. Retail bankruptcies in the U.S. (i.e., Sports Authority and  Golfsmith) have been disruptive for companies such as Nike, [Under Armour](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAA) and Adidas.

During the latest  quarter, Nike said sales excluding currency changes climbed 3 percent in  North America, 10 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 25  percent in Greater China, and 13 percent in Asia Pacific and Latin  America. Footwear sales were up 8 percent overall, apparel sales climbed  15 percent, while equipment sales dipped 3 percent.

""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies,"" Parker said.

Nike has been embroiled  in a #MeToo moment, with several senior male employees leaving abruptly  or set to leave Nike later this year, including brand President Trevor  Edwards. Edwards was expected to be the next CEO in line after Parker  finished his term, but he will now retire officially in August amid  complaints about his poor workplace conduct.

Parker has since  apologized to Nike employees in an internal memo for allowing a  corporate culture at Nike that excluded some workers and for failing to  take complaints about workplace issues more seriously, [sources familiar told The Wall Street Journal in May](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-ceo-apologizes-for-corporate-culture-that-excluded-some-staff-1525399012).

Nike's chief of human  resources, Monique Matheson, has also since said that Nike will make  changes to ensure women and minorities are better represented in top  jobs at the company.

Wall Street hasn't been  as rattled by the #MeToo developments at Nike. Some industry analysts  have applauded Nike's efforts to conduct a sweeping internal review of  personnel before the situation worsened.

""We are encouraged that  the Company is embracing change; both culturally and with progressive go  to market strategies,"" Stifel analyst Jim Duffy said. ""Against this  backdrop, we expect the Company shows strong evidence of firming  fundamentals that make more tangible capacity for the long-term  objective high-single digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth.""

Looking to the future,  Nike is more upbeat about fiscal 2019, building on the latest momentum  within the U.S. It hiked its sales outlook Thursday and now expects  revenues to increase a high-single-digit percentage rate, up from a  mid-to-high range.

As of Thursday's market  close, shares of Nike are up more than 34 percent so far this year,  trading around $72 apiece. The company has a market capitalization of  roughly $115.6 billion.",2018-06-29,369,26

7jtixl_NKE,NKE,Thoughts on $NKE,"This is another one I've been eyeing for a potential trade and took today as a put-buying opportunity. I went for January $65's.

Given the recent run in this stock with very few down days in the past month, I think there is just way too much positive sentiment here and this is a decent risk/reward opportunity.

I see a number of red flags ahead of next weeks earnings.

* This run-up began on the back of Foot Locker's beat last month and has only gained momentum since, so an earnings beat is already priced in to some extent.
* Related to the above point, just today an analyst slapped a $75 price target on the stock, so again, an expected earnings beat is already priced into this stock, IMO. In other words, this stock is priced for perfection ahead of earnings and I don't think it has much more upside barring a huge beat which I think is very unlikely.
* We've seen huge misses by Dick's and UAA recently which I think could possibly be a bad sign for Nike's earnings.
* Nike has tried to go for volume, striking a deal with Amazon earlier this year to sell its wares on that site, effectively further diminishing brand equity and pricing power and signaling some desperation. I also hate this strategy, personally.
* The 80's are over. This is a company with a $115 bn market cap playing in one of the most hotly-contested markets in the world, so I think if not now, very soon the stock is going to reverse on a long-term downtrend.

Sooo, I think they could beat estimates due to increased consumer spending and still take a tumble post-earnings because so much positivity is already priced in. I also don't think the options market is adequately pricing the probability of an earnings miss or the volatility that would follow. I chose to buy today because the stock is up again on the back of the aforementioned analyst PT and I fear that there might be some profit-taking next week ahead of earnings as investors get the jitters. If it continues up into earnings I may add to this position. This is admittedly a very risky play given the number of retail beats recently.",2017-12-14,2,3

When Foot Locker ($FL) beat earnings in Q4, they saw an 8% rise in share price, and even cited high demand for Nike shoes as a reason. And idk if anyone noticed but basketball has become MUCH more popular over the past year and I think it will continue to grow, thus growing the demand for Nike. Nike's not going anywhere anytime soon. 

Hell I haven't bought anything from Nike in years and even I picked up a pair of Roshe's around the holiday season. I currently have 13 shares @57.52 average, 5x April 21st $65 C, and 2x June 16th $65 C. If anyone wants proof of this small position I'd be happy to share but I didn't think anyone would give a shit since this isn't a yolo or anything. 

**TLDR:** Buy Nike going into earnings next Tuesday and even if I'm wrong, it's a light bag to hold. ",2017-03-16,23,6

It was a medium size bet too for me. I should have went small. But the question is, today after earnings release the stock went up by very little and I can understand my 50.50 puts dropped 90% and are next to worthless now.

What I don't understand is, why the calls @ 50.50 are down 20% too? Is it because of supply and demand? Even for expiration out at January 27th, the calls are still down when the stock rose a little. So pretty much I learned the lesson of not buying options during earnings time because it seems like you can't win either way here. Thanks for clarifying. ",2016-12-21,6,5

# Description
NIKE, Inc. is engaged in the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Its portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. They've also done a pretty good job expanding their brand into the digital area, though more for branding than revenues.

## Recent financials 

Looking at the financials, could say: They Did It! And that's despite the strong dollar dampening the results in the year to May 2016.

|May-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $32bn | $31bn | $28bn | $25bn | $23bn|
|EPS | $2.16 | $1.85 | $1.49 | $1.34 | $1.20|
|Dividend | $0.62 | $0.54 | $0.47 | $0.41 | $0.35|

## Competition

In their annual they compare themselves to: 

> adidas, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, V.F. Corporation and Under Armour

And they suggest investors compare their stock to:

> The Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index including Deckers Outdoor Corp., Wolverine World Wide, Inc., Skechers U.S.A., Inc. and Steven Madden, Ltd.
> The Standard & Poor’s Apparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods Index consists of V.F. Corporation, Coach, Inc., Ralph Lauren Corporation, Under Armour, Inc. and Michael Kors Holdings

Their margin compares well. And their returns are impressive. Seems to indicate a well run machine! Only Michael Kors is an  outlier.

## Cash / Debt?

With $2,728M of net cash, equivalent of 3% of its market value, it's no wonder Nike's got a large share buyback program.

They used up their old $8bn authorisation earlier this year, and started into their new $12 billion authorisation! In the last quarter alone they bought $1bn of stock at an average price of $59.

> We intend to use excess cash, future cash from operations and/or proceeds from debt to fund repurchases under the share repurchase program.

# Wall Street thinks?

So, it's no surprise that the professionals on Wall Street have a $63.77 for Nike Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 22% to their target.

# Valuation

Though that target would push the stock to an even greater premium that it's on today. UA and LULU are at higher levels and expected to grow faster, but at 22x we have to admit that NKE's priced as a ""High Quality"" stock.

# Dividends

Nike Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.69 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.62 per share. That is a 11% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.69 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.38.

Again, no wonder there are big buybacks in the pipeline.

# Taxes

There have been some folks complaining about taxes recently. And it is fair to say that NKE's tax rates declined from 24% to 22% to 19% in the last 3 years. But just because the growth is outside the US, and they aren't re-patriating the cash, is that a reason to be a bear?

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%. So no real move there.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, this week

> Our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance, high single digit reported revenue growth and high single to low double-digit currency neutral revenue growth. 

So it's steady as she goes, the dollar and economy willing!

# Governance

Last but not least, we need to think about the Founder Mr Knight. He controls the company via the Class A shares. 

> As of June 30, 2016, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2016, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. 

Now it's highly unlikely that these shares will hit the market. I'm more concerned by the the existence of a dual class structure. It's just a thing that I hate! 

Though remember, the baton has passed.. 

> Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director, Travis Knight.

For now, like with FB and GOOGL, I'm not concerned, but it's a flag to keep a watch on Travis! 

In the meantime, let's focus on the cashflow... which is all looking good.

Also Nike pays dividends and UA doesn't pay dividends. Nike also had a 2:1 split I think about 1 year ago. So even if you say, ""Oh, Nike only pays like a dollar in dividends every year."" With only 100 shares in Nike after a 2:1 split equals 200 dollars in dividends alone. I'm all for UA and I hope they succeed as a company as they have had a rough 2 years. But you have got to look at the sheer size of the market and when Nike's shares cost around 50 a share and UA costs around 37 a share and Nike has handsome dividends and UA has no dividends and Nike has had a 2:1 split in the last year,; I mean as an investor.... you gotta keep emotion out of decisions.

35nff5_NKE,NKE,"NKE, UA, or SKX?","Trying to decide on which one to buy... NKE is an internationally known brand (and has been for quite awhile).. It has a P/E of ~29, a beta of .77, and has shown steady growth. UA has a rather high P/E of ~84, a beta of .85 and also shows decent growth. SKX has a reasonable beta of ~31, a beta of .58, and seems to be making a rather large comeback and are apparently very popular in Europe. 

YTD performance: NKE- 6.91% UA- 15.25% SKX- 80.29%",2015-05-11,2,6
2zmeox_NKE,NKE,Question about NKE earnings plays.,"If I theoretically sold an IC in NKE and the earnings caused the stock to move hard against me, could the put or call I sold in my IC get exercised for the full price of the stock? Meaning would I have to pay 10 grand if one of those options went bad and I had to fulfill my obligation? Or do the calls and puts I would have bought protect me from that somehow?",2015-03-19,1,4
2v0q79_NKE,NKE,Athleisure Discussion/Speculation : NKE vs UA vs ADDYY,"With the exception of Adidas, the ""athleisure"" sector had an amazing 2014 with lots of different stories. This is an exciting area to me and I wanted to speculate on where it might be headed. Disclaimer - this post will be almost entirely speculation so turn around now if you don't want to join in.

Nike:

* Impressive growth in areas they already dominate (basketball, running, etc)
* Increasing profit margins with more direct to consumer sales
* Slight drag due to foreign exchange rates, dollar doesn't seem to be getting any weaker in the near term.
- Killed their fuelband/wearables for now, seems likely that they will take Apple's lead into the future.
- Top notch design over the last few years, really innovated what a running shoe looks like (seriously compare the asics lineup with the nike flyknit lineup), innovative tech over the years such as air, flywire, flyknit - its easy to see that the rest of industry is chasing them in this regard.

UA:

* One of the best stocks of 2014, amazing growth story, where do we go from here?
* Growth has been explosive in the US, but will they be able to convert a European Adidas fan or a Nike fan in Asia?
* To go with the above point, they are very focused in Football right now, practically non-existent in soccer though, lagging far behind in baseball and basketball as well (although they are extremely lucky to have Steph Curry, pretty much guaranteed MVP this year). Soccer seems like a long shot for them, Basketball growth seems more likely but they need to develop brands with their stars. Jordan, Kobe, Lebron, KD - all have huge brands cultivated under Nike and any future megastar is going to want the same. Steph curry just got his first signature shoe. Long way to go.
* Purchased MyFitnessPal and Endomondo - building a very exciting, OS agnostic fitness platform with impressive user numbers already. Great move, but are they really going to come out ahead of NKE here? Nike and Apple are very close, Tim Cook sits on the Nike board, Apple looks to have a dominant position in wearables before even releasing their watch, this duo will be a dominant force in health and fitness tracking.
* What are they doing now that really sets them apart? I don't deny the brand is extremely hot, but where are they setting themselves apart instead of copying Nike? Before the fitness app purchases I haven't seen anything unique yet.

Adidas:

* Slaughtered this year, exchange rates really hurt, World Cup not giving the boost they wanted, EU and Russia really dragging them down.
* CEO admits mistakes, vows to spend a huge amount of money signing hundreds of athletes and advertising heavily in the US this year.
* Top Nike designers jumping ship and joining Adidas, as well as big signings outside of athletics - Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, etc. Say what you want about Kanye, but he is arguably the most well known person in the world designing shoes and apparel right now, his work with NKE sold out instantly and was highly coveted. His work with Adidas will have a much more broad reach, we'll see how those numbers might translate on the balance sheet soon. Adidas also has a long history collaborating with other fashion designers (same with Nike), whereas UA has nothing like this that I've seen.

I have long positions in NKE and AAPL so that's what I'm betting on here, but I'm thinking about buying some ADDYY because of how badly they've been beaten down. I think the brand is still very strong all over the world and is poised for a comeback, although maybe not immediate due to the high price tag they may pay in the short term to earn back that market share. I like UA, but I'm not convinced that the next couple years will be so great, in line with their recent guidance downgrade.

What are your thoughts? How does LULU play into all of this? How will the sector as a whole perform this year?",2015-02-06,1,2
