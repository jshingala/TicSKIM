oje95t_NOC,NOC,NASA signs $1bn deal with Northrop Grumman to build studio apartment in lunar orbit with room for 3 vehicles,"NOC to the moon...literally! Here's the first few paragraphs of a longer article...the first apartment in space, AND it will have a 3-car garage

 *NASA* [*has inked a $935m contract*](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-northrop-grumman-finalize-moon-outpost-living-quarters-contract) *with Northrop Grumman to build the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module for the Lunar Gateway.*

*The contract will also require the aerospace outfit to integrate the module with the power and propulsion element being built by Maxar Technologies.*

*HALO will be both a crew habitat and, with three docking ports, a hub for visiting spacecraft. Derived from Northrop Grumman's Cygnus freighter, used to ferry cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), it won't be the most expansive of pressurised spaces (certainly when compared to the ISS) although will be expandable via additional modules (including the International Habitation Module –* [*slated for launch in 2026*](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/space/press-release/thales-alenia-space-its-way-reach-moon)*).*

 *The module will also play host to NASA's Orion spacecraft, lunar landers, and logistics vehicles. NASA described the size as about that of a ""small studio apartment"" when it awarded Northrop Grumman with a* [*$187m contract to design the module in 2020*](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-northrop-grumman-artemis-contract-for-gateway-crew-cabin)*.*

I know defense contractors don't typically get a lot of love around here but this struck me as a good way for a company of this size (97,000 employees, something like $30bln rev) to take it to the next level, in more ways than one.

NOTE: I don't hold any positions in NOC, but this could be a way for me to expand my horizons a bit (see what I did there?)",2021-07-13,159,30

I'm talking about companies like RTX, LMT and NOC. We can assume that they are developing aircraft, weapons systems and tech that we, the public, cannot possibly know about yet for reasons of national security. 

We can also assume that there are already multiple weapons systems that have ALREADY been developed that we have no, or limited knowledge of. We know, for example, that Northrop is developing the B-21 Raider, which will be the new heavy stealth bomber for the USAF. What we know about this aircraft and contract is limited, but NOC will already be earning from this, in the form of funding, before the completion and delivery of said aircraft.

My question is, do these companies report earnings from confidential government contracts & projects in quarterly statements?",2020-07-04,5,3

>Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) is a leader in aerospace defense contracts and development of cybersecurity. This company has the eyes of many investors thanks to a strong history of beating analyst projections. While Trump tweets and tariffs harm most companies, Northrop has shown they can move around in the hardest political environments thrown at them. While their stock has recently gotten weaker, the company may still be quite promising.
