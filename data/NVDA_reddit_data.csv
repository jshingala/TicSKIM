NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.

Earnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

Nvidia‚Äôs Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I‚Äôm not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle,¬†**either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I‚Äôm sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects ‚Äì it‚Äôs business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime**¬†opportunity, and for once it‚Äôs not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia‚Äôs is a supply problem ‚Äì and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it.¬†

Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**‚ÄúOur data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,‚Äù Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the ‚Äúunprecedented explosive token growth‚Äù commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**‚ÄúEvery hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,‚Äù Moore explained. ‚ÄúBut our conviction is not driven by that, it‚Äôs driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.‚Äù**

Moore continued: ‚ÄúThis is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists;¬†**this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,**¬†which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up.¬†**The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.**¬†We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.‚Äù

Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom.

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

1kven6n_NVDA,NVDA,Oracle to spend $40 billion on Nvidia chips for OpenAI data center - FT,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) plans to invest approximately $40 billion in high-performance chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power OpenAI‚Äôs new AI-focused data center in Texas, according to a report from The Financial Times. The move underscores the accelerating arms race among tech giants to secure the infrastructure needed to support next-generation artificial intelligence models.

The facility, located in Abilene, Texas, is part of a $500 billion initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank Group. As the first Stargate U.S. site, the data center is expected to support 1.2 gigawatts of computing power when fully operational by mid-2026.

Oracle intends to acquire roughly 400,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs GB200 chips, the company‚Äôs most advanced processors for AI training and inference. Rather than operate the center directly, Oracle will lease the computing capacity to OpenAI under a reported 15-year agreement.

The Texas site will be among the world‚Äôs largest when completed, solidifying both Oracle‚Äôs and OpenAI‚Äôs ambitions in large-scale infrastructure.

The announcement follows a separate collaboration unveiled this week between the three companies, alongside G42, SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), to build Stargate UAE, a 1-gigawatt AI cluster headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The UAE facility will be housed within the larger UAE‚ÄìU.S. AI Campus and is designed to support global-scale AI advancement across industries.

As chip demand surges, Oracle‚Äôs multi-year investment signals confidence not only in Nvidia‚Äôs hardware but also in OpenAI‚Äôs ability to lead the next era of compute-intensive applications. ‚ÄúAI is the most transformative force of our time,‚Äù said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week. ‚ÄúWith Stargate, we are building the infrastructure to power the future.""",2025-05-25,88,20
1kv4ikx_NVDA,NVDA,"Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week","Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.



On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.



In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.



The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.



Tariff escalation

President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.



But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.



""Safe to say for the time being we‚Äôve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.""



Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.



This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.



The AI leader reports

Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.



Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.



Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.



Price check

Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.



A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual ""core"" PCE ‚Äî which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy ‚Äî to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",2025-05-25,93,46

1kvfdbt_NVDA,NVDA,Is NVDA Entering Value Territory Before Earnings?,"I wouldn‚Äôt have asked this question two years ago. But after reviewing NVIDIA‚Äôs FY2025 financials and walking through a simple valuation based on projected free cash flow, I‚Äôm starting to believe that NVIDIA is entering territory where long-term value investors should take a closer look.

NVIDIA generated $130.5B in revenue in FY2025 and $72.9B in GAAP net income. Free cash flow came in at $60.85B, up 125% year-over-year. Gross margin was approximately 75%.

They also returned over $33B to shareholders through buybacks and still ended the year with $43.2B in cash.

And yet, NVIDIA is trading at:

* 45x trailing earnings
* 31x forward earnings
* A PEG ratio of roughly 0.68

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù in a traditional sense of a railway or consumer segment, but NVDA isn't one.

**Simple, Conservative Valuation**

In our thesis, we ran a very basic valuation check using these assumptions:

* 25% revenue CAGR through 2030 (extremely conservative given recent numbers)
* Free cash flow margins between 45‚Äì50%
* A 35-50x multiple applied to 2030 free cash flow (extremely in line historically)

Under that setup, NVIDIA would produce over $180B in free cash flow annually by 2030, and applying that 35-50x multiple gives you an estimated valuation in the $6‚Äì9 trillion range.

This isn‚Äôt a complicated DCF and we consider it a conservative leaning base case. NVDA could blow past a 25% revenue rate over the next 5 years.

* The article suggests a possible breakout setup ahead of earnings (reporting May 22).
* It‚Äôs been trading in a very tight range ‚Äî classic behavior before a move?
* Fund ownership and institutional interest remain strong.

(Bloomberg) ‚Äî The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China‚Äôs hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world‚Äôs second largest economy.

‚ÄúWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,‚Äù Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they‚Äôre physically inside‚Äù the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang‚Äôs view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created ‚ÄúGPU haves and GPU have nots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,‚Äù Krishnan said. ‚ÄúOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.‚Äù

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. ‚ÄúChina has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI developers, and it‚Äôs important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,‚Äù he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump‚Äôs trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies‚Äô access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

‚ÄúThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,‚Äù said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. ‚ÄúMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.‚Äù",2025-05-21,31,6

1krh3sj_GOOGL,GOOGL,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk¬†said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants¬†Nvidia¬†and¬†AMD, and possibly others.

Musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the¬†Tesla¬†CEO told CNBC‚Äôs David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said.¬†

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

‚ÄúA few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,‚Äù he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of¬†Tesla.

At his autos business,¬†Musk said Tesla‚Äôs Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI‚Äôs Colossus is the ‚Äúmost powerful training cluster in the world right now‚Äù with ‚Äúover 200,000 GPUs training coherently.‚Äù Musk‚Äôs choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as¬†transforming¬†the region¬†into a ‚Äúhigh-tech manufacturing hub.‚Äù

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously¬†reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely ‚Äúviolated the Clean Air Act‚Äù and local permitting requirements for ‚Äúmajor sources of air pollution‚Äù with its use of the turbines.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government‚Äôs latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively¬†banned¬†Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

‚ÄúThis additional ban on Nvidia‚Äôs H20 is deeply painful,‚Äù Huang¬†said¬†in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. ‚ÄúWe walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably‚Äîwhat is it? ‚Äî $3 billion worth of taxes‚Äù for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia‚Äôs artificial-intelligence chips to China‚Äîeven one or two generations old‚Äîcan help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei‚Äôs AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei‚Äôs chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia‚Äôs current CUDA software advantage could erode.

‚ÄúAnybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we‚Äôre not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they‚Äôre not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.‚Äù

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia‚Äôs products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",2025-05-19,582,65

Huang‚Äôs keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei‚Äôs Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia‚Äôs latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker‚Äôs stock were little changed Friday. They‚Äôve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year‚Äôs Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

1knkj8u_NVDA,NVDA,A Word of Warning for Anyone Trading NVDA Around Earnings,"Hello fellow traders! As you all may be aware, NVDA has had a great bull run and lots of positive news recently, bouncing back from the China ban. As of now, it looks healthily poised to break through its previous 2025 highs before it started dipping (tarrifs, liberation day, you know‚Ä¶)



With its hot streak, it is now approaching its Q2 earnings on May 28, and there‚Äôs a lot of positive sentiment around it. Unfortunately, it also can be a trap for traders who aren‚Äôt prepared. I wanted to drop a quick breakdown for newer traders or those eyeing short-term profits around its earnings based on historical data:



**Since its meteoric rise from \~30 a stock in 2023, NVDA stock has had a tendency to tank DESPITE positive earnings.** I won‚Äôt bore you with the exact details, but just take a look at the feb 26 Q1 earnings: despite beating analyst estimates, the stock tanked 8%.



So why does this happen? It‚Äôs not unique to NVDA ‚Äî plenty of high-flying stocks like AAPL, AMD, and even MSFT have seen post-earnings selloffs despite strong beats. One key reason is **expectations premium** ‚Äî the stock often rallies into earnings, pricing in the good news ahead of time. Once the report hits, **institutional players use the post-earnings euphoria to offload positions into strength**, especially if there's a lack of fresh upside guidance. On top of that, **implied volatility tends to be heavily elevated going into earnings**, and the subsequent **IV crush** can pressure options-driven flows. If there‚Äôs excessive call buying beforehand, **dealers may unwind hedges** post-earnings, adding to downside pressure. Combine that with any weakness in the broader risk-on environment, and you‚Äôve got a perfect storm for a fade ‚Äî even on great numbers.



That said, should you short it around earnings given this pattern? I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it ‚Äî not from a macro strategy standpoint. NVDA remains structurally strong, both in fundamentals and narrative, and even if it dips post-earnings, it has consistently found buyers and resumed its uptrend within days or weeks. **Shorting a stock like this is essentially trying to time a temporary pullback in a long-term uptrend ‚Äî not a strategy with favorable risk-reward**. Even if you're right directionally, the challenge is in timing your exit perfectly (unless you‚Äôre satisfied with small scalps). **These dips are often sharp but short-lived**, and overstaying can easily turn a green trade into a loss. Plus, **IV is already elevated**, so unless the move is immediate and sustained, you‚Äôre likely to see option premiums decay fast. In a name with strong institutional backing and a dominant position in AI, short setups rarely play out cleanly ‚Äî and when they fail, they fail hard.



**TLDR**: The most consistent strategy for NVDA is to stay flat through earnings and let the post-report structure develop. Outside of macro catalysts and earnings volatility, NVDA tends to respect technical levels and trend cleanly, making it highly tradeable on both swing and intraday timeframes. Trying to catch the initial earnings reaction often exposes you to poor R:R and unstable flow. Waiting for the volatility to unwind allows you to position with much better clarity, whether you're looking to ride a continuation or fade a failed breakout. You already have a highly liquid, consistent stock with great promise and future prospects - don‚Äôt be greedy and try to make big moves around events - you don‚Äôt need them to profit consistently.

1kmn7ul_NVDA,NVDA,Nvidia shares hit new highs: benefiting from Saudi Arabia's multi-billion dollar AI chip investment plan; the US plans to revoke the Biden administration's chip restrictions,,2025-05-14,6,19
1kmfxo2_NVDA,NVDA,"Saudi Arabia plans to spend billions of dollars on AI chips, U.S. to revoke Biden's chip restrictions, NVIDIA shares extend gains","Shares of NVIDIA ( NVDA ) were up 3.6% in early trading Wednesday, extending the previous day's gains when shares were up nearly 6% and the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since February.

Shares were pushed higher on Tuesday after U.S. chipmakers, including NVIDIA, announced deals worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia at an investment forum attended by President Donald Trump.

NVIDIA said it would supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips over the next five years to Saudi Arabia's AI joint venture, Humain, starting with the sale of one of its newest Grace Blackwell AI supercomputers, which will use 18,000 of NVIDIA's advanced GB300 chips.Humain is a new AI joint venture that Owned by Saudi Arabia's $925 billion public investment fund and chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the company was officially launched the day before Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia.

Bank of America ( BAC ) analysts estimated the total value of the deal at $7 billion and raised their price target on Nvidia stock to $160 from $150 in a report to investors Wednesday morning.

Nvidia's shares were also boosted by a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that suggested the Trump administration could strike a deal that would allow the United Arab Emirates to buy ‚Äúmore than a million‚Äù of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

U.S. chipmakers SuperMicro Semiconductor (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also announced a deal to supply Humain with chips for its ambitious AI data center plans over the next few years.AMD's deal is worth $10 billion.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the news bodes well for demand for AI hardware.

In a report to investors earlier Wednesday, he wrote: ‚ÄúFor investors concerned about the sustainability of AI capex, we now have another financially strong client willing and able to invest heavily in a clear strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub. ‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile we still need to see how much of the announced plan can actually be implemented, Tuesday's action is likely to be supportive in easing concerns about peak capital spending.‚Äù

Investors have been scrutinizing the ability of large U.S. tech companies to sustain unprecedented levels of spending on AI infrastructure while they continue to work on ways to fully monetize their AI products.

Additionally, Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), a server maker that uses NVIDIA's AI chips and server designs, announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt. The stock is closely tied to NVIDIA's moves, rising 16% on Tuesday and another 18% in early trading Wednesday.

Previously, Saudi Arabia and President Trump had announced a $600 billion deal that would allow the Saudis and their U.S.-based companies to buy U.S. technology, weapons and infrastructure. But so far, the investments announced Tuesday total well below $600 billion.

Shares of NVIDIA rose on Wednesday, pushing its stock price one step closer to 2025 upside territory after months of turmoil. As of Tuesday's close, shares were down 3 percent so far this year.

The artificial intelligence chipmaker's deal with Saudi Arabia helped Wall Street become bullish on the company's overseas sales prospects just after Trump banned Nvidia from exporting chips to China, but the Trump administration wants to loosen Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia's exports to other parts of the world, including the Middle East.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it has initiated the process to rescind Biden's AI Proliferation Rule, which was designed to stop the smuggling of U.S. AI chips, particularly those from NVIDIA, into China.

The department also said that ‚Äúthe use of Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.‚Äù Huawei's latest Ascend chip reportedly competes with Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chip.

‚ÄúHuawei chips are not made in the U.S., are not exported from the U.S., and are (at least allegedly) produced without the use of U.S. technology (so it's not clear how customers using them would be in violation of U.S. export restrictions),‚Äù Bernstein's Rasgon said.

‚ÄúHowever, such a reading of the rules would clearly make it more difficult for Huawei to sell its Rise chips to customers outside of China, and would seem to expose Chinese users to more U.S. regulatory repercussions,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis could be a good thing for NVIDIA and other U.S. AI companies, although it remains to be seen how China will respond.‚Äù",2025-05-14,89,33

‚ÄúNvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,‚Äù Seaport wrote.¬†

While the company‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell chips are already sold out for the year, the firm cautioned that ‚Äúbias is to downside risks.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur research indicates significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://www.investing.com/equities/nvidia-corp)) systems,‚Äù they said, citing cooling, configuration, and orchestration hurdles.¬†

They added that there are ‚Äúmounting questions as to \[the\] utility of AI‚Äù as enterprise customers continue to ‚Äúsearch for use cases and ways to generate returns from significant AI investments to date.‚Äù

A growing risk, Seaport warned, comes from Nvidia‚Äôs own customers. ‚ÄúStrong momentum behind hyperscalers‚Äô internal Nvidia alternatives ‚Äì Nvidia‚Äôs largest customers are all looking to design their own chips,‚Äù the analysts noted.

China‚Äôs Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant¬†[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/), The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia‚Äôs H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.

Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month.

Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the U.S. firm‚Äôs products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions.

Seeking to limit China‚Äôs technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia‚Äôs most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.

The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by U.S. authorities before it was even launched.

1k0qunb_NVDA,NVDA,OpenAI Just Showed Nvidia Bear Case Misunderstands the Reality of AI Scaling - $NVDA,"I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that ‚Äúmore efficient models‚Äù like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn‚Äôt hold up to scrutiny ‚Äî especially in light of OpenAI‚Äôs latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI‚Äôs new frontier model (o3). It shows a¬†**direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we‚Äôre seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don‚Äôt shrink the pie ‚Äî¬†**they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek‚Äôs ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù is only relevant because¬†**they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model ‚Äî whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek ‚Äî relies on Nvidia‚Äôs stack to get off the ground.

Here‚Äôs the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute ‚Äî OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don‚Äôt kill GPU demand; they unlock¬†**even more ambitious models**¬†and¬†**more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent‚Ä¶ all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn‚Äôt that Nvidia demand will fall ‚Äî it‚Äôs that demand will¬†**explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don‚Äôt reduce Nvidia‚Äôs relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive¬†**horizontal expansion**¬†of AI compute.",2025-04-16,19,33

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

1jp8s83_NVDA,NVDA,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I‚Äôd try it too.

I‚Äôm from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 ‚Äî that‚Äôs a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I‚Äôm not really interested in learning more about investing ‚Äî I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment ‚Äî I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",2025-04-01,0,95

1jk7f81_NVDA,NVDA,"Moat analysis: what is CUDA, and how does it protect Nvidia?","## Summary

No company is invincible. Not 1990s Microsoft. Not 2000s Google. The purpose is to illuminate Nvidia's moat so investors can learn to spot cracks when they inevitably develop. Whether this occurs in 2025 or 20 years later as with Google is the trillion dollar question.

Nvidia (NVDA) generates revenue with hardware, but digs moats with CUDA. Few investors fully appreciate the powerful moat protecting Nvidia. The CUDA ecosystem, developer tools, and software libraries present high switching costs for customers and formidable network effects locking out competitors. Superior hardware is insufficient to unseat NVDA. AMD and chip competitors must also convince customers to migrate from CUDA, which is daunting because this entails rewriting large portions of code, retraining developers on new tools and new languages, and introducing the risk of subpar performance and production bugs. This sentiment was summed up in a tweet by the company founded by George Hotz, the famed hardware developer who met with senior AMD executives to explore how to help them dethrone Nvidia, ""This is a key thing people miss. They think CUDA is a programming language, or a library, or a runtime, or a driver. But that's not where the value is. The value is in the developer ecosystem, and that's why NVIDIA gets 91% margins.""

## What is CUDA?

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary parallel computing platform that allows developers to harness GPU power for general-purpose processing (GPGPU), supercharging tasks like AI training. It provides APIs, libraries, and tools to optimize code for Nvidia GPUs, transforming them from graphics engines into versatile accelerators. Unlike traditional CPU programming, CUDA enables fine-grained control over thousands of GPU cores, making it indispensable for compute-heavy workloads. Crucially, it abstracts hardware complexity, letting researchers focus on algorithms rather than hardware nuances. This developer-first design has made CUDA the lingua franca of AI infrastructure.

## Why is CUDA a moat for Nvidia?

Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA isn‚Äôt just software‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem that has dominated AI compute for over a decade, locking developers into a virtuous cycle of dependency. By tightly coupling its hardware with CUDA-optimized libraries, Nvidia has made its GPUs the default choice for training cutting-edge AI models, creating immense switching costs. The platform‚Äôs maturity‚Äîbolstered by 15+ years of refinement‚Äîmeans even rivals like AMD (MI300X) or AWS (Inferentia) struggle to replicate its developer tools, documentation, and community support. Enterprises investing in CUDA-based infrastructure face prohibitive retraining and retooling expenses to migrate workflows, further entrenching Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. Meanwhile, CUDA‚Äôs integration with major AI frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow ensures it remains the backbone of the $200B+ AI chip market. Until alternatives achieve parity in usability and performance‚Äîwhile overcoming entrenched ecosystem inertia‚ÄîCUDA will remain Nvidia‚Äôs robust moat.

## What are the alternatives to CUDA?

AMD‚Äôs ROCm and Intel‚Äôs oneAPI aim to replicate CUDA‚Äôs cross-platform flexibility but lack its maturity and developer adoption. AWS‚Äôs Inferentia and Trainium chips, designed for cost-efficient inference and training, bypass CUDA entirely with custom silicon and their Neuron SDK‚Äîthough they‚Äôre mostly confined to AWS‚Äôs cloud ecosystem. AMD‚Äôs CDNA architecture (MI300X) pairs hardware with ROCm software, gaining traction in hyperscalers like Microsoft Azure, but still lags in broad framework support. Startups like Tenstorrent and Cerebras advocate novel architectures but face software ecosystem gaps. Most critically, OpenAI‚Äôs Triton compiler is emerging as a hardware-agnostic alternative, abstracting CUDA dependencies, though it remains early-stage compared to Nvidia‚Äôs entrenched tools.

## Is it that hard to port AI models from NVDA chips?

Porting models isn‚Äôt just about rewriting code‚Äîit‚Äôs rebuilding entire toolchains. CUDA-specific libraries (cuDNN, cuBLAS) are deeply embedded in AI workflows, requiring costly replacements like AMD‚Äôs rocBLAS or AWS‚Äôs Neuron SDK. While frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch add cross-hardware support, optimizing performance for architectures like AMD‚Äôs MI300X or AWS Inferentia demands months of tuning. Startups report 20-30% efficiency drops when migrating to non-Nvidia hardware, eroding ROI despite AWS‚Äôs cost-per-inference claims. However, the rise of standardized compilers (MLIR, Triton) and modular AI stacks is gradually reducing porting friction‚Äîa slow but existential risk to CUDA‚Äôs dominance as AMD, AWS, and others claw into inference workloads.

## What signs would suggest the CUDA moat is eroding?

Major cloud providers like AWS (Inferentia/Trainium) and Google (TPU) are designing in-house AI chips, reducing reliance on Nvidia‚Äôs ecosystem. AMD‚Äôs MI300X, backed by ROCm and partnerships with Microsoft and Oracle, is gaining ground in inference workloads. Frameworks like PyTorch now support non-CUDA backends, lowering migration barriers for alternatives. OpenAI‚Äôs Triton and MLIR compilers are abstracting hardware-specific code, weakening CUDA‚Äôs lock-in. Most tellingly, Nvidia itself now emphasizes ‚ÄúCUDA compatibility‚Äù with rivals‚Äô hardware‚Äîa defensive pivot acknowledging threats from AMD‚Äôs scaling CDNA and AWS‚Äôs vertically integrated solutions.

Don‚Äôt ever get shaken out of your conviction. In trading and life. Tough lesson here but I had to exit this trade due to life circumstances after holding Nvidia for 3 years in sideways action.  I believe these shares would be the equivalent of about $0.43 after splits.

  
I knew the potential of Nvidia in the 90s/early 2000s when I was in high school. I was building gaming computers with their chips after them taking over 3dfx (Voodoo line). My thought was if the GPU is the most important element for gaming and being able to do rapid fire complicated calculations, what is the end game for Nvidia? Well, we know the rest of the story of where that led. So, in 2011 when I started really learning about the stock market, I bought shares and just held it. I had to sell due to a large purchase and at the time, was money better utilized as the frustration of holding no movement in either direction finally got to me.",2025-03-22,386,124

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) ‚Äî is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

News: [London's Heathrow Airport Shut Friday Due To Power Outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/london-s-heathrow-airport-shut-friday-due-to-power-outage)

Overall, mainly earnings today.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d) \- EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.30 expected. Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online. NKE gave a negative earnings outlook, and stated Q4 revenue would decline low-to-mid-teens (10-15%), mainly due to margin pressure from new tariffs. Pretty brutal move. I remember earnings from last year were pretty bad mainly due to weaker demand in China/Online segments. Overall a victim of tariffs, I don't consider this investible for now but things will change if we get any new news regarding tariffs, which are the main headwinds here. IIRC 25% of NKE's shoes are made in China.

[**NIO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&p=d)**-** Revenue of $2.7B in Q4 2024. Vehicle deliveries rose 45.2% YoY (including Onvo vehicles). Net loss widened to RMB 7.11B, a 32.5% YoY increase. Despite the increase in cars sold, they suffered a loss of \~$1B. They've never been profitable since they've started, so reading a little deeper into their reports, there's still concern about liquidity due to current liabilities being higher than current assets this year (a very bad sign when you want to borrow). They cited EV demand in China remains strong, especially in the premium BEV segment. NIO holds a 40% market share in the $40K-$50K car segment (I'm rounding here after conversion).

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**/Quantum Computing stocks**\- Announces that they will be building a quantum lab in Boston. This has moved all the quantum computing stocks to the downside- obviously NVDA has market power in whatever industry they want to enter and compete in and most companies interested in quantum computing will likely prefer their services over the rest of the smaller players. Was the ""quantum computing is a decade away"" comment a brutal play to make the quantum computing sector weaker before his entry? If so, then bravo, that's Game of Thrones worthy scheming.

Operational impact could cause a minor selloff in airlines that have heavy presence there. Nothing too interesting I'm watching, but I think it's worth noting if we see continued slowdowns and ripple effects from this.

In their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been ""5 more years!""

Some facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable ""like an NVIDIA GPU"" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...

Quantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.

The commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)

And now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.

These stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.

Jensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be ""quantum ready for 2025!"" in a blog post.

We have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?

The WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.

This not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.

Finally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)

Who is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.

When the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.

To add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol

This CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.

Enjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.

Short with April hedges.

# Understanding NVIDIA‚Äôs price drop and the AI picture in Wall Street‚Äôs Closed Mind

With massive investments in artificial intelligence, much of Wall Street now sees it as a fad because large corporations are having trouble monetizing AI models.

They think that just because Claude 3.7 Sonnet can‚Äôt and will never replace a $200,000/year software engineer, that AI has no value.

This is illustrated with NVIDIA‚Äôs stock price.

# The AI Revolution is about empowering small businesses

Thanks to AI, a plethora of new-aged companies have emerged with the fastest revenue growth that we have ever seen. Take [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for example.

In less than 12 months, [they reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.](https://sacra.com/c/cursor/) This is a not a business with 1,000 employees; this is a business with 30.

I‚Äôm the same way. Thanks solely due to AI, I could build a fully-feature algorithmic trading and financial research platform in just under 3 years.

Without AI, this would‚Äôve cost me millions. I would‚Äôve had to raise money to hire developers that may not have been able to bring my vision to life.

AI has enabled me, a solo dev, to make my dream come true. And SaaS companies like me and Cursor are not the only beneficiaries.

All small business owners benefit. Even right now, you can cheaply implement AI to:

* Automate customer support
* Find leads that are interested in your business
* Write code faster than ever before possible
* Analyze vast quantities of data that would‚Äôve needed a senior-level data scientist

This isn‚Äôt just speculation. Small business owners are incorporating AI at an alarming rate.

But they are wrong and NVIDIA‚Äôs earnings prove it. The AI race isn‚Äôt slowing down; it‚Äôs just getting started.

1j1mqvm_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA vs GOOGL,"Here's my qualitative analysis

Alphabet (GOOGL) appears to be the better value investment than NVIDIA (NVDA) at current prices.

Both are extraordinary businesses with solid moats, great financials, and bright futures. However, for long-term value-oriented investors, Alphabet offers a more compelling mix of value and quality. It is trading at an appreciable discount to its estimated intrinsic value with a comfortable margin of safety, and its valuation multiples are modest relative to its earnings power and growth prospects. Alphabet‚Äôs wide economic moat in search and advertising is deeply entrenched, and it continues to generate enormous free cash flows, which management is wisely using for reinvestment in AI and returning cash to shareholders. Investors in GOOGL are essentially getting a world-class compounder at a ‚Äúfair‚Äù price or better ‚Äì the kind of setup Buffett often likes (great business, fair price).

NVIDIA, on the other hand, while undeniably a great business, is priced for perfection. Its recent fundamentals are stellar (sky-high ROE/ROIC and growth), but the stock‚Äôs current price leaves little room for error and embeds expectations of prolonged hyper-growth. The lack of a margin of safety means a value investor would have to rely on NVDA‚Äôs future growth to justify today‚Äôs valuation ‚Äì a more speculative proposition in value terms. Put simply, NVDA is an outstanding company selling at a premium, whereas GOOGL is an outstanding company selling at a reasonable (if not discounted) price. Mohnish Pabrai‚Äôs mantra is ‚ÄúHeads, I win; tails, I don‚Äôt lose much.‚Äù Alphabet fits that spirit better: if things go as usual, you win (the company continues to grow and the market re-rates it upwards), and if things go poorly, you have a cushion in the valuation. NVIDIA, by contrast, could deliver huge wins if it continues dominating AI (heads, you win big), but if something goes wrong (tails), the downside could be significant because of the lofty starting point.

Therefore, based on the analysis of intrinsic value, moat, financial strength, profitability, and valuation, Alphabet (GOOGL) is recommended as the superior long-term value investment over NVIDIA (NVDA) at current levels. Alphabet aligns more closely with Buffett and Pabrai‚Äôs principles ‚Äì it‚Äôs a high-quality franchise available at an attractive price with a margin of safety ‚Äì while NVIDIA, despite its quality, is a more aggressive play with a valuation that a conservative value investor might shy away from right now.

Investment Verdict: Buy/Accumulate Alphabet (GOOGL) for value-focused portfolios. NVIDIA (NVDA) is a hold or watchlist candidate ‚Äì a phenomenal company, but wait for a better entry price or a wider margin of safety before committing new capital.

Saw this trade his the tape yesterday - 6800 calls were bought at the 123 strike for 0.08.  It was executed when NVDA was priced at 121.45, meaning these would have to move 1.3% in just over an hour to break even.

1. This is a big move for any name, so it being one of the world's largest companies is really interesting (I couldn't find a better word for degenerate, and don't know how to spell irrespsonsible).
2. This is a really, really short time frame

20 minutes into the trade, with 40 minutes left on the session, volume started to pick up pretty aggressively and NDVA started making moves. Had this position been held to the end, they would have been priced at 1.97.

Few thoughts. Was this blind luck? OR did someone know that a bunch of beat up NVDA shared needed to bought up for whatever funds because of month-end window dressing. Yes, this is tin foil hatty but betting this much this close this far out seems like it's torching money in the toilet.

**Serious** \- some of you really know this stuff well and I am genuinely interested in understanding where my assumption structure falls apart here. I feel like someone acted on some type of privileged info, as opposed to this being a block trade or someone closing a position.

‚úÖ **Winner: NVIDIA (NVDA) based on Value Investing Metrics**

# Analysis & Thoughts üí°

1. **NVIDIA dominates** in growth metrics (**EPS, revenue, and FCF growth**), making it an attractive high-growth stock.
2. **GOOGL wins** in **financial stability** (lower debt, better interest coverage, and cash ratio).
3. **NVDA's high ROE and ROIC** indicate superior capital efficiency, which is key for value investors.
4. **GOOGL's valuation (Earnings Yield, P/E) is more attractive**, meaning it's potentially undervalued.
5. **NVDA's present discount (30%)** is slightly better than GOOGL's (25%), but both are trading at high valuations.

**W**hat do you guys think? I feel like going with NVDA right now but the **PE 44** is still not that great.

Used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls. NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I had a hard time with calculating how many calls I would buy. On one hand I wanted to match the number of calls and puts, but on the other hand, I didn‚Äôt want to buy OTM calls, or spend much more than the premium I received. Love to hear others‚Äô options and their put:call ratios.

I believe Thursday‚Äôs 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums. Worst case scenario, this is basically a limit order for 4,000 shares of NVDA at $110 a share, and I‚Äôm happy to hold onto NVDA at that price.

After one trading day, the premium on the puts have depreciated by around 20%, I will close out the puts at 75% - 85%max returns. At that time, I may also sell the calls and use my profits to increase my NVDA shares.

Does hearing that such a substantial portion of revenue is concentrated in 3 customers worry you? 

I know very little about the industry. I‚Äôve heard, however, that both Amazon and Google are creating their own custom chips. If they scale up their chip-making operations, it could lead to needing to purchase less GPU‚Äôs from Nvidia. 

Also, making up such a large part of sales, doesn‚Äôt this give them increased bargaining power? It would seem that these companies are in a position of leverage to negotiate better pricing from Nvidia, which could reduce margins. 

Lastly, there‚Äôs a question of competition. Again, I don‚Äôt know much, but it seems that Intel and AMD are aggressively improving their AI hardware offerings. If they gain market share, Nvidia‚Äôs largest customers could look to start diversifying their suppliers.

If they post another blowout quarter, it could push tech even higher. But the bigger question is sustainability. How much longer can Nvidia keep up the growth before AI hardware demand slows?

On DeepSeek and AI recursively improving itself is a real concern. If AI can optimize AI models, it could rapidly reduce the cost of training and inference. That means companies like Nvidia might sell fewer high-margin GPUs over time, as AI becomes more efficient and requires less hardware. Right now, Nvidia benefits from the fact that training AI models is extremely expensive and computer-intensive, but if we hit a point where AI starts designing better chips, optimizing training algorithms, or even reducing power consumption drastically, then the return on investment (ROI) for Nvidia‚Äôs customers could shrink.

We‚Äôve already seen this happen in other tech cycles. Cloud computing lowered the need for on-prem servers. Software automation reduced demand for human coders in certain areas. AI optimizing itself could push the industry into a deflationary spiral where each new breakthrough leads to lower costs and less revenue per cycle. Nvidia could try to pivot by offering more AI services (like their AI cloud), but at some point, hardware demand might peak.

Do you think we‚Äôre hitting the peak of AI hardware demand soon, or does Nvidia still have a few years left of growth?

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he ‚Äúexpects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].‚Äù In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect ‚Äú25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.‚Äù

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that ‚ÄúDLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months‚Äù -- it‚Äôs not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro‚Äôs 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo‚Äôs Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell ‚Äúwill be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.‚Äù

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell‚Äôs NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a ‚Äúparticularly strong‚Äù Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv‚Äôs strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell‚Äôs AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the ‚Äúunpredictability of the AI shipments‚Äù as there are ‚Äúsome more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.‚Äù

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: ‚ÄúNow of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory‚Äù and also that it is ‚Äúhigher than what we actually saw in 2024.‚Äù

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were ‚Äúon track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.‚Äù

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn‚Äôt check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products ‚Äúare driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.‚Äù

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 ‚Äì which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. ‚ÄúNow, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that‚Äôs where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.‚Äù

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell‚Äôs rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that ‚ÄúWe know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.‚Äù

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: ‚ÄúJust to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.‚Äù

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that ‚Äúnet sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company‚Äôs previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.‚Äù

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations ‚Äì it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly ‚Äúdisrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,‚Äù by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell‚Äôs ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it‚Äôs the suddenness that Semtech pulled it‚Äôs guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors ‚Äì the timing of Blackwell‚Äôs launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia‚Äôs stock marches higher ‚Äì perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",2025-02-23,126,52

1im1g50_META,META,Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report,"TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025 revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue of $49.265 billion which is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations of $38.13 billion.

This is the author‚Äôs opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.

NVIDIA will report its¬†Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is¬†$38.13 billion. In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings.¬†One of the biggest headlines¬†was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:

Year	|Meta	|Alphabet	|Microsoft	|Amazon	| Sum 2024 ($bn)	|39.2	|52.6	|75.6	|77.8	|245.2 2025 (planned, $bn)	|65.0	|75.0	|80.0	|100.0	|320.0

Much less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:

Category	|Meta	|Alphabet	|Microsoft	|Amazon	| Sum Last quarter reported ($bn)	|14.425	|14.276	|15.804	|27.834	|72.339 Previous quarter ($bn)	|8.258	|13.061	|14.923	|22.620	|58.862 Change from previous quarter	|+74.7%	|+9.3%	|+5.9%	|+23.1%	|+22.90%

Since these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.

Of course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but¬†they are much less cost-effective¬†than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as¬†Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week: ""most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future."" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.

In addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer¬†Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering¬†$500 billion in new AI infrastructure¬†over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.",2025-02-10,0,5

1iis4qs_NVDA,NVDA,"Need advice on how to be more pragmatic with my stock buy/sell for year 2025. NVDA, MSTR, GOOGL recent picks were not fruitful at all.","The issue is, I am super mad at my recent stock picks. I either made a loss or net gain is zero. 

What I need to understand is what is the strategy that is popular to pick stocks or either before breakout?

What I recently realized is I am doing all wrong with 'stock picking' Website like, Yahoo Finance show 'live' data and it is stupid to buy stock based on their current trading value. The decision to buy/sell a stock based on current number makes no sense. 

My reason why I am typing this up is due to the following reasons:

1.  Bought NVDA at 120, 134 and 141 and sold at 145, only a portion of my total holding. Only few days ago, I saw it at 114 and decided to liquidate all my holding at the price.    With anticipation the stock will further crash. I was so wrong. In the end, I made no money off my trade (I probably lost since I will owe capital gain tax)

2. On my HSA, I bought MSTR for $340 or $450. I sold those at a loss and lost $1500

3. Bought GOOGL before the earning at $205. And we all know how that panned out, 8% negative. Today, I was so close to selling it and take in the loss, but I said 'no'. I need to understand what the F I am doing wrong.

  
Now, when I zoom back into my portfolio, the money maker for me has been either buying an ETF and kinda set and forget (not all ETF, FXAIX has been great) or bought tech stocks before they sky rocket. For example, Meta stock. I do have NVDA holding but they are from long time ago.

  
In conclusion, with all this and me sharing my recent trade, my question is, what is the programmatic way to pick and buy a stock. Because frankly, keeping up to date with recent price on Yahoo Finance, I think it is pretty useless. IMO, I see the current price to reflect what has already happened. It does not indicate WHAT will happen or where the stocks are heading.

In terms of 'RSI', MACD line, etc. I did explore it to kinda predict NVDA stock, but it was all a bust. I don't know if it is worth pursing it big time.

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".**¬†I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:**¬†Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:**¬†Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:**¬†NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on¬†[stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/)¬†consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable.¬†**Potential**¬†investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple¬†[sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to¬†**train**¬†better models that¬†**end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:**¬†Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply.¬†See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:**¬†It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions.¬†[Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox)¬†is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:**¬†CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now.¬†[However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips.¬†](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an¬†honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:**¬†Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency**¬†and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last**¬†in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:**¬†Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments**¬†(StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D**¬†as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

I've included a screenshot of interviews by Rihard Jarc with a former AMD employee on CUDA and training needs going forward after DeepSeek.",2025-02-05,66,32

Hello fellow investors,

I‚Äôm currently evaluating a $10,000 investment over the next year and am deliberating between NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Given the dynamic nature of the tech industry, I would appreciate your insights on the potential trajectories of these two companies.

NVIDIA (NVDA):

NVIDIA has solidified its position as a leader in AI hardware and chip technology. The company‚Äôs GPUs are integral to various applications, from gaming to data centers and autonomous vehicles. Recently, NVIDIA‚Äôs market capitalization surpassed Microsoft‚Äôs, making it the world‚Äôs second-largest company by market cap.  Ôøº

However, the emergence of competitors like China‚Äôs DeepSeek, which has developed a cost-effective AI model, poses potential challenges. DeepSeek‚Äôs advancements have raised questions about the sustainability of high capital expenditures by US tech companies on AI.  Ôøº

Additionally, recent geopolitical developments, such as the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, have led to market volatility. NVIDIA‚Äôs stock experienced a decline, which some attribute to these tariffs and the competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek.  Ôøº

Microsoft (MSFT):

Microsoft continues to be a dominant force in software and cloud computing. The company‚Äôs strategic integration of AI across its product suite and its partnership with OpenAI underscore its commitment to innovation. In Q1 2025, Microsoft reported a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue, with the Microsoft Cloud division seeing a 22% surge.  Ôøº

However, analysts have raised concerns about Microsoft‚Äôs reliance on NVIDIA for its AI and cloud computing efforts. As competitors develop custom AI processors, Microsoft‚Äôs dependence on third-party hardware could impact its competitive position.  Ôøº

Considerations:
	‚Ä¢	Growth Potential vs. Stability: NVIDIA offers significant growth potential, especially with the increasing demand for AI applications. However, this comes with higher volatility due to market competition and geopolitical factors. Microsoft provides a more diversified portfolio, potentially offering more stability but with comparatively moderate growth prospects.
	‚Ä¢	Valuation: NVIDIA‚Äôs rapid ascent has led to high valuations, which may be susceptible to market corrections. Microsoft‚Äôs valuation, while also elevated, is supported by its diverse revenue streams.
	‚Ä¢	Risk Factors: NVIDIA faces risks from emerging competitors and geopolitical tensions affecting its supply chain. Microsoft‚Äôs risks include its dependency on external hardware providers and the need to continually innovate in the competitive cloud space.

Given these factors, I‚Äôm interested in the community‚Äôs perspective. Which company do you believe offers a better investment opportunity over the next year, considering the current market dynamics and potential risks? Your insights and any additional considerations would be greatly appreciated.",2025-02-03,3,27

The beginning of every month since October NVDA has rallied. NVDA is in a key area here as well as this is the first test of a major demand zone. NVDA already bounced and took out the .28 retrace to end the month. If NVDA moves the way it has been since October and respects this level I‚Äôm predicting a rally back up to 136.50 (at the very least) next week. ",2025-02-02,0,45
1ifhgsu_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA LEAP call,"Just selling options at this point but want to better understand the buying side.  Scenario:  Say I want to buy NVDA during this pull back at $119.  Instead of buying 100 shares for $11,900 I purchase a long call with a ridiculously low strike price of $25 for Dec 19 2025.  I pay the $9,668 premuim for the right to buy 100 shares on or before Dec 19.  Total all in would be $2,500 + $9,668 (12,190) Break even is around $121.  Everything I have read frowns on this but to me it seems viable.  If NVDA hits $180 at years end it would be about $6,000 profit in less than a year which is a bit over 50%.  Of course it could end up below $121 and that is why I have been hesitant about buying options.  Can I make more than $6000 in a year with $12,000 capital running the wheel?  Pretty close and much safer. I understand buying at a strike price closer to current price would reduce premuim/risk but would limit profit.  Just trying to justify buying calls.",2025-02-01,17,40

There is not the moat people kept saying.  Maybe 5 years ago but not now.  We might see a 1 trillion drop in market cap in 1 day, there‚Äôs so much coming down the road at much better energy efficiency, price, etc.

People think it‚Äôs DeepSeek but there‚Äôs more that don‚Äôt need CUDA the holy moat and right next to DeepSeek running on something that isn‚Äôt NVDA at a much better efficiency and cost.

1iblv26_META,META,Nvidia‚Äôs $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ‚Äî Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world‚Äôs largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company‚Äôs market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record ‚Äî a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value ‚Äî and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday‚Äôs slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek‚Äôs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.‚Äôs App Store rankings. 

‚ÄúConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,‚Äù Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren‚Äôt showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China‚Äôs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek‚Äôs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek‚Äôs model is an ‚Äúexcellent AI advancement‚Äù and indicated that the Chinese company didn‚Äôt violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires ‚Äúrequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.‚Äù

1ibcf82_NVDA,NVDA,Help a newbie investor? Should I buy the NVIDIA dip or not in the wake of this Deepseek news?,"My Nvidia monetary value literally went from $45k to $32k or somewhere in there today. Not to mention all the other Nasdaq stocks it is dragging down with it. Ugggg. 

How might the fact that Deepseek is open source affect the comeback price of Nvidia?

And was Nvidia way overvalued anyway? 

Edit: 
1. Before anyone else wants to keep on spanking me hard for panicking over the value drop in the stock I am most heavily invested in (one that literally set a new record for loss of value in a company in a single day) ‚Äî and 

2. For those who have been scolding me about diversification‚Äîjust know that I AM highly diversified in every other security or ETF or index fund, etc.  that I hold. There is a long and nutty story about how I got stuck with such a large stake in NVIDIA relative to the rest of my brokerage account and a reason why I couldn‚Äôt just take profits and sell it.  It‚Äôs just too long and too weird and too personal to tell, and also highly irrelevant. 

So thank you for everyone who is being nice to me even though I have apparently asked a very stupid question, and also apparently in the wrong place. (Sorry.) 

‚Äî

Next Day update‚Äîafter listening to many of you guys and reading the WSJ and some other overnight news about what PROBABLY REALLY happened in China‚ÄîI decided to buy the dip right after it bottomed out at the open. Glad I did. But I didn‚Äôt ONLY buy NVDA, and I made a pile of money.  I thank those of you who helped me. 

So I guess that settles that. Thank you again to everyone who was nice or educational and helpful.

The chipmaker‚Äôs stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia‚Äôs worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia‚Äôs drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek‚Äôs latest technology has caused ‚Äúgreat angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.‚Äù

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they ‚Äúthink this view is farthest from the truth,‚Äù and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to ‚Äúthe AI industry wanting more compute, not less.‚Äù

But after Nvidia‚Äôs huge run-up ‚Äî the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year ‚Äî the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta‚Äôs $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia‚Äôs decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang‚Äôs net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes‚Äô real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple‚Äôs App Store. The model‚Äôs development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House‚Äôs AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek‚Äôs model ‚Äúshows that the AI race will be very competitive‚Äù and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden‚Äôs executive order last week on AI safety.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident in the U.S. but we can‚Äôt be complacent,‚Äù Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

For me, this is significant as I don't come from wealth.

I'm 35 and have a growing family. This also happens to be a good year for me to make some gains with stocks because I'm taking a lot of time off from work this year for family bonding and will likely fall into a lower tax bracket. I still have to speak with my CPA about this.

After selling some of these shares, I plan to purchase more index funds that track with the S&P 500. I feel more comfortable with this move, even if it means losing out on further NVDA gains in 10-20+ years. I have a feeling there will be some pullback on the stock and AI in the shortterm.

1hvywop_META,META,Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,"# Summary

* Nvidia‚Äôs 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia‚Äôs lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company‚Äôs dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google‚Äôs CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won‚Äôt match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta‚Äôs CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD‚Äôs MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom‚Äôs custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract electronics maker, beat expectations to post its highest-ever revenue for the fourth quarter on continued strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers.


Revenue for Apple's biggest iPhone assembler jumped 15.2% to T$2.13 trillion ($64.72 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.


It was also ahead of a T$2.1 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurat

Robust AI server demand led to strong revenue growth for its cloud and networking products division, said Foxconn, whose customers include AI chip firm Nvidia.


For smart consumer electronics, which includes iPhones, there was ""roughly flattish"" year-on-year growth, it said.


Total revenue in December alone reached T$654.8 billion, up 42.3% year on year and the second-highest ever level for the month.

In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,"" Foxconn said of its outlook for the current quarter.


""Even with record high revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, the sequential performance of the first quarter will reach roughly similar levels that are average to the past five years; compared with a year ago, it should show significant growth.""",2025-01-06,130,7

In the world of predictions, especially when it comes to financial markets, having conviction often means standing alone. When I stated confidently that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock (NVDA) would rise above $142, the response was less than encouraging. The majority not only doubted me but chose to express their disbelief in ways that were far from constructive.

It is human nature to resist what we cannot immediately understand. A new perspective can seem threatening, particularly when it challenges the consensus. But I‚Äôve always believed that the market rewards those who do their own analysis and trust the indicators that have proven their value over time.

Today, with NVDA trading above $143.50, my prediction has been validated. This isn‚Äôt just a win for me but a reminder of the importance of discipline, patience, and belief in one‚Äôs work. The journey wasn‚Äôt about proving others wrong‚Äîit was about staying true to what I saw and believed, regardless of the noise.

To those who doubted: skepticism is healthy, but arrogance in dismissing new ideas rarely serves anyone well. Perhaps next time, a touch of humility and openness to alternate viewpoints might lead to better outcomes. After all, the market doesn‚Äôt reward insults; it rewards insight.

To everyone navigating this complex world of stocks: may your analyses be sharp, your convictions steadfast, and your attitudes open to learning from all‚Äîeven those you initially disagree with.  For the record, as of this writing NVDA is trading way above $143...

# Nvidia Locks In $700M AI Play

Nvidia has closed its $700 million acquisition of Israeli AI startup Run:ai, a move designed to optimize AI infrastructure and extend its dominance in the booming artificial intelligence sector. Regulatory hurdles? Cleared for takeoff‚Äîat least in Europe.

**Opening the Playbook**

Run:ai‚Äôs software, which helps maximize the efficiency of Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, will now be open-sourced. Translation: competitors like AMD and Intel can use the software too. Why share the crown jewels? Nvidia‚Äôs move could be a play to quiet antitrust critics while expanding its influence across the broader AI ecosystem.

The startup, which Nvidia has worked with since 2020, adds a critical layer to Nvidia‚Äôs growing empire‚Äîhelping power everything from data centers to cutting-edge AI systems.

**Antitrust Drama**

The deal wasn‚Äôt a breeze. Regulators in the EU gave the green light after a deep dive but didn‚Äôt miss the fact that Nvidia already controls about 80% of the GPU market. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice continues to take a closer look, adding a hint of uncertainty to Nvidia‚Äôs unchecked expansion.

For Nvidia, the stakes are high. As AI reshapes industries, its latest acquisition shows it‚Äôs not just chasing innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs determined to own the infrastructure behind it.

# Jeju Air Tragedy Sends Shockwaves Through Aviation

Boeing shares dropped 2% Monday after a tragic Jeju Air crash in South Korea killed 179 people, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in the nation‚Äôs history. Investigators are now looking into potential causes, including a bird strike and landing gear failure, as South Korea orders emergency inspections of all 737-800 planes in the country.

**The Timeline**

Here‚Äôs how the tragic event unfolded: Flight 2216, carrying 181 passengers and crew from Bangkok to Muan International Airport, declared a mayday after receiving a bird strike warning. The pilot aborted the first landing attempt, but during the second attempt, the landing gear failed to deploy. The jet skidded off the runway, struck a wall, and exploded into flames. Only two crew members survived.

Officials retrieved black boxes for analysis, while the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are lending support to the investigation. The 737-800 has been a reliable aviation staple, but this incident has raised serious questions.

**Why It Matters**

This isn‚Äôt just an isolated event‚Äîit‚Äôs a major moment for Boeing, which is still reeling from past controversies surrounding its 737 Max series. South Korea has 101 active 737-800s across carriers like Jeju Air, Korean Air, and T‚Äôway Air, and the crash has spurred a nationwide inspection to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

Adding to the scrutiny: Jeju Air‚Äôs stock hit an all-time low following the crash, and Boeing is under pressure to uphold the reputation of its long-standing workhorse model. Aviation analysts believe investigators will closely examine bird strike standards, emergency response protocols, and why the landing gear wasn‚Äôt deployed.

**Bigger Picture:**¬†The tragedy also lands during political upheaval in South Korea, where Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a week of mourning. For Boeing and South Korean aviation, this is more than a PR crisis‚Äîit‚Äôs a test of safety practices in one of the industry‚Äôs most trusted aircraft models.",2024-12-30,1,0

1hfldj9_NVDA,NVDA,From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let‚Äôs start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom‚Äôs impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention‚Äîsimilar to Microsoft‚Äôs current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It‚Äôs akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We‚Äôre likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here‚Äôs the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60‚Äì90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom‚Äôs ASIC solutions and NVIDIA‚Äôs GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC‚Äîbeing application-specific‚Äîcould offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn‚Äôt match Broadcom momentum.

No need to fear heights‚ÄîBroadcom rally has just begun.",2024-12-16,21,41

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let‚Äôs take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA‚Äôs share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let‚Äôs find out! 

For our example, we‚Äôll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let‚Äôs say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA‚Äôs trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn‚Äôt just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we‚Äôve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let‚Äôs take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market‚Äôs pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA‚Äôs price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA‚Äôs earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA‚Äôs future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company‚Äôs evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you‚Äôre only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I‚Äôd much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don‚Äôt give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They‚Äôve decided they‚Äôll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA‚Äôs finances and how it relates to its price, let‚Äôs take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA‚Äôs Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you‚Äôve never heard of Moore‚Äôs Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore‚Äôs Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA‚Äôs CEO and his company‚Äôs own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore‚Äôs Law? We don‚Äôt even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA‚Äôs hardware products. Well, there‚Äôs one thing we do know, it‚Äôs how to bullshit. So let‚Äôs wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law‚Äôs dead,‚Äù Huang said, ‚ÄúAnd the ability for Moore‚Äôs Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It‚Äôs completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.‚Äù

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore‚Äôs Law is dead. The CEO said it‚Äôs over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA‚Äôs long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO‚Äôs statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore‚Äôs law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. ü§£

And to finish things off, we‚Äôll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI‚Äôs biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it‚Äôs really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the ‚Äúmanagement would never steal from shareholders‚Äù fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We‚Äôve learned a lot. We‚Äôve seen the impressive growth of NVDA‚Äôs earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We‚Äôve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We‚Äôve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

# China Opens Probe Into Nvidia, Adding Heat to Global Tech War

Nvidia just found itself in Beijing‚Äôs crosshairs.

Chinese regulators launched an antitrust probe into the U.S. chip giant over its $7 billion Mellanox acquisition from 2020. The investigation centers on whether Nvidia violated conditions set at the time of the deal, like ensuring fair treatment of Chinese firms. Shares of the chipmaker dipped 2.55% on the news, a minor dent considering the company‚Äôs meteoric 188% rise this year.

**Escalation in a Global AI Arms Race**

This isn‚Äôt just about chips; it‚Äôs the latest salvo in the U.S.-China tech cold war. The Biden administration‚Äôs export bans on advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia, aim to curb China‚Äôs military and tech ambitions.¬†

Meanwhile, China‚Äôs response includes restricting exports of key raw materials and now flexing its regulatory muscle on Nvidia. Adding to the tension, President-elect Trump has promised steep tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the rift.

**Nvidia‚Äôs Global Scrutiny**

China isn‚Äôt the only one with questions about Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. U.S. and European regulators have also probed the chipmaker for antitrust violations in the past year, focusing on whether it‚Äôs leveraging its market power to unfairly edge out competition.¬†

While these cases often take years to resolve, they underline the risks of being the top player in the AI chip market‚Äîa sector critical for everything from large language models to military tech.

**The Bigger Picture**

Despite the regulatory clouds, Nvidia remains an investor favorite, riding high on AI‚Äôs explosive growth. But the ongoing scrutiny shows how geopolitical tensions and regulatory backlash can weigh even on the most successful players. For Nvidia, this could be a long game of managing compliance while staying ahead of rivals in the AI arms race.

The takeaway? Nvidia‚Äôs dominance might still be intact, but the scrutiny underscores how its position at the heart of the U.S.-China tech battle is both an asset and a liability.

# Mondelez Takes Another Bite at Hershey

Oreo and Ritz powerhouse Mondelez International has rekindled its interest in acquiring Hershey, the maker of Reese‚Äôs and Kisses, in a deal that could create a global snacks behemoth with $50 billion in combined sales.¬†

Hershey shares surged over 10% following the news, marking their best day since Mondelez‚Äôs first takeover attempt in 2016. Back then, Hershey rejected a $23 billion bid, and Mondelez walked away.

**Sweet Opportunity or Sticky Situation?**

Mondelez‚Äôs approach comes amid challenges for Hershey, including record-high cocoa prices and competition from health-conscious trends like GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. While Hershey‚Äôs iconic chocolate brands remain household names, the company recently lowered its sales outlook, citing inflation-weary consumers.¬†

The Hershey Trust, which holds 80% of the company‚Äôs voting stock, remains a key player in any potential deal. Its approval is essential, and history suggests they‚Äôre not easily swayed.

**The Stakes Are High**

This deal wouldn‚Äôt just be about chocolate. It‚Äôs a response to broader pressures in the packaged food sector, where companies are seeking mergers to combat slowing growth and rising costs. Mondelez, whose portfolio includes Toblerone and Cadbury, is no stranger to M&A and sees Hershey as a gateway to bolstering its North American dominance while expanding into new global markets.

But there‚Äôs a bitter side. Pennsylvania law could allow the state attorney general to step in if the Hershey Trust loses significant power, a hurdle that has derailed past attempts to acquire the chocolate maker. And let‚Äôs not forget the Federal Trade Commission, which might scrutinize such a large deal in today‚Äôs antitrust-focused climate.

**Takeaway:**¬†A Mondelez-Hershey merger could redefine the global snack landscape, but it‚Äôs far from a done deal. With regulatory hurdles and Hershey‚Äôs storied independence at play, the outcome might hinge on whether Mondelez can sweeten its offer enough to satisfy both the Hershey Trust and cautious regulators.

1h28t5b_GOOGL,GOOGL,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

1gvzznw_NVDA,NVDA,I‚Äôve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I‚Äôm Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I‚Äôve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I‚Äôve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia‚Äôs AI efforts, from reporting on how they‚Äôre dealing with¬†[the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html)¬†to¬†[attending the company‚Äôs GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html)¬†to chatting with¬†[CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia‚Äôs chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like¬†[AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia‚Äôs own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone‚Äôs guess.

In today‚Äôs fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

üíµ Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
üí≤ Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
üíæ Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I‚Äôll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia‚Äôs latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

1ghyq7o_META,META,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

Played NVDA yesterday and caught the whole rally from open to close using dark pools transactions. You had a massive transaction come in on the dark pool tape at close on Friday at $138. You also had a transaction from Thursday at 139.16 that had not touched yet aside from when the initial order came in. 

  
The following Monday I looked at the stock and noticed that it had been moving premarket around $138 and placed an order premarket for the NVDA 149C 10/25 Expiration at 0.20. The order didn't fill at open, so I moved the order to .22 where I filled and took the option all the way up to as high as 0.90.

  
This is a screenshot of my position while I was in it yesterday.

1g3pofm_META,META,Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker‚Äôs top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia‚Äôs revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is ‚Äúinsane‚Äù and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

1fwv9cq_META,META,American Funds generally exclude Nvidia. So disappointing.,"I inherited a sizable Roth IRA, and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that Nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds.

The 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap, it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this. The expense ratios are extremely high, and the holdings make no sense either:

[American Balanced Fund¬Æ (ABALX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/ABALX) mostly Microsoft, Broadcom, and Google

[Capital Income Builder¬Æ (CAIBX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/CAIBX) mostly Broadcom, Phillip Morris, and Abby Vie

[The Growth Fund of America¬Æ (AGTHX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AGTHX) mostly Microsoft, Meta, and Google (AHA...Nvidia is actually in there, but only at 3.5% of the fund)

[The Investment Company of America¬Æ (AIVSX)](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/AIVSX) Microsoft, Broadcom, Microsoft, Google, Meta.

The amount of money that was ""lost"" by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd. Why don't their funds just track the S&P 500?

I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%.

I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion.

The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.

Backtested a momentum strat for NVDA over the last 30 market sessions. 100% mechanical. No nuance. It was either take 100% profit or 100% loss. No ema, no vwap, no magic. Just used 2 day prior range and %'s.  

  
The R/R was: 1.67 , win was 25% of 2 day prior range, loss was 15% of prior 2 day range. 

  
The strategy: Take hi/low range for last two market sessions combined (I used daily hi/lo indicator on ToS.) Using total prior 2 day range, the play started when price hit the 25% mark in either direction. It is a momentum play, so when price went down 25% of prior 2 day range, it triggered a short  and vice versa. If price momentum stalled and reversed, the stop was at the 10% mark. Take profit was price continuing on to hit the 50% mark. So a loss was 15% of prior 2 day range and a win was 25% of prior 2 day range. 

  
Totals: 

11 LOSSES for a Total of 1547 cents (Average loser was 140 cents)

1fahrhc_META,META,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

For some context I‚Äôm quite new to options and have been experimenting with some covered calls on a paper account. 

I‚Äôve been aiming for around a 10-15% profit yearly from premiums alone which has been going well, however I had a look at NVIDIA in the early hours of this morning to see some great premiums on calls I deemed to be relatively safe. 

I bought 400 shares at 119 (again paper account), selling calls for 131, 137, 141, and 144, gaining me ¬£445, ¬£345, ¬£167, and ¬£174 respectively, all expiring the next day (30th August). 

I wanted to see which of these would execute and which I would keep, just to experiment, however after looking again today at premiums for NVDA for a 1 or 8DTE, they‚Äôre massively smaller, at around 1/9th of the gain I would have netted early this morning. 

I‚Äôm well aware that the premiums I got are huge, and I assumed this was due to NVDAs high volatility, however I‚Äôm struggling to understand how the potential premiums can fluctuate so massively, and how I would be able to find similarly massive premium opportunities in the future. 

Excuse me if my terminology isn‚Äôt all quite right, as I‚Äôve only started a few weeks ago, so any help would be amazing!

1f3wqir_NVDA,NVDA,A quick opinion on what happened yesterday with NVDA,,2024-08-29,0,19
1f3p767_META,META,Short term Nvidia call holders- it's over. ,"Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.

No, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. 

Again, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. 

What I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. 

Positions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. 

TL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further.

1f3wp6i_NVDA,NVDA,A quick opinion on what happened yesterday with NVDA,"    2Q EPS $0.68, EST. $0.64
    2Q REVENUE $30.00B, EST. $28.72B

NVDA successfully beat all previous consensus estimates for the last quarters. The last two earnings reports led to the price increase, but not this time.

**Why?**

1. It was in the price already and the market expected ""something extraordinary"".
2. Just having ""good results"" is not enough anymore.

And those are bad.

But the most ""interesting"" is that NVDA announced a $50B buyback. Why? Because the organic growth has slowed down they just want to artificially keep the price to be rising.

**When do companies make buybacks?**

1. Undervaluation: Companies frequently buy back shares when they perceive their stock to be undervalued, signalling confidence in future performance.
2. Free Cash Flow: Firms with excess free cash flow are more likely to engage in buybacks, especially when market timing is poor. This suggests that the desire to distribute cash to shareholders can outweigh market conditions.
3. Economic Environment: During economic downturns, companies may use buybacks to stabilize stock prices and enhance per-share earnings, particularly when other financial metrics are declining.

**The last one is more realistic, since:**

1. High interest rates.
2. Inverted¬†[yield curve indicator](https://longtermpick.com/p/10-2-bond-spread).
3. Poor recent¬†[economic data](https://longtermpick.com/p/on-the-verge-of-a-recession).

1f3judv_NVDA,NVDA,Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and guidance, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading.

Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted versus 64 cents per share expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $30.04 billion versus $28.7 billion expected by LSEG.

Nvidia said it expected about $32.5 billion in current quarter revenue, versus $31.77 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Nvidia is the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Its market value has expanded more than nine times since the end of 2022 and was up 34% since the company‚Äôs last earnings report.  

Nvidia said it approved $50 billion in share buybacks.

1f2xbn6_NVDA,NVDA,Things to consider before betting it all on NVDA earnings tomorrow.,"**TLDR; I AM AS REGARDED as the next guy, but I recommend lowering exposure to NVDA earnings tomorrow to save money to play the aftermath.**

Tomorrow is the Super Bowl of stocks. It's no secret that everyone down to the shoe shiner is balls deep in NVDA (mostly long, looking at the options chain) exposure. There are also those hoping for the end of the world to begin tomorrow. But the one thing we know about Wall Street as a certainty is that they don't like when retail wins.

**We are all aware of the bull case. VERY simplified:**

1. Major tech companies have significantly increased CAPEX in Q2 and it doesn't take a genius to figure out where that money went.

2. Tech CEOs have been quoted as saying that underspending is more of an issue than overspending. *See* *also* Sam Altman (OpenAI) & Co. as being open supporters of the theory of effective accelerationism, which in a nutshell is the belief that the pursuit of general intelligence warrants all costs, natural and financial.

3. Nvidia is still founder led at this scale by Jensen Huang who is an amazing man and one of the greatest minds of our time. 

**The bear case is mostly about forward guidance, as pretty much everyone believes there will be an EPS beat. This is mostly macroeconomic and includes:**

1. Concerns about tech companies not being able to profit from AI spending, leading to winding down.

Rebuttal: We're not going to see this materialize this quarter. Tech has barely dipped their toes into seeing what value they can extract out of the newest line of hardware. It is simply too early to see. Even if you don't buy that, see previous point about under/overspending.

2. Blackwell delays 

Rebuttal: Priced in, much like the heat death of the universe itself. But really, who cares about this. Blackwell is still the only game in town.

3. US economy slowing, 800k jobs just ""lost"" while stocks are nearing ATH, election concerns, general stuff like that.

Rebuttal: No rebuttal. Completely legitimate to believe that a large correction is looming, if you're not kidding yourself. 

**So why not move all in tomorrow? 50/50 is better odds than what retail usually get anyways.**

You all know about IV crush, how NVDA is already priced to jump basically 10% after earnings, and all that. If you need to play options, please consider getting ones longer than August 30, which will be impacted the most. September 20 seems like a fair middle ground between ""fun"" leverage and having enough time to correct the ship should things go bad. 

You also all know that the world is watching these earnings the way we watch a groundhog come out of a hole to tell us if there are going to be six more weeks of winter or early spring. If you are patient enough to hold cash and simply wait to see the outcome, you WILL make money on placing a directionally good bet - with the benefit of being able to scoop up IV crushed options. It is also possible to hold SPY calls/puts as a proxy for NVDA to lessen the impact of IV crush.

It is a likely reality that big money is able to keep the prices pinned this week so that these 130's expire cheap or worthless. A massive 128.60 institutional buy wall was briefly up today, before the stint over 129, which suggests to me that smart money/funds are keeping dry powder ready. 

Please consider which would minimize regret: missing out on winning the big 50/50 or not having the funds to act on what will be very well informed plays for the direction of the entire market over the next 1-2 months.

Thank you very much, may God protect our savings.",2024-08-28,976,366

1f2in8c_NVDA,NVDA,Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters,"* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.
* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. 
* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. 
* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.
* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**

Tldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra. We will have bigger problems than Nvidia stock if that happens.",2024-08-27,496,365
1f1t8bn_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA call risk of holding through earnings?,"Picked up these two 11/15/24 110c on that nice dip a few weeks ago (the only time I wanted to pay the longer call prices). My general strategy is to buy mid-long and sell about half the position to cover the rest if it gains 50-100%, or exit before 30-45 DTE especially if theta goes much above ~0.15. This has treated me well with about 100% overall account gain in 6 months. I know it‚Äôs a lot of luck too. 
I think the conservative thing would be to sell one of these two calls now before earnings on Weds to cover the remaining one and capture a 20% gain. Then, I‚Äôd let that remaining one ride to capture any further upside.
However, given they have a Nov expiry (and it‚Äôs NVDA, and still well below the ATH) it may be good to keep both since the expiry is almost to next earnings and it could run up quite a bit the next couple months. How would you make this decision, and with what factors?

1f14gxu_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA | How to make money in options,"4 times a year the biggest announcement comes upon us and yes here it is again this week!

Needless to say the price action the next few weeks is going to ruin some of you and make others of you want to call nana.

How can you make money on options this week? Well, I‚Äôve written you a helpful guide to do so.

Prior to Wednesday market close:
- puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower
- $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls).
- swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings.

Wednesday market close:
- stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it‚Äôll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain.

Thursday Morning:
- let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday.
- I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend.
- calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that‚Äôs LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don‚Äôt know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies.

TL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out.

1et5yvq_GOOGL,GOOGL,Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‚ÄòYou know what to do in the stock market‚Äô,"I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion ‚Äî very very hard,‚Äù said Schmidt, adding that he‚Äôs a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* ‚ÄúIf $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,‚Äù Schmidt said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a stock recommendation.‚Äù Schmidt didn‚Äôt say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google‚Äôs lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won‚Äôt be the only winner in AI, but there aren‚Äôt a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can‚Äôt spend as freely.

* ‚ÄúAt the moment, the gap between the frontier models ‚Äî there are only three ‚Äî and everyone else appears to be getting larger,‚Äù Schmidt said. ‚ÄúSix months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I‚Äôm not so sure.‚Äù

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company‚Äôs CUDA programming language. He said AMD‚Äôs software that translates Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA code for its own chips ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work yet.‚Äù

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.",2024-08-15,467,173

1equ4bv_NVDA,NVDA,My NVDA Pre-Earninng's Play Opened Today.,"It's a wide double calendar, with a diagonal added to cover the dead zone in the middle. These are the strikes selected for the double calendar.

&#x200B;

[$91\/$130 double calendar](https://preview.redd.it/ovjfs98msbid1.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b03dd240908121f07f7c99bf054ef175d81c53)

It creates a dead zone in the middle, but my strikes are so wide placed at previous support/resistance the strikes should not be breached. Ideally, price close to $91 or $130 right before earning's would be best case scenario to close 8/28 before earning's release before IV crush. This double calendar is about $150-$160 to open. Market close priced spiked so the $268 loss isn't accurate it's less cost.

&#x200B;

[Dead Zone](https://preview.redd.it/6zwwhurnsbid1.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca3c14d9d48181665a768acc513bc0aef6bd5a5)

I tried covering the dead zone with a butterfly, calendar and diagonal. The butterfly wasn't wide enough although cheap. The calendar if IV rose and price stayed flat, I'd lose to Theta on long legs and Vega ramping up in short legs due to IV expansion I'd lose to as well. So PnL can't be trusted, probably a loss with calendar trying to close before earning's. The diagonal if ITM wouldn't be so exact in intrinsic value so wouldn't be as difficult to close for a small profit out of the 3.

&#x200B;

[Diagonal covering dead zone](https://preview.redd.it/w1a9xg7qsbid1.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=87833d30e74666fcd58f1dcec253f5f9cbe7c492)

This is the diagonal covering dead zone. If price runs to $125 before earning's, the double cals will be nicely in-profit and the diagonal will have gained so much intrinsic value, but the strike difference would still give me $100. Unlike using a calendar, IV expansion before earning's and so exact in intrinsic value due to same strikes would be impossible to close for profit. It's a small insurance to cover dead zone if price is flat, which is more effective than using a butterfly or single calendar while presenting more advantage if runs deep ITM.

**CONCLUSION**: Was asked to show visuals of my trades/idea in-mind. I've taken this trade as of today. As long as price does not breach $91/$130, and even if it does to some degree will be able to close double calendars for nice profit. The expir. of long legs is 9/13 instead of 9/6 which makes the long legs more resilient to IV expansion and price running, as they now have slightly higher delta and Vega, and lower Theta assisting the Theta positive position. It's paying a little more to build a better, more resilient double calendar. *3 double cals to 1 diagonal was my ratio.*

**EDIT 1**: This is a triple calendar basically. Playing pre-earning's to close before release. ",2024-08-13,24,94

1ep990m_NVDA,NVDA,Hedging for NVDA earnings,"Hi All,

I need advice on how to hedge my NVDA position for the upcoming earnings at end of August.
I currently own 1,100 shares at an average cost basis of 30 dollars per share.

My prediction is that the earnings will be a big swing either way - up or down and it is not likely to trade flat. (Could be wrong). And i am only looking for downside protection.

To protect myself, i could buy the 100 Put for 30-Aug. However, it costs 5.30. And for 1,100 shares, i feel it is a lot to spend 5,830.

Other than buying a PUT or a PUT spread, is there anything else i can do that is cheaper and protects me if NVDA falls below 100?

Thank you!

Update: Some great suggestions and commentary here. Thank you all very much. Based on the advice, I am going to follow the strategy which got me such a low cost basis in the first place. Not look at this position for a year :P.
I already have a 120-130 bull-call spread that i bought a few months ago.

As for Cathie, as everyone knows, she sold most of her NVDA holdings when it was below $15 per share post split. And yet somehow, she gets to manage billions.

1e48n4g_AMZN,AMZN,Two Arguments for Nvidia Stock Going Down,"I found this video, which essentially makes two points why Nvidia Stock is going to face challenges soon. 

1. Concern: Nvidia is building data centers for AI, but these data centers can not yet be used by companies to meet actual end-consumer demands which would be necessary in order to create actual revenue. The idea is that the ""customer (of those data centers) has no customer"". Thus, it has created a bubble, similar to a real estate bubble where many houses are being built without having people who are actually going to live in it.

2. Concern: the author of the video creates some criteria for companies or stocks that are in the danger of a downturn, such as decelerating revenue growth, decelerating earnings growth, margins going down and a high starting valuation, leading to multiple compression.

(Actual Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tRZmfmc8uc)

What do you think about these two arguments/concerns. Are they valid?

1djlasc_AAPL,AAPL,Opinions on DCAing when massively down on NVDA puts? (Long Post),"TL;DR - Down 80% on NVDA puts, but based on recent low volume I believe NVDA may still have a sudden pullback after the recent bull run and considering DCAing to try to breakeven. Wanting opinions to broaden perspective.

---

I bought puts on NVDA the Friday before the split and before its subsequent 13% run-up. (10 buys of 7/19 120p, avg cost $8.04, curr $1.56, -80%)

  
I know. I know. Before I get comments like ""You should have sold earlier"", ""You should have set a stop-loss"", etc. I completely understand that, but at this point it is too late for that, and I still fully believe in my position(although I was definitely too early, if it even pans out at all). This also is not a bubble/dotcom comparison post before everyone calls me an idiot for thinking NVDA is going to spectacularly fail all within a month, I'm simply anticipating a pullback after this post-earnings run. I'm long-term bullish, short-term bearish.

  
To preface, I bullishly ran the entire ride up on NVDA starting in November of last year up until Q1 earnings in May. During this time, I made over $15k in profit on calls up and down using about $2k to start and occasionally took profits to pay some bills each month. The week before the split I unfortunately tried to play the ""sell the news"" of the split that ended up lasting literally only half an hour the morning the split occurred where, at peak, I was just barely profitable when the puts briefly reached $8.30 before the price action decided to have a massive run-up. 

  
Since I have been closely watching pretty much just NVDA alone for almost every trading day since early January, I have a pretty good feel for how the stock acts and reacts among other stocks, news, and volume, albeit I know just as much as anyone else as to what the price will do at any given moment(which is nothing). But based on the history I've observed of NVDA from just this year, I've seen how irrationally it can behave despite there not being any news to cause a large pullback like it has in the past. Particularly on March 8, 2024 where NVDA opened at about $950, ran up to ATH $974(+2.5%) within the first hour and then fell over a period of 2 hours all the way at its lowest to about $865 (pre-split prices of course), -11% intra-day (-$300bil mkt cap), from peak to trough. This day happened to be the second highest volume day in the entire past year at over 1.1b shares traded intra-day (10x adjusted for split).

  
Now that the split has happened, I've noticed that everyday since the split occurred, despite being a lower price to allow more traders to buy NVDA, the volume has been consistently the lowest it's been since literally the week of Christmas 2023, possibly even the lowest it's been in the entire past year \[[NVDA Historical Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/)\]. According to Investopedia: ""[High or increasing volume in an uptrend can signal a buying opportunity. **Decreasing volume in an uptrend may suggest that it's time to sell and take profits.**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/why-trading-volume-important-investors.asp#:~:text=High%20or%20increasing%20volume%20in,to%20sell%20and%20take%20profits)""



Although none of this is guaranteed, based on this information, I still believe that a sudden, but temporary drop can still occur especially during this absolutely crazy post-Q1 run-up, which brings me to the subject of DCAing on my position. 

  
Since I am massively down on my position, but still have a month until my puts expire at the time of me posting this, my next strategy is to DCA to increase the likelihood of reaching breakeven with maybe even a slight chance at actually profiting if a sudden drop occurs. I was possibly looking at buying more this Friday when NVDA will be purchased for a reshuffling of the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLK)) where a projected $11b in NVDA shares will be purchased to rebalance the fund in exchange for AAPL. I anticipate that this day will be yet another buying/green day for NVDA and could possibly be a peak for the short-term price of NVDA after 2 weeks of 15%+ gains. I may not purchase on this day depending on the price action but for now that is my possible plan. Of course, the closer I get to expiration and there doesn't seem to be any pullback I will just have to cut my massive loss and treat it as another learning moment for the future. 

  
Does this seem crazy? Am I grasping at straws? Possibly. But that's why I want more opinions so that I can further educate myself on other possibilities that I'm maybe not thinking of at the moment especially since I'm still relatively in my trading infancy. Thanks.


Edit: today 6/20 ended up being the event I was anticipating. NVDA opened at +4% and after resistance is falling and currently at -2.66%, just like March 8th. this may change throughout the day but was able to DCA my puts in the morning with 5 more buys at $1.48

6/20 - updated position - 15 buys, 7/19 120p Avg cost $5.85, curr $2.50.

6/24 - final update - sold all 15 at $7.09 when NVDA was $119.90, $10,635 total, overall profit of $2,595

1djkfim_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA options - exercise ?,"Have few NVDA 90$C options for November and it‚Äôs currently in good profit. Selling them will attract 35% short term capital gain tax.

Instead I am wondering if I can exercise 1 or 2 of  them right now - will end paying 9000$ for 100 shares. Probably do a 200$ sell call for next year July / August and will collect the premium. I am okay, even if the stock goes higher than 200$ but will end up getting decent profit at 15% long term capital gain tax. 

If the stock is trends to be tanking and I want out, then I can decide buy back the contract and close it out if required.

Do you see any issues with this plan?",2024-06-19,0,7
1dj6opn_NVDA,NVDA,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I‚Äôve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I‚Äôm sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I‚Äôm a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I‚Äôm also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can‚Äôt really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can‚Äôt imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I‚Äôve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that‚Äôs ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia‚Äôs data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company‚Äôs total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It‚Äôs also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company‚Äôs technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang‚Äôs net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup‚Äôs AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidia‚Äôs ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that‚Äôs historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices ‚Äî rather than market caps ‚Äî have outsized influence on the benchmark.

1dit62d_AAPL,AAPL,XLK rebalancing 06/21 NVDA and AAPL,"As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold.¬†

Historically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the¬† ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.

For AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity.¬†

As this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1. This would give you time to capture and news from August 2024 earnings the iPhone 16 release, the post election rally and Xmas spend.¬†",2024-06-18,45,13
1diefni_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA after stock split won‚Äôt be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let‚Äôs look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",2024-06-18,0,14

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)‚Äôs blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on¬†[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the¬†[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)¬†follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday‚Äôs close. The new calculations show¬†[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)¬†as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia‚Äôs weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

‚ÄúUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they‚Äôre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what‚Äôs beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,‚Äù Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

‚ÄúIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,‚Äù Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

1di7kil_NVDA,NVDA,"NVDA will see a near term pullback, even though it doesn't deserve it ","NVDA will pullback in the near term, even though it's a great company that has consistently delivered for its shareholders. Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment.

I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July.

This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched.

Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation.

There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs.

I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy.

I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.

They own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.

If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a¬†[$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html)¬†milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple‚Äôs, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company¬†[reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html)¬†in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia‚Äôs huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company‚Äôs overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple‚Äôs sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again¬†[passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/)¬†earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia‚Äôs stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

1d8y4gs_META,META,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia‚Äôs milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company‚Äôs pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry‚Äôs need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units.

1d7wmef_META,META,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into ‚Äúa leader in AI & robotics,‚Äù an ambition that he‚Äôs said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s ‚Äî Nvidia‚Äôs flagship artificial intelligence chip ‚Äî from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year ‚Äúin combined training and inference AI.‚Äù

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla‚Äôs procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker‚Äôs receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

‚ÄúElon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,‚Äù an Nvidia memo from December said. ‚ÄúIn exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.‚Äù

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk‚Äôs comment on the first-quarter Tesla call ‚Äúconflicts with bookings‚Äù and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also ‚Äúconflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.‚Äù The email referenced news about Tesla‚Äôs ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an ‚ÄúH100 project‚Äù at Tesla‚Äôs Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, ‚ÄúX Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.‚Äù Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with ‚Äúa rebellious streak‚Äù and a would-be competitor to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúantics‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical rants.‚Äù

Tesla‚Äôs stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he‚Äôs been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

‚ÄúIf somebody doesn‚Äôt believe Tesla‚Äôs going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,‚Äù Musk said on the April earnings call. ‚ÄúWe will, and we are.‚Äù

To get there, he‚Äôs said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‚ÄòConsuming every GPU that‚Äôs out there‚Äô

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it‚Äôs hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers ‚Äúare consuming every GPU that‚Äôs out there,‚Äù Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to ‚Äúallocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,‚Äù adding ‚Äúwhy allocate something when the data center‚Äôs not ready?‚Äù

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million ‚ÄúDojo‚Äù supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a ‚Äúsuper dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster‚Äù at the company‚Äôs factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest GPU cluster‚Äù in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a ‚ÄúMusk mandate‚Äù to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI‚Äôs Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI‚Äôs data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk‚Äôs Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn‚Äôt disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he‚Äôd want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

‚ÄúI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can‚Äôt be overturned,‚Äù he said in the post.

Tesla‚Äôs latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company‚Äôs outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he ‚Äúwould prefer to build products outside of Tesla.‚Äù He‚Äôs already doing that at xAI.

Musk‚Äôs comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company‚Äôs largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki‚Äôs Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as ‚Äúblackmail.‚Äù

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

‚ÄúWhen you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,‚Äù Fleming said. ‚ÄúIf you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.‚Äù

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

‚ÄúThat has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,‚Äù Fleming said.

Musk hasn‚Äôt been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla‚Äôs 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia‚Äôs technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

Nvidia, ([NVDA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)) is now larger than:

Nvidia is now just \~17% away from surpassing Apple as the 2nd largest company in the world.

1ct1klo_NVDA,NVDA,"$2,500 Trading $NVDA","Today, the stars aligned perfectly for the bulls, but it all started with a theme change. Prior to yesterday there was a common theme in $NVDA - swipe of liquidity without a reclaim. The swipes occurred on both highs and lows, but yesterday something different happened: a reclaim of the HOD swipe. Reclaim of HOD swipe = buy. 

With CPI data, $NVDA was finally able to break above the heavy 910-920 liquidity zone. This is great and all, but the CPI data was the perfect addition to sustain the market's momentum, and maintain a strong market cycle. During a strong market cycle, bullish themes (repeated behaviors) are front of mind. 

$NVDA had one major theme today: dip buying. Dip buying in a strong market cycle/strong $SPY flows was the perfect recipe for $NVDA to run and capitalize on the long side (longing a call). 

**Trade Details:**

Entry #1: Roll up from yesterday's position (+$610)

Entry/Exit #2 (not pictured) AND Entry #3: Bad cut on Exit #2; I am far from perfect and this is one example of where I need to get better, I paid the price and reentered my initial position for $90 worse on Entry #3 (-$90)

Entry #4: Dip buy into a liquidity zone. The market was very strong today, and NVDA had already exhibited that dip buying was in theme; near perfect entry and why themes/market cycles are important for trading

Exit #4: Reject of HOD based on selling flows on the tape (+$470), (Still holding my entry of 10 contracts with an average price of $1.11)

Entry #5: Dip buy, a little early on this as the next dip was a true liquidity zone test, but I wasn't stopped out.

Exit #5: Exit on the high of day breakout, I exited slightly too early and made a small profit (+$200). I exitied at the breakout because a sustained immediate breakout wasn't in theme; each push had a dip first. 

Entry #6: Dip buy into liquidity zone again, and LOD swipe

Entry #7: Rotation in a strong market cycle = bullish

Exit #6/7: Exit at HOD breakout once again (+$730)

TOTAL: +$1,920 

I am still holding my 10 contracts with an average price of $1.11 overnight that closed at $1.86 (+$750)

OVERALL TOTAL: $2,670

Can anybody elaborate on what Chamath meant by this? 

Why is Nvidia bad at inference? 

Is this about the idea that most of the value accrual will be on the AI application layer as opposed to the AI infrastructure layer? 

But then again - why does he believe NVidia won't succeed with its application layer (e.g., robotics platform, ...)?

Hope somebody can shed some light on these questions!

. . . . . . 

Once known mostly for building PC add-on graphics cards for gamers, Nvidia has transformed its graphics processing units, or GPUs, into the beating heart of the AI revolution, powering the creation of large language models and running the inference software that leverages them in data centers around the world. Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.  
  
But fresh competition is coming‚Äîfrom companies big and small‚Äîand the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That‚Äôs almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.

. . . . . . 

A few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make‚Äîor, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.  
  
Huang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren‚Äôt the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well‚Äîor better‚Äîthan Nvidia.

. . . . . 

Nvidia‚Äôs rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won‚Äôt be winner-take-all. It isn‚Äôt game over. It‚Äôs game on.  
  
Nvidia‚Äôs most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.

this report pulls price action on NVDA for the past 6 months to look at how often price touches the previous week's high, the previous week's low and both the previous week's high and low as well as how often it stays within the range.

what I found was that on average, NVDA has touched its previous week's high 68% of the time and only touched its previous week's low, 32% of the time. 

if you see that price has a tendency to touch last week's high - which in this case it does - you can use this to set targets around that price. 

on the contrary, if you see that price doesn't tend to touch the previous week's low - which is the case here - don't aim to set targets around that price. ",2024-04-07,0,8

1bvx2c0_AMZN,AMZN,Is NVDA and AMZN Overvalued?,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm sure this question gets asked a lot by many others, but wanted to hear some new opinions.

Currently, I‚Äôm working on a model using Excel to capture the intrinsic value of all companies. To do this, I run under the assumption that most of the large companies are currently (more or less) fairly valued. This is how I test to see whether my model is working as intended.

Based on this assumption, I was able to create a formula that pretty much captures the analyst‚Äôs agreed-upon value of most of the large companies, but currently I have Nvidia at around $440 and Amazon at around $75. These assumptions are based on their historical CAGR of cash flows at around 37% and 10% respectively. Now i know historical growth is not necessarily indicative of future growth, but based on my model, Nvidia would have to grow by about 66% YOY and Amazon about 35%

Just want to hear other‚Äôs opinions on whether these growth figures seem fairly accurate, or if that‚Äôs being too generous to these companies that may have already ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù? or am I just wildly off on my assumptions?

If we assume that these growth figures are to be expected, how do you go about updating the growth rate when performing your DCF Analysis?

Thanks!

These assumptions are based on their historical CAGR of cash flows at around 37% and 10% respectively. Now i know historical growth is not necessarily indicative of future growth, but based on my model, Nvidia would have to grow by about 66% YOY and Amazon about 35%

Just want to hear other‚Äôs opinions on whether these growth figures seem fairly accurate, or if that‚Äôs being too generous to these companies that may have already ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù? or am I just wildly off on my assumptions?

If we assume that these growth figures are to be expected, how do you go about updating the growth rate when performing your DCF Analysis?

Thanks!

1bv2is2_NVDA,NVDA,DJT is 1538.41 times Revenues while NVDA is 35.89 times Revenues according to Tikr,"And Nvidia has both phenomenal growth and profits as well as revenues as opposed to little revenue and massive losses like DJT.   But is it safe to short or hold puts given the expected outside investments by nefarious non US dark pools to prop up the stock price to support a potential future POTUS?

As an aside here is a statement by Scott McNeely after Sun Microsystems hit $64 a share in 2000.

*At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends.*  
 *That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company.*   
*That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard.*  
*And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?*   
*Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency.*   
*You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?*

He never had a single losing year, and he returned an average of 30% annually to clients. Very few Wall Street money managers have a track record half that good, and that makes Druckenmiller an excellent case study for investors.

Today, he manages his multibillion-dollar fortune through the Duquesne Family Office. As of the quarter ended in December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his portfolio invested in two ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. **Nvidia** accounted for 9.1% and **Microsoft** accounted for 12% of his invested assets. The size of those positions is a clear sign of high conviction.

this report looks at NVDA's price action on Friday's to see how often price broke out, broke down, didn't break or broke both out and down of the opening 15 minute range in the past 6 months.

what I found was that on Friday's during this period, price never broke both out and down of the 15 minute opening range, nor did it ever stay within it. 

based on the data, I found that price tended to break out (meaning price broke above the opening range first) 65.39% of the time, and only broke down (meaning price broke below the opening range first) 34.62% of the time.

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It‚Äôs fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn‚Äôt it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia‚Äôs margins and the company‚Äôs ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia‚Äôs largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

1axavr6_NVDA,NVDA,Rebalancing Question: Looking to sell Nvidia (NVDA) to exit Verizon (VZ),"TLDR: Should I sell ~40% of my current NVDA position to make an exit from Verizon and break even?

Hey all,

I usually don't like making posts but I need some suggestions on what to do with 2 positions. As a young retail investor in 2020, I got baited by a yield trap dividend stock, Verizon. At the time I was just looking to maximize my passive income and didn't understand the fundamentals (debt, earnings-to-expense ratio). I just got baited by the shiny big yield (6.47%) but the stock has done nothing but depreciate since I bought it. In total, it makes up ~21% of my brokerage account and I have lost about ~20% of the total value I put in. The average purchase price is around $50.97. Again this is in a brokerage.

Fortunately, I struck oil at the same time and bought a lot of NVDA with an average price of $167 (currently at $778). I took out my initial investment and profited when it hit $520 so while I still have a position it is considerably smaller.

My question is do I sell some more NVDA to exit Verizon? I would be selling about 40% of NVDA position just to break even and make a complete exit, with the complete exit I would invest in some value stocks like PEP or PG and maybe some more growth stocks like TSM, PANW, or maybe just QQQM/VOO. I could also reinvest it into my ROTH account which is more focused and has about a 13% return.

I was talking to some friends and they suggested that I just sell the Verizon at a loss and reinvest in NVDA. While I do think it can go higher, I am starting to doubt some of the gas left in the tank for NVDA so it makes me more uncertain.",2024-02-22,1,13

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,‚Äù Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. ‚ÄúDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.‚Äù

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they‚Äôre pretty damn impressive. If it‚Äôs a bubble, it‚Äôs a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It‚Äôs amazing growth for a company so large. 

I‚Äôm hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We‚Äôve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I‚Äôm in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns. And you can choose to ignore them if they are outside your risk and comfort level. That makes perfect sense. But there are compelling reasons to be here as well.",2024-02-21,955,353

1awompn_NVDA,NVDA,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so he'll wipe my ass,"TL;DR: my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4,000 $NVDA shares (1,000 shares pre 4:1 split) in 2018/2019 and am now sitting on >$2.5 million in NVDA.

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it‚Äôs something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly‚Äôs retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy a stock if I can‚Äôt afford 1,000 shares‚Äù. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he‚Äôs also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me ‚Äúhaha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with‚Äù. Thought id share here because I‚Äôm not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included.",2024-02-21,22022,592

The eye-boggling share price and implied volatility/ridiculously expensive premiums means that - even for an option play - people require a sh\*t ton of capital AND have a fairly bold call/put strike price in order to make profit above 10k. And lets be honest is anyone playing NVDA ER for only a small profit in mind?

Isn't the wisest move to do ER options trades for companies with much much lower share prices and a lot less implied volatility?

I get that NVDA's ER is going to be ""the Super Bowl of options"", and that generates a ton of interest and participation, but from a pure risk/reward perspective, NVDA earnings release seems like an event that should be avoided.

1atki12_NVDA,NVDA,Accumulating TSMC to benefit from the NVDA run,"Company seems undervalued from the perspective of its earnings, how far the chip rush could take it, intrinsic value being the custodian of a lot of exclusive technology in this space (Google shifting from Samsung to TSM for their Tensor chips; sure, it's a miniscule part of their business but it looks like Google has deeper propects in mind  in making sure their hardware is well- distributed, Pixel sales are well above average this year) and being the general market leader in manufacturing, but not so from a historical perspective because it's trading just marginally lower than its 5 year high.

Market sentiment is a bit mixed to low from what I can see, with the geopolitical issue with Taiwan coming into play. Stock rises 2%, falls 3 % the very next day (although I've been observing it only close to a month) and that is how I'm gauging sentiment.
I've missed the NVDA bus and NVDA can rise so much so as TSMC can fabricate their designs, so it seems like one can ride off NVDA by acquiring TSM.

1ar26eu_NVDA,NVDA,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It‚Äôs the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker‚Äôs stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google‚Äôs $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques ‚Äî such as transformer architecture ‚Äî used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

1aqqfv2_NVDA,NVDA,Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,"**Why**

The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.

However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.

I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.

I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works

**Positions**

* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06
* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago
* Other more reasonable choices

**Afterword**

Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)

**Edit**

**Edit 2**

* Closed NVD @ 9.27

**Edit 3**

* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways

**Edit 4**

* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  


**Edit 5**

* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? 
* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. 
* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.

1afxwfr_NVDA,NVDA,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",2024-02-01,222,155

1abc41a_NVDA,NVDA,"Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?","


I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. 

For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. 

Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA? Thanks in advance for your insights!",2024-01-26,9,63

On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.

‚ÄúOur long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,‚Äù he wrote in the post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap‚Äù for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta‚Äôs progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.

Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ‚Äôs GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.

A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.

Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta‚Äôs H100 purchases.

The H100 is Nvidia‚Äôs current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.

Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

**Summary of last post:**

Recent IPO, low cap stock with unique technology that reduces video storage costs between 30-50%. Work with 3 top 5 largest media companies in the world (including Netflix, publicly shared). 

Hold 53 AI patents and have received awards for their revolutionary technology.

Announced partnership with $NVDA, who are working with them to launch a SaaS product available to a broader market (moving from software licensing to a SaaS-based billing model, with easy access). 

The stock popped 6 X on the day of the announcement. 

Currently in BETA and will launch the product in Q1, 2024. Proved market fit and set grounds for monopolising the media industry. 

Please see for more info on the original post here (including upcoming catalyst, investors, Management etc.)

**Quick Numbers:**

Share Price: $1.22 (since last post 1.21, good support)

TP: $6-8 (if you catch PoPs during catalyst) ‚Äì official TP by investment bank set at 5$ by the end of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

Since the post, there have been a few updates (gathered from their social channels and other sources rather than official shareholder updates ‚Äì expect this very soon as there is a LOT). All links for references have been provided below (for fact-checking üòä ).

The bulleted list is expanded in below:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Featured on NASDAQ as top 5 best-emerging growth stocks 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Started to hire Sales executives for SaaS product launch 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† CTO participating at Video Scale Conference panel discussion with 3 x $META employees (one of their not publicly announced customers‚Ä¶ hmmm?) 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $NVDA officially shared more details of their partnership with $BMR and technical details of the solution for video rendering. 

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $BMR announces to support Machine Learning video operations.

**Featured on NASDAQ as top 5 best-emerging growth stocks** 

Beamr‚Äôs CEO Sharon Carmel presented at the ThinkEquity conference on October 19th in New York. 

In short, this conference is leveraged by top investment banks/firms to identify investment opportunities in low-cap, emerging stocks. This event is held yearly, and results are publicly shared of how much investment each stock has received (investment range from $1.5 million to $100 million) 

Obviously, there is a delay in presenting/getting known amongst investors and receiving investment. Firms must do their due diligence. However, it is evident this event gathers investors as transactions are publicly shared on their website as a result of the event with roughly 2-3 new investments made by every month. 

So, we may not expect an investment firm to throw money at $BMR in the next month, however, we can assume this will happen in 2024. 

Why can we assume so? Well, for one, they do really solve a real issue with innovative products and many other reasons listed at the start of the post. I won‚Äôt go into detail, but it‚Äôs safe to assume they have gathered interest in order for NASDAQ to officially list $BMR as one of the top 5 emerging stocks out of the list of 75, suggesting they got something in the bag. 

**Started to hire Sales executives for SaaS product launch** 

This is an interesting one, they launched a BETA version in autumn to test their APIs and a bunch of other things to improve, adjust their SaaS etc. This is a free trial with a very easy way to reduce video storage costs. We can assume the trial version has gathered 100s if not 1000s of new users to test out their product in an autonomous fashion. 

In sales, this is the easiest way to gather customers. Pumping new sales executives with warm leads. 

Alongside that, they are starting to ramp up for launch, hiring new sales executives. They have posted job ads on LinkedIn and now have closed them off (for 1 Sales role, they received 150 applications).

**CTO participating at Video Scale Conference panel discussion with 3 x $META employees (one of their not publicly announced customers‚Ä¶ hmmm?)** 

This is a yearly event that brings top industry technology engineers to discuss the future of video technology: current challenges, things to solve and the outlook. 

Everyone technical tunes in to this event, this is a platform to learn from top industry peers. And Yes, the CTO from $BMR is amongst the panel members that includes $META engineers. This is an immense amount of exposure they are receiving, being recognized as one of the top video technology companies. 

They are surrounded by GIANTS, and makes me wonder if they are, too, working with META? You don‚Äôt just get randomly invited to such panel discussions showcasing how innovative your technology stack is. 

**$NVDA officially shared more details of their partnership with $BMR and technical details of the solution for video rendering.** 

$BMR, a few days ago, shared a technical post from $NVDA of how they customised their GPUs to work with $BMR technology to reduce video storage costs (I won‚Äôt get into details here as it is too technical, and you can read all about it in the link below to $NVDA website post). 

In short, Nvidia would not invest resources or time and collaborate to some random, questionable technology businesses to customise their GPUs. This is a big, meaty thing‚Ä¶. Ask yourself, why would a multi-billion company partner with a low cap, recent IPO stock‚Ä¶. They are recognizing something big here. 

**$BMR announces support for Machine Learning video operations.** 

Short and snappy, too technical here (details in the references section). Machine learning as you may be aware, is key to AI development. What $BMR shared is that they are now fully compatible with ML models that reduce storage requirements, applying their cost optimization for AI.

In this case I am speaking more to the AI compute devices although regular GPU's could share this fact.
Over the past couple quarters they have seen greater %gains each time, Q4 of 14% and Q1 24 of 25%. Most of this is attributed to the recent ChatGPT boom although overall this year has been noticeably different in terms of ai hype.

14ora88_NVDA,NVDA,"Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?","In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated. 

As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.

To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:

Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.

These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.

	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued.
	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation.
	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.

To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.

AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.

Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.

AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.

Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:

AVGO Annual Income Statement:

	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million
	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million

NVDA Annual Income Statement:

	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million
	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million

Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.

In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.

These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.

Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.

Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.

While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.",2023-07-02,125,65

Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.

Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:

EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected
Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected
Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.

Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.

Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.

However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.

Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.

Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.

*Personal take*: I don‚Äôt even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.

AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it‚Äôs just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.",2023-05-25,1368,371

The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.

Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

When I look at these companies, I do not understand how Nvidia could be priced where it is now. The two big areas of growth people seem to have for Nvidia is the self driving space and the metaverse. Self driving is years away from being viable and there are many players. Isn't metaverse the exact thing that has demolished $FB's market cap? How can you be bullish on one and bearish on the other for the exact same thing?

Earnings are next week and everything seems to scream this is going under. At the same time I am remembering that markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent.

sf53wg_NVDA,NVDA,INTC vs. AMD vs. TSM and I guess NVDA,"A nice buffett of semiconductors. I don't want someone to ""do the homework"". I've mentioned that before, I want to learn how to better value a company.

But I'm struggling with the basics on the semis right now. INTC P/E is perfect for the coming inflation storm.

The margin isn't bad, the growth is going to pick-up, that's the point of CAPEX and building future capacity.

So why is it that of all of them, INTC is the dog with fleas?

What am I missing? Is slightly less profit margin really that big of an issue? Its business departments have been growing well as well. And frankly, as the US shifts from import to made in the USA, INTC is the only option.

AMD I think is getting hammered precisely because its overvalued and its future is more bleak than people may think.",2022-01-29,80,268

rbric4_NVDA,NVDA,Why is NVDA so richly valued?,"Hi everyone, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a new investor around 3-months and that I'm not dogging anyone's investment decisions. I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.

However, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?

Wouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT.

I acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding.

Cheers everyone.",2021-12-08,241,266

qx1l1a_NVDA,NVDA,I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don‚Äôt know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they‚Äôre doing which I‚Äôm sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation‚Ä¶

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia‚Äôs multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants ‚ÄúEvery transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU‚Äù While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU‚Äôs.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It‚Äôs definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia‚Äôs $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

>The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

>Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvda/amd's surge to capture Intel market share?

Okay, no position in NVDA yet, but I plan on buying 2020 puts on it. They are way overvalued and too much future success has already been priced in. Why?

1.) Nvidia's pillar is AI in all its forms: data center training/inference, autonomous cars etc. Right now they are a monopoly charging monopoly prices. But their monopoly position will be aggressively challenged this year by Graphcore, AMD, Nervana (acquired by Intel), and Google's in-house TPU. Data center providers are still salty about Intel's monopoly on CPUs and will do all they can to avoid the same thing repeating with GPUs. We can already see that with Google's in-house level. I can only assume that AWS/MSFT are either doing something too or scoping out an AI chip startup to acquire (there are lots of those around). I doubt Nvidia will realize monopoly profits of the next two years that are already priced into the stock today.

2.) Look at Nvidia's revenue vs market cap. Now look at Intel's. Intel is actually a very similar company - most revenues come from selling to data centers (top top CPUs), to gamers (top CPUs) with some for personal computing (avg CPUs). Intel has had ZERO competition for years, only now is AMD a threat. For NVDA's revenue to market cap ratio to look like Intel's, its revenues would have to 5x (not an exact number, but you get the point). Highly unlikely to happen, especially due to new competition from point 1 above.

3.) Market will crash, most probably by 2020.

4.) Crypto will crash.

5.) Autonomous cars are decades away. Maybe California will have them within 10 years, MAYBE. The rest of America will take another 10 years with the rest of the world another 50 years after that.

I can elaborate more on the 1st point since I'm part of the deep learning community and that's kind of where I got that insight from, since my friends and I often talk about upcoming products from competitors since Nvidia GPUs are so damn expensive due to crypto.

As I said, I haven't taken a position yet since for the next few months I'll be liquidating my most of my current portfolio. At that time I will look to add Jan 2020 puts to my portfolio.... unless you convince me otherwise ;)

5thd7i_NVDA,NVDA,NVDA is a Dangerous Play,"I just wanted to offer my thoughts on Nvidia.  I'm still relatively new to this so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

NVDA has had a P/E ratio nearly as high as it does now in the past: http://www.stocktradersdaily.com/stockchart/NVDA/pe-ratio

It always ends up shrinking back to sanity.  ""But Nvidia has massive growth potential"", you say.  They're getting into cars and stuff, right?  It's not the overall size of the company that matters, but the growth rate- which actually correlates quite well with the rise and fall of the P/E: http://www.stocktradersdaily.com/stockchart/NVDA/yearlygrowth

The key thing to notice here is the P/E drops long before the earnings growth rate drops.


In addition, its PEG is remarkably stable: http://www.stocktradersdaily.com/stockchart/NVDA/peg-ratio

(you see that little blip up at the end?  Given its extremely stable PEG for the last several years, odds are high it will self correct, meaning the price will drop).

Analysts are predicting a slowdown in that growth rate, hence a shrinking of its P/E.  Which means its price has to shrink to meet that lower ratio.  

You might want to believe NVDA will break its decade long trend, but the reality is market price is determined by its participants, who all see and react to the same patterns.  The probability of it shooting to the moon at this point is very low, and holding it in such hopes is basically a gamble with the odds set against you.

If you've been holding NVDA long, this might be a good time to sell.  Analyst price targets are hovering around $120-130, so if you're really stubborn I'd wait until it hits $120 and then sell everything off.

In the unlikely event NVDA shoots up, well so be it, you made a smart play.  There are many other opportunities to take advantage of.  If you want to make yourself feel better, watch as it sinks back down even faster.",2017-02-11,9,10
