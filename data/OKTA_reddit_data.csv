1kndi5b_OKTA,OKTA,"Okta: Short-term bullish, long-term… TBD — Quick review of its services and results","I was checking  $OKTA and found some interesting stuff, I thought I’d share a quick recap.  


So, Okta’s stock jumped 22.3% on March 4, 2025, which got a bunch of analysts to bump their price targets. That move, plus strong Q4 earnings, seems to have flipped sentiment a bit.



They reported $682M in Q4 revenue, with $670M from subscriptions, and came in at $0.78 EPS, which beat Wall Street expectations. They also posted a net income of $28M, a nice turnaround from previous losses. Also worth noting: they’ve got a $4.2B subscription backlog and are guiding [FY2026](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/OKTA/earnings/#google_vignette) revenue between $2.85B and $2.86B.  


From a technical view, they’re trading above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which usually signals [bullish momentum](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/okta/technical-analysis).



That said, analysts are kinda split. Some are raising targets — BTIG ($123), Barclays ($115), Mizuho ($127), and DA Davidson ($125, up from $90) — but others like J.P. Morgan and Jefferies are holding at $110 with a more cautious outlook. Basically: bullish in the short term, but mixed feelings going into 2026–2030 due to macro pressure, competition, and execution risks.



Security-wise, Okta’s been working hard to recover from a string of high-profile breaches (LAPSU$, Oktapus, MGM, Cloudflare, etc.). Those hits hurt both trust and the stock. [They recently settled for $60M](https://11th.com/cases/okta-investor-settlement) over past breaches and have been rolling out new security features to regain credibility — like Identity Threat Protection, Phishing-Resistant MFA, and a bunch of upgrades across their Customer Identity Cloud and Workforce Identity Cloud.



They’re also diving into AI-driven risk detection and threat response, aiming to improve real-time security posture and reduce attack surface.



So yeah — Okta looks like it’s in a solid place right now, showing real growth, improved margins, and [product innovation](https://www.okta.com/newsroom/press-releases/okta-introduces-innovations-to-help-companies-harden-their-security/). But with all the past baggage and long-term uncertainty, it’s fair to wonder whether they can hold the momentum or if this is just a strong bounce before new headwinds.



So, what are your bets on this? Do you think they can keep the good news coming?",2025-05-15,1,5

1hgcuo5_OKTA,OKTA,⚡️To All Okta Investors: New Investigation Into Okta’s Data Breach ⚡️,"Hey guys, I found some info about a new investigation against Okta over last year’s full data breach, where they hid details for weeks. 

First things first — on October 20, 2023, Okta announced in its [security blog](https://sec.okta.com/articles/2023/10/tracking-unauthorized-access-oktas-support-system) that hackers gained access to Okta’s user data between September 28 and October 17, 2023, causing an 11.6% drop in its stock price.

BeyondTrust detected the data breach on October 02, 2023. However, it took over two weeks for Okta to confirm it, even though it had happened since September 28 (they informed customers on October 19 and the general public on October 20, 2023).

They initially claimed that only 1% of its clients were affected, but, by November 29, (more than a month after the first announcement) Okta revealed that [the hack exposed data for all clients](https://sec.okta.com/october-security-incident-recommended-actions). After that and since the initial disclosure, $OKTA dropped over 20%.

With all this on the table, investors are filing a lawsuit against Okta over hiding information about the hack in its initial damage assessment, which, in the end, contributed to worsening the losses.

1e0kwdf_OKTA,OKTA,Cybersecurity - OKTA and PANW,Cybersecurity as a sector has severely underperformed the tech sector in 2024. In the past few days there has been an intense sell off leading to some names being down 4-8%. I’ve seen this over the past few years where this sector underperforms for a period of time before roaring upwards for 6-12 months. I think now is a decent time to layer into shares. PANW is my usual accumulate on down cycles play but I also really like Okta at the moment. It’s forward PE and P/S are ultra competitive in this sector and I also like the fact that they had a really nice beat and raise quarter last earnings report yet are still down 6% from that pre earnings price. I plan on buying both but would love to hear the pros and cons of these two companies or the sector as a whole. For you ultra value investor fanboys yes I know the PE of cybersecurity as a whole is high but it’s PEG is still much better than many tech favorites and it trades at a premium knowing cybersecurity continues to be ultra stable and something every major company must spend on. That’s my opinion at least. Let the roasting begin lol.,2024-07-11,10,12

165f733_OKTA,OKTA,"Expected moves and more: Salesforce, Okta, Chewy and Crowdstrike","The indices are flat to start this Wednesday. Some important economic data just dropped but it doesn't seem to be moving markets too much. GDP was revised lower and ADP jobs was lower than expected. The US 1 and 2-year yields are down slightly.

Today we have a slew of earnings after the bell, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike headlining, but also Okta, Chewy, Five Below and more. See below for current expected moves. We looked at CRM yesterday so let's cover CRWD today. Here's the current expected move chart: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1kkyq5339lb1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd94ea845432412c82053680e96b56f1786cf3b3

The expected move of 7% compares to recent actual moves of -2%,  
 \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.

The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

An Iron Condor, selling the 7% move would need the stock to stay between $134 and $160 essentially. With max gain between $136 and $157.50. It risks about $3 to make $2.

13wrcad_CRM,CRM,"Earning plays for CRWD, CRM, AI, OKTA, and JWN","*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. 

Starting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.

CrowdStrike’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter’s top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.

Moreover, CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter bottom line.

Next is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company’s guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% gain.

Similarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company’s outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.

Salesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.

The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.

Salesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.

Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.

However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.

On May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  

Rangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce’s quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.

Despite that, Rangan noted, “As a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.” Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.

I know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?

C3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company’s fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.

C3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.

With its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Aside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company’s $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company’s business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.

Those initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, ""Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.” The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.

For the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.

The company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there’s a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.

As noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.

The Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company’s consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock’s near-term direction.

Strong demand for the company’s Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.

The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.

Okta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products’ ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.

Demand for the company’s solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.

However, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.

Finally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.

Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.

In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.

Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

**So what to do for earnings?**

Just to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I'm getting puts on JWN. I don't expect all of them to hit, I just like to throw my money on the table and see what flies. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction.

I may add more to these depending on what happens with at the bottom of this hour.  
I went through their financials and liked what I saw to open this play.

Their previous guidance was very damning, excerpt below.

[This justified the steep decline in price from last earnings, but does that mean everything is already priced in due to the efficient market theory? My answer would be... NO](https://preview.redd.it/0zijzyy5s43a1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=97382df3e69e5c6ea393568f59298e508e197795)

Given the large number of tech lay offs, guidance for certain will be bleak.  
I'm not even focusing on the estimated EPS/revenue either, b/c what makes this play profitable will be the guidance alone.

Feel free to scour through the financial statements, I wish I could do a proper write up but I am on limited time.

I haven't decided whether I will add more puts, or short sale this thing.

Okta, an authentication company used by thousands of organizations around the world, says it’s investigating news of a potential breach, [*Reuters* reports](https://www.reuters.com/technology/authentication-services-firm-okta-says-it-is-investigating-report-breach-2022-03-22/). The disclosure comes as hacking group Lapsus$ has posted screenshots to its Telegram channel claiming to be of Okta’s internal systems, including one that appears to show Okta’s Slack channels, and another with a Cloudflare interface.

Any hack of Okta could have major ramifications for the companies, universities, and government agencies that depend upon Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.

Writing in its Telegram channel, Lapsus$ claims to have had “Superuser/Admin” access to Okta’s systems for two months, but said its focus was “only on Okta customers.” [*The Wall Street Journal* notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/okta-investigates-reports-of-a-digital-breach-11647931174?mod=hp_lista_pos2) that in a recent filing Okta said it had over 15,000 customers around the world. It lists the likes of Peloton, Sonos, T-Mobile, and the FCC as customers [on its website](https://www.okta.com/customers/).

In a statement sent to *The Verge*, Okta spokesperson Chris Hollis downplayed the incident, and said Okta has not found evidence of an ongoing attack. “In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor.” Hollis said. “We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event.”

“Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January,” Hollis continued. However, writing in their Telegram channel, [Lapsus$ suggested](https://twitter.com/_mg_/status/1506117831095586818?s=21) that it had access for a few months.",2022-03-22,325,36

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.",2021-09-01,63,18

**Growth & Opportunities**

Okta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  ""We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.""

Just recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.

Okta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.

As president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.

**Price Target**

March 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.

[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \~4%) with tops being at $313.

**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",2021-01-17,6,5

Each of them will likely see increased value over the next 5 years, so I'm curious if this is a buy now, as opposed to waiting until the majority of the workforce starts returning to the office (a month, 3 months, 6 months? who knows).",2020-06-15,8,19

OKTA at ATH currently but hear me out. Some of this is priced in but there is still room for growth especially after Cisco's earnings call statements regarding MFA services (see section 5.1)

&#x200B;

1. OKTA provides platform agnostic cloud-based multi-factor authentication for end-users with a focus on secure remote resource access.
2. The world has been moving towards MFA/2FA for a few years now and Covid-19 is going to this product segment into the stratosphere.
3. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/work-from-home-productivity-gain-has-tech-ceos-predicting-many-workers-will-never-come-back-to-the-office-2020-05-15](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/work-from-home-productivity-gain-has-tech-ceos-predicting-many-workers-will-never-come-back-to-the-office-2020-05-15)
   1. Tech CEOs are predicting many works will never come back to the office. This is because many large organization are making significant investments in cloud infrastructure and secure remote access products, many of which require minimum one-year (and most multi-year) contracts to make fiscal sense for the purchasing entity, i.e. ROIC.
4. If you've been tracking their stock price for the last 3 months you'll see that it is a total beast. It's upward momentum was neglibligy impacted by last weeks bear run. It's momentum will likely continue through earnings and possibly beyond. 
5. Cisco offers a competitive platform that they purchased in 2018 known as DUO. If you look at Cisco's most recent earnings report you will notice they had a huge boom in two security areas: DUO and Umbrella. DUO being the OKTA competitor and Umbrella being a DNS-based cloud security offering. 

* From the Cisco earnings call ""Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.""
* What does Cisco have the OKTA doesn't? A metric-ton of hardware liabilities potentially dragging them down. OKTA is cloud infrastructure with an SLA that can't be impacted by physical production roadblocks.
* OKTA is also more competitively priced than DUO for organizations.
