1kven6n_NVDA,NVDA,Oracle to spend $40 billion on Nvidia chips for OpenAI data center - FT,"Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) plans to invest approximately $40 billion in high-performance chips from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power OpenAI’s new AI-focused data center in Texas, according to a report from The Financial Times. The move underscores the accelerating arms race among tech giants to secure the infrastructure needed to support next-generation artificial intelligence models.

The facility, located in Abilene, Texas, is part of a $500 billion initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank Group. As the first Stargate U.S. site, the data center is expected to support 1.2 gigawatts of computing power when fully operational by mid-2026.

Oracle intends to acquire roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips, the company’s most advanced processors for AI training and inference. Rather than operate the center directly, Oracle will lease the computing capacity to OpenAI under a reported 15-year agreement.

The Texas site will be among the world’s largest when completed, solidifying both Oracle’s and OpenAI’s ambitions in large-scale infrastructure.

The announcement follows a separate collaboration unveiled this week between the three companies, alongside G42, SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), to build Stargate UAE, a 1-gigawatt AI cluster headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The UAE facility will be housed within the larger UAE–U.S. AI Campus and is designed to support global-scale AI advancement across industries.

As chip demand surges, Oracle’s multi-year investment signals confidence not only in Nvidia’s hardware but also in OpenAI’s ability to lead the next era of compute-intensive applications. “AI is the most transformative force of our time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week. “With Stargate, we are building the infrastructure to power the future.""",2025-05-25,88,20

1jkqzaa_ORCL,ORCL,Not The Onion : Trump Says He Could Cut China Tariffs to Secure TikTok Deal $ORCL,,2025-03-27,1444,160
1j8fi18_ORCL,ORCL,Oracle misses on earnings and issues weak revenue guidance,"Oracle issued quarterly results on Monday that trailed analysts’ estimates and gave a forecast that came up short of expectations.

Here is how Oracle did compared to LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.49 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.13 billion vs. $14.39 billion expected

Revenue increased 6% from $13.3 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose 22% to $2.94 billion, or $1.02 a share, from $2.4 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 10% from a year earlier to $11.01 billion, accounting for 78% of total sales.

The company’s cloud infrastructure segment, which helps businesses move workloads out of their own data centers, has been booming due to demand for computing power that can support artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit increased 49% from a year earlier to $2.7 billion.

“We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,” Oracle Chair Larry Ellison said in a release. “Customer demand is at record levels.”

In January, President Donald Trump announced plans to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. in collaboration with Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. The first initiative of the joint venture, called Stargate, will be to construct data centers in Texas, an effort that is already underway, Ellison said during the announcement at the White House.

Oracle said it has more than $130 billion in remaining performance obligations after signing $48 billion in contracts during the period. That excludes contracts related to Stargate, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the call with analysts.

Oracle will spend around $16 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is a little more than double the total from last year, Catz added.

“As always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends,” Catz said.

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue to grow of between 8% and 10%. Analysts were expecting growth of about 11% to $15.91 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.65 per share. Analysts were calling for adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.

Catz said Oracle’s fourth quarter adjusted earnings projections were negatively impacted by losses from an investment in another company.

Oracle’s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, down 10% year over year.

The company also said it is increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents.

As of Monday’s close, Oracle’s stock is down almost 11% year to date.

# Google’s Quantum Chip Willow Stuns the World 

Five minutes. That’s how long it took Google’s latest quantum chip, Willow, to solve a problem that would’ve kept the world’s best supercomputers grinding away for 10 septillion years—yes, septillion. While that might sound like a flex without a purpose, it’s a major leap toward making quantum computing commercially useful.

**Qubits, But Make Them Work**

Quantum computing isn’t just sci-fi anymore. Google’s Willow chip tackled the tech’s Achilles’ heel: scaling without drowning in errors. 

Unlike regular bits (your standard 1s and 0s), qubits can exist in multiple states at once, offering ridiculous speed-ups for tasks like drug discovery, nuclear simulations, and—ironically—building better quantum computers. Willow’s big win? Adding more qubits without breaking the system. For the first time, more power didn’t equal more chaos.

**Stocks and Supercomputers**

Wall Street loved the news. Alphabet’s stock popped 5.6% on Tuesday, its biggest rally since April. Analysts cheered the milestone as a signal that Google is still a tech powerhouse, even as rivals like IBM and Amazon race to claim the quantum crown. Meanwhile, smaller quantum players like Rigetti Computing rode Alphabet’s coattails, with Rigetti shares skyrocketing 45%.

But don’t expect quantum computing to replace your MacBook anytime soon. Willow is still experimental, and mainstream adoption is years off. Still, this win positions Google as a frontrunner in what could be the next trillion-dollar tech race.

**The Quantum-verse Ahead**

What’s next? Google’s looking to solve a “real-world, beyond-classical” problem—one no classical computer could handle. Think unlocking new drugs or optimizing supply chains at a scale we can barely imagine. And let’s not ignore the cybersecurity elephant in the room: quantum computers could crack today’s strongest encryptions, which is why Apple’s already working on quantum-proofing iMessage.

For now, quantum remains a playground for big brains and bigger budgets, but with breakthroughs like Willow, it’s clear the future of computing is arriving at warp speed.

# Oracle's Cloudy Day

Oracle’s stock just hit a rough patch, sliding 6.7%—its steepest drop this year—after posting earnings that left Wall Street less than thrilled. Despite a stellar 69% rally in 2024 (its best since the dot-com era), the database titan missed some lofty expectations.

**The Numbers Game**

* Revenue: $14.06 billion (+9% YoY), just shy of the $14.1 billion estimate.
* Adjusted EPS: $1.47, a penny below expectations.
* Cloud infrastructure: A bright spot, with revenue jumping 52% to $2.4 billion.

Even with these solid gains, Oracle’s guidance for next quarter came in lighter than hoped, with projected revenue of $14.3 billion missing Wall Street’s $14.65 billion target.

**What Went Right (and Wrong)**

Oracle’s cloud business has been the growth engine, riding the AI wave with big-name clients like Meta and TikTok. But here’s the rub: Scaling up to meet demand isn’t cheap. The company shelled out nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures this quarter to build its data centers, raising some eyebrows on Wall Street.

Still, Oracle isn’t crying over spilled capex. Meta recently signed a deal to use Oracle’s infrastructure for its Llama AI models, and the company projects 50% growth in its cloud business for next year.

**The Bigger Picture**

While this quarter wasn’t perfect, analysts see Oracle’s long-term AI play as promising. Piper Sandler even upped their price target to $210, citing strong cloud momentum. So, while investors may be feeling the sting today, Oracle’s future still looks bright—if it can keep up with its competitors in the cloud race.

Oracle’s earnings might have stumbled, but its cloud ambitions are still flying high. For now, Wall Street’s patience seems to be holding.

# 

# Inflation — Still Hanging Around Like That Guest Who Won’t Leave

The CPI report dropping tomorrow is expected to show inflation holding firm at an annualized 2.7% for November. Core CPI—excluding food and energy—looks to stay steady at 3.3%, which means the Fed’s dream of a 2% inflation target isn’t quite ready for prime time.

**Why This Matters**

The Fed has been slicing interest rates like it’s carving a holiday turkey, with two cuts already in the books this year and whispers of another quarter-point trim next week. Futures markets are betting heavily (88% odds) that Jerome Powell will deliver. But with inflation progress slowing, some analysts wonder if the Fed should tap the brakes on its rate-cutting spree.

**What’s Driving Prices Up?**

Goldman Sachs pointed to the usual suspects: car prices (+2% in November), airfares (+1%), and that ever-irritating auto insurance (+0.5% for the month). Sure, inflation is way down from its 9% peak in 2022, but persistent price increases still feel like a splinter under the skin for many consumers, especially those on tight budgets.

**Looking Ahead**

Economists are split on what 2025 holds. On one hand, easing in housing rentals and autos might give inflation some breathing room. On the other, Trump’s proposed tariffs could shake things up, keeping core CPI stubbornly high at 2.7% for the year. Add potential tax cuts and immigration policy shifts to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for more inflation drama.

So, what’s next? Tomorrow’s CPI report could either solidify the Fed’s plan to cut rates—or throw in a curveball. Stay tuned for the 8:30 a.m. ET drop, because this report might just dictate whether 2025 starts with cautious optimism or a side of economic uncertainty.

# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Still talking about inflation? Unfortunately, yes. Tomorrow’s CPI report is the last data drop before the Fed huddles up next week to decide on its next rate move.

While inflation’s grip has loosened compared to the peaks of recent years, the final stretch is proving tricky, with shelter prices refusing to play nice. November’s inflation is expected to rise 0.2%, matching October. If the number creeps higher, a December rate cut might be wishful thinking for investors.

# After Market Close: 

* **Adobe** should be thriving in the AI boom, but its stock is down this year despite steady earnings and revenue. The challenge? Slowing growth and rising competition from AI-powered tools that make it easier for creators to bypass Adobe’s pricey software.Investors are looking for reassurance that Adobe can keep its edge in this crowded field. With earnings expectations at $4.67 per share and $5.54 billion in revenue, management will need to show it’s not just keeping pace but leading the pack. ($ADBE)",2024-12-10,1,0

# Oracle's Cloudy Day

Oracle’s stock just hit a rough patch, sliding 6.7%—its steepest drop this year—after posting earnings that left Wall Street less than thrilled. Despite a stellar 69% rally in 2024 (its best since the dot-com era), the database titan missed some lofty expectations.

**The Numbers Game**

* Revenue: $14.06 billion (+9% YoY), just shy of the $14.1 billion estimate.
* Adjusted EPS: $1.47, a penny below expectations.
* Cloud infrastructure: A bright spot, with revenue jumping 52% to $2.4 billion.

Even with these solid gains, Oracle’s guidance for next quarter came in lighter than hoped, with projected revenue of $14.3 billion missing Wall Street’s $14.65 billion target.

**What Went Right (and Wrong)**

Oracle’s cloud business has been the growth engine, riding the AI wave with big-name clients like Meta and TikTok. But here’s the rub: Scaling up to meet demand isn’t cheap. The company shelled out nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures this quarter to build its data centers, raising some eyebrows on Wall Street.

Still, Oracle isn’t crying over spilled capex. Meta recently signed a deal to use Oracle’s infrastructure for its Llama AI models, and the company projects 50% growth in its cloud business for next year.

**The Bigger Picture**

While this quarter wasn’t perfect, analysts see Oracle’s long-term AI play as promising. Piper Sandler even upped their price target to $210, citing strong cloud momentum. So, while investors may be feeling the sting today, Oracle’s future still looks bright—if it can keep up with its competitors in the cloud race.

Oracle’s earnings might have stumbled, but its cloud ambitions are still flying high. For now, Wall Street’s patience seems to be holding.

# Inflation — Still Hanging Around Like That Guest Who Won’t Leave

The CPI report dropping tomorrow is expected to show inflation holding firm at an annualized 2.7% for November. Core CPI—excluding food and energy—looks to stay steady at 3.3%, which means the Fed’s dream of a 2% inflation target isn’t quite ready for prime time.

**Why This Matters**

The Fed has been slicing interest rates like it’s carving a holiday turkey, with two cuts already in the books this year and whispers of another quarter-point trim next week. Futures markets are betting heavily (88% odds) that Jerome Powell will deliver. But with inflation progress slowing, some analysts wonder if the Fed should tap the brakes on its rate-cutting spree.

**What’s Driving Prices Up?**

Goldman Sachs pointed to the usual suspects: car prices (+2% in November), airfares (+1%), and that ever-irritating auto insurance (+0.5% for the month). Sure, inflation is way down from its 9% peak in 2022, but persistent price increases still feel like a splinter under the skin for many consumers, especially those on tight budgets.

**Looking Ahead**

Economists are split on what 2025 holds. On one hand, easing in housing rentals and autos might give inflation some breathing room. On the other, Trump’s proposed tariffs could shake things up, keeping core CPI stubbornly high at 2.7% for the year. Add potential tax cuts and immigration policy shifts to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for more inflation drama.

So, what’s next? Tomorrow’s CPI report could either solidify the Fed’s plan to cut rates—or throw in a curveball. Stay tuned for the 8:30 a.m. ET drop, because this report might just dictate whether 2025 starts with cautious optimism or a side of economic uncertainty.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Still talking about inflation? Unfortunately, yes. Tomorrow’s CPI report is the last data drop before the Fed huddles up next week to decide on its next rate move.

While inflation’s grip has loosened compared to the peaks of recent years, the final stretch is proving tricky, with shelter prices refusing to play nice. November’s inflation is expected to rise 0.2%, matching October. If the number creeps higher, a December rate cut might be wishful thinking for investors.

# Google’s Quantum Chip Willow Stuns the World 

Five minutes. That’s how long it took Google’s latest quantum chip, Willow, to solve a problem that would’ve kept the world’s best supercomputers grinding away for 10 septillion years—yes, septillion. While that might sound like a flex without a purpose, it’s a major leap toward making quantum computing commercially useful.

**Qubits, But Make Them Work**

Quantum computing isn’t just sci-fi anymore. Google’s Willow chip tackled the tech’s Achilles’ heel: scaling without drowning in errors. 

Unlike regular bits (your standard 1s and 0s), qubits can exist in multiple states at once, offering ridiculous speed-ups for tasks like drug discovery, nuclear simulations, and—ironically—building better quantum computers. Willow’s big win? Adding more qubits without breaking the system. For the first time, more power didn’t equal more chaos.

**Stocks and Supercomputers**

Wall Street loved the news. Alphabet’s stock popped 5.6% on Tuesday, its biggest rally since April. Analysts cheered the milestone as a signal that Google is still a tech powerhouse, even as rivals like IBM and Amazon race to claim the quantum crown. Meanwhile, smaller quantum players like Rigetti Computing rode Alphabet’s coattails, with Rigetti shares skyrocketing 45%.

But don’t expect quantum computing to replace your MacBook anytime soon. Willow is still experimental, and mainstream adoption is years off. Still, this win positions Google as a frontrunner in what could be the next trillion-dollar tech race.

**The Quantum-verse Ahead**

What’s next? Google’s looking to solve a “real-world, beyond-classical” problem—one no classical computer could handle. Think unlocking new drugs or optimizing supply chains at a scale we can barely imagine. And let’s not ignore the cybersecurity elephant in the room: quantum computers could crack today’s strongest encryptions, which is why Apple’s already working on quantum-proofing iMessage.

For now, quantum remains a playground for big brains and bigger budgets, but with breakthroughs like Willow, it’s clear the future of computing is arriving at warp speed.

1haj1zi_ORCL,ORCL,TikTok trade part 2: Oracle Puts ⭐️3 ,"I bought the TikTok meta play 3 weeks ago but sold my original calls and re-bought last week as Meta sank post election. I missed out on a possible 10X play by not timing buying and selling in line with the news cycle. Sorry I should have wrote a deep dive about this ages ago however I’m a relative rookie and I was unsure how it would play out so I bitched out. 

I ended up making $3K in profit from $500 investment but I sold early missing out on even more gains however the TikTok ban looks to be a multi part play so there is more to eat from the table.

This is a trend that will play out over the next 3 months with Supreme Court request, Jan 19 ban and Trump inauguration and I believe part 2 is here already.

ORCL has nearly doubled in the last 12 months but this is also in line with many AI/Tech stocks. However this means the street is expecting perfection and any negative news in guidance can see this fall. Company’s are obligated legally to let shareholders know of any risks and Tiktok will be sure to get a mention on the call. If investors even get a whiff that revenue is lower due to them losing TikTok data management their guidance is cooked. Even though TikTok is only 2-3% of their total business this can be seen as negative news as TikTok is still one of their biggest vendors and still growing in the US (soon to be was). 

The 3⭐️ is for my conviction rating anything above 3 is worth the bet and any idea that falls below gets thrown in the 🗑️. Little late to be posting but I hope it helps ",2024-12-09,4,5

1feqk2z_ORCL,ORCL,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. It’s been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company’s cloud businesses. The stock didn’t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

“The excitement is back,” Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting “momentum across all business.”

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia — up 136% — among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracle’s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth — 18% in fiscal 2023 — and four times the company has contracted.

“After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,” JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. “We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.”

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company’s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsoft’s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he’d competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

“We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call.

Oracle didn’t immediately provide a comment for this story.

# ‘No more passwords’

For years, Ellison described Oracle’s database as “autonomous,” playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla’s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn’t need manual patching and wouldn’t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he’s benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon’s market-leading cloud with Oracle’s full-featured database.

“Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,” AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he’s now taking on passwords, which he calls “utterly ridiculous” because they’re insecure and can be “easily hacked.”

“This is the way log-on is going to work,” Ellison said on the earnings call. “I’m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ‘OK, Hi Larry.’ We’re done.”

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there’s no reason his computer shouldn’t be able to the same.

“No more passwords,” he said. “Those have got to go.”

Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected

Revenue: $13.31 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected

Oracle’s revenue increased 8% from $12.45 billion a year ago, according to a statement. Net income rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.42 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

At its after-hours price of about $153, Oracle is on pace to reach a record on Tuesday. The stock’s highest close to date was $145.03 in July. Prior to the report, Oracle was up about 34% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500′s 15% gain.

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 8 to 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Analysts were expecting growth of close to 9%, according to LSEG. The company sees adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 1.45 to $1.49. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.47 per share.

The company said its cloud services and license support business generated $10.52 billion in revenue. That was up 10% from a year earlier and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $10.47 billion.

Oracle’s cloud and on-premises license segment had $870 million in revenue, up 7%, and more than StreetAccount’s $757.6 billion consensus.

Revenue from cloud infrastructure came to $2.2 billion, up 45%. That is an acceleration from the prior quarter, during which revenue went up 42%.

“Demand continued to outstrip supply” of consumption-based cloud infrastructure, Catz said on the call.

During the quarter, Oracle announced the opening of a second cloud region in Saudi Arabia and said its database software will be available through Google’s public cloud.

In a separate statement on Monday, Oracle said it would partner with cloud infrastructure market leader Amazon Web Services to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.

Executives will issue guidance and discuss the results with analysts on a conference call starting at 5 p.m. ET.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $14.29 billion, vs. $14.55 billion expected

Oracle’s revenue increased 3% year over year during the quarter, which ended on May 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share, was down from $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The cloud services and license support segment generated $10.23 billion in revenue, up 9% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $10.29 billion.

The company’s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.84 billion in revenue. That’s down 15% and lower than the $2.09 billion StreetAccount consensus.

Cloud infrastructure revenue came to $2.0 billion, up 42%, which was a deceleration from the 49% growth rate in the prior quarter. The cloud business remains smaller than rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but is growing faster.

Oracle said in a statement on Tuesday that it would bring its database to Google’s cloud, with availability coming in November. In an additional statement, Oracle said OpenAI has selected the Oracle public cloud to extend Microsoft’s AI infrastructure.

During the quarter, Oracle said its database software would be available in five additional Microsoft Azure data center regions, bringing the total to 15. Oracle also announced generative artificial intelligence features coming to its Fusion cloud applications for supply chain and human resources.

Notwithstanding the after-hours move, Oracle stock has gained 18% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up about 13% over the same period.

The VIX at 12.30 sits at a multi-year (and pre-Covid) low. However, this week's vol and expectations for movement are a bit more than recent weeks as we see both a CPI report on Tuesday and an FOMC decision, and more importantly a Powell press conference on Wednesday. After the midweek data and fed speak we go into holiday/year-end mode where we see if stocks can finish the year on the highs or we see some profit-taking. Expectations for moves into year-end are narrow with SPX vol in the low teens. The expected move into year-end for the SPX is just 2%. Those looking to avoid selling stocks will find inexpensive hedges in the options market. Those looking to position bullishly into the new year will find the same to the upside. Jan vol in SPY is just 12 at the money, 13 in Feb and 14 in March. The highest IV in the near future is for this week.

Earnings highlights this week include Oracle on Monday, Adobe on Wednesday and Costco on Thursday.

For the quarter 5/31/2023, I have Oracle's total assets as 134,384,000 and their shareholder equity as 1,556,000.  So then the asset to equity ratio would be $86.36.  Isn't that very high?  Most other companies I looked at had something around $1-5.  What's the story there?  

Then in 2022, there was negative stockholder equity on the balance sheet.  How can that be a thing?  2021 had an asset to equity ratio of 22.02 and 2020 had one of 9.07.  I think I'm calculating it correctly, but what happened in the company history to cause that?

147sype_ORCL,ORCL,What you need to do for ORCL earnings tonight.,"Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.

J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to ""outperform from ""peer perform,"" citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.

ORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years. 

The Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.

ORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.

Accelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.

Oracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.

The strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.

It's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.

zj5q76_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ into Fed. Earnings from Oracle, Adobe and more.","## Market View

**Last Week – Some selling ahead of the Fed**

SPY fell 3.4% last week, a much larger move than options were pricing. The majority of the move lower happened on Monday and Tuesday and the market went sideways to close out the week. With the combination of the move lower and with the market now looking ahead to this week’s FOMC decision, implied volatility rose across the board. The VIX rose from 19 to nearly 23 and SPY IV for this week nearly 30. More on that IV anomaly below.

**This Week – Options are pricing movement this week**

SPY options are pricing a nearly 3% move for the upcoming week. About twice what options were pricing last week. The Fed rate announcement is this Wednesday of course, and option vol is high for this week relative to after. How high? SPY options this week are 29 IV compared to 21 IV for options expiring Dec 30th. QQQ vol is 34 for this week and 27 for Dec 30th. In other words, options are pricing the majority of the move for the balance of 2022 to happen this week. The expected move in QQQ this week is 3.4%, which is the majority of its expected move of 4.4% into year-end.

To illustrate the move for this week, an Iron Condor set at the expected move would be max gain if SPY closed the week between $382 and $405. That’s near where the latest rally stalled and well below recent lows of the past few weeks. Here’s how that looks on the chart:

yenmuk_ORCL,ORCL,Is META like ORCL?,"Disclaimer: I have $0 financial investment in either META or ORCL.

Some time back in '99 or '00, I was at a professional development conference listening to a keynote speaker. He was going on about how some day all sorts of devices would be connected to the internet - TV's, refrigerator, thermostat, home cameras, etc. And how his niche (ish) language named Java was going to run it all. The keynote speaker's name was Larry Ellison.

I clearly recall a conversation with other attendees where we joked about his ""internet of things"", who would really want everything in their home on the internet?!? We were all professional developers, full of knowledge and experience but lacking in vision. And here I am decades later coding software for IoT devices. 

Some people are capable of a long term vision that others can only laugh at, not see.

Is Zuck like Ellison here? Beats me - personally I think the whole metaverse idea, while great in movies like Ready Player One, will actually suck. Maybe it's an enormous black hole absorbing cash. But perhaps it's not.. what do I know, I thought IoT was stupid 20 years ago.",2022-10-27,10,53

**Last Week –** The SPY rallied 3.6% last week, more than making up for the prior week’s 3.1% decline. Options were only pricing a 2% move, so that’s several weeks in a row where options have been underpricing market moves.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** After 2 weeks near 26, the VIX declined to close last week, under 23.

## In the News

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we’ve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock’s volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here’s the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

**Last Week –** SPY closed on Friday down 1.5% on the week, inside the 2.2% move options were pricing. That move lower, even though it was inside what options were pricing was enough to drive implied volatility higher.

s3y3wn_ORCL,ORCL,ORCL has potential,"Just putting this on the radar since I really like the company:

Oracle is down ~16% from its December high. The reason for the decline is rooted in the M&A plan to acquire Cerner, an electronic health records company, in cash for $95.00/share (28.3b). 

This acquisition puts a premium on CERN at ~1.3b based on its current market cap of 26.97b (market cap maybe isn’t the best way to value a company, but for simplicity this works). CERN has a positive EPS of 1.70. The net income of the company in 2020 was 780m. By these numbers, ORCL will be in the green within 2 years of the acquisition (solid ROI) while positioning itself to evolve an already booming company in a high demand industry into a cloud based analytics engine. To be explicit: this acquisition is very likely a good thing for ORCL and they are making calculated, strong moves in my opinion.

The downward move in the stock price is a reflection of uncertainty but not of the fundamentals and potential for both of these companies. For this reason, I think ORCL is an awesome buy at the current price of $87.25/share.

I’ve recently purchased call options in ORCL and think the potential for big moves is present. As with any market prediction, I could be wrong. Thanks for reading.",2022-01-14,2,24

Profit taking is a trend that ORCL takes during every earnings period. This time it was exacerbated by the announcement they were acquiring Cerner on a all Cash deal.

Lets look at volume and stochastic indicators:

rkvqsm_ORCL,ORCL,Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Agrees to Buy Medical-Records Systems Provider Cerner Corp. (CERN) for $28.3 Billion All-Cash Deal,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-buy-cerner-28-3-151236475.html

(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. agreed to acquire medical-records systems provider Cerner Corp. for about $28.3 billion, a deal that would add a broad customer base in the health care industry to bolster the software maker’s cloud-computing and database businesses.


The all-cash transaction, Oracle’s biggest-ever deal, will see Oracle pay $95 a share, the companies announced Monday in a statement. The price represents a 20% premium over Cerner’s market value last Thursday, before the deal talks first became public. Oracle shares slid 4.3% at 1:40 p.m. Monday in New York, while Cerner shares gained less than 1% to $90.57.

Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said the acquisition should be “immediately accretive to Oracle’s earnings” on an adjusted basis in the first full fiscal year after closing and contribute “substantially more to earnings in the second fiscal year and thereafter.” The transaction is expected to close next year, the companies said.

Oracle, the second-biggest software maker by revenue, is best known for legacy database products. The company has struggled in recent years to gain ground in cloud computing, in which companies rent data storage and analytic power from large server centers, trailing far behind market leaders such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

The deal for Cerner gives Oracle a huge foothold in technology for the health care industry -- a sector expected to spend $15.8 billion on cloud infrastructure and software by 2023, according to market researcher IDC -- given Cerner’s robust user base, which includes many of the top U.S. hospital systems. And as Oracle moves more of Cerner’s systems onto its own cloud infrastructure, the company gains an important case study to help future sales.

“Data is where it’s at in health care. The ability to not just have a customer and an increased footprint, but to showcase Oracle’s database capabilities is a big thing for them,” said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at advisory firm Valoir.

Microsoft, too, sees the opportunity in health care. It announced in April that it would spend $19.6 billion for speech-recognition pioneer Nuance Communications Inc. to gain artificial-intelligence technology focused on helping doctors predict patients’ needs and upgrading hospitals’ digital record-keeping.

The challenge for Oracle is persuading Cerner customers, many that probably already run some Oracle products in their own corporate date centers, to make the jump to its modern, cloud-based applications on the promise that more tailored health care offerings will be available in the next few years.

“If I’m a hospital system and I’m trying to upgrade into something new, Oracle suddenly becomes a very interesting play,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anurag Rana. “You have a massive, large untapped market and if Oracle can create a good product out of it, you are going to start to attract more hospitals.”

David Feinberg, formerly vice president of Google Health, took over as Cerner’s chief executive officer on Oct. 1, saying a major goal would be to use data as a diagnostic tool to help doctors and nurses improve patient care. Two years ago, Cerner announced a deal with Amazon’s cloud division to develop programs trying to predict medical diagnoses or recommend courses of treatment for patients. It’s unclear how Oracle will navigate that challenge, given it would be a complicated undertaking to move systems that are now supported by AWS onto Oracle’s infrastructure.

Cerner’s choice of Feinberg as CEO highlighted the company’s move toward “a strategy based on big data, population health management and consumerism -- and away from the legacy health records business,” Donald Hooker, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said when Feinberg was named to the post in August.

Cerner, which competes with Epic Systems Corp. and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, among others, generated $5.51 billion in revenue during 2020, and sales are projected to rise by 5% to $5.8 billion this year. The company is based in North Kansas City, Missouri, has about 23,000 employees.

The acquisition is Oracle’s biggest since its 2016 purchase of NetSuite Inc., a deal valued at $8.7 billion. That purchase has provided Oracle with financial software targeted to small- and mid-sized businesses, which has become among Oracle’s fastest growing products.

Oracle had $22.8 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Nov. 30, according to its most recent quarterly earnings filing. The company said it doesn’t expect the Cerner acquisition to impact its investment grade credit rating.

After several years of stagnant revenue, the Austin, Texas-based company has produced six straight quarters of sales growth, sending its shares to a record high on Dec. 15 before the news of the talks with Cerner became public.",2021-12-20,23,8

Last Week – SPY was down about 1.7% last week, more than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.5% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $445 that corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$452** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was higher on the week and ended Friday at about 21, up from 16.50 to start last week. It is now higher than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 23, higher than last week.

The major ETFs are all pricing larger moves for this week than they did last week:

* SPY **1.5%**
* QQQ **1.6%**

The 1.5% expected move in the SPY is higher than the historical average.

nzcx0f_ORCL,ORCL,"3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Oracle, Adobe, Kroger","While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.

Although the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  

So far, stocks investors don’t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.

1. Oracle
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.

The shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant’s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.


Growth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world’s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm’s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.


2. Adobe Systems
Another stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.


Adobe’s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker’s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe’s revenue growth. 

In March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.

The company introduced a version of its popular app—Illustrator—for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.

Consumers of Document Cloud products—including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software—have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.

3. Kroger
Supermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.

Kroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer’s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.

Kroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers’ lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week’s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.

“COVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,” Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March.",2021-06-14,9,8

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$420** as a *bearish consensus* and **$429** as a *bullish consensus*.

Most of the meme stocks finished lower on the week. Options premium tends to spike when the stocks are squeezing higher and compress when the stocks have down days, or begin to go in either direction day to day. This is a dynamic traders should be watchful of when positioning directionally. It is not uncommon for out fo the money puts to lose money on down days in the stock, if vol is compressing.

At the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:

**QQQ 2.9%**  
**IWM 3.3%**

The VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.

**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:

[ULTA](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -3%, +6%, +0%

A note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.

The expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.",2021-03-07,445,129

jsyeii_TSLA,TSLA,Ergo Launches Oracle Solution for Cardano (ADA) to Foster Interoperability,"**Ergo (ERG) has announced the launch of an oracle solution for the** **Cardano (ADA)** **ecosystem. The firm claims its oracle pools present a new approach to oracles and make the creation of new types of** **dApps** **possible, according to a blog post on November 9, 2020.**

Ergo Deepens Partnership with Emurgo 

Last June, Emurgo, one of the firms in charge of the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, inked a strategic partnership deal with the Ergo Platform, in a bid to develop highly functional decentralized finance (DeFi) focused solutions. 

Now, it appears the alliance has started to yield the desired results for both parties as Ergo, a platform developed by former IOHK engineers, has unveiled an oracle solution for the Cardano blockchain. 

As stated in its blog post, the new oracle solution for Cardano is powered by Ergo’s extended UTXO model and will post data right from its (Ergo’s) oracle pools to the Cardano distributed ledger via what it calls tx metadata.

For the uninitiated, oracles are simply third-party services designed to relay information from the outside world to smart contracts. Ergo claims its oracles is already being used by one of Cardano’s stake pool operators, as it has numerous benefits over other models and they also allow for the creation of new types of decentralized applications (dApps).

Ergo wrote:

>**“One of Cardano’s oracles is utilizing data provided by Ergo’s oracle pools. Marek, a Cardano Stake Pool operator, has built a simple solution for Cardano. Information from the Ergo oracle is sent to the Cardano network through tx metadata.”**

What’s more, Ergo says its NUTS oracle currently serves six data streams, providing price information in real-time for ERG/USD: Coingecko, ADA/USD, ADA/EUR and the price of TSLA shares.

Promoting Interoperability

Ergo says the new oracles will lay a solid foundation for interoperability between Cardano and the Ergo blockchain, as both platforms now share the same source of data about the same digital assets.

Going forward, the team says it plans to extend the current functionality of its oracles and possibly create complex DeFi solutions such as Ergo-Cardano atomic swaps, with cross-chain liquidity pools and pricing decided by mutually-agreed oracle data.

Cardano remains one of the most active blockchain projects currently in existence. As reported by *BTCManager* on October 8, 2020, the Cardano Foundation released details of its delegation methodology for interested stake pools operators.",2020-11-12,29,0

“I have given the deal my blessing -- if they get it done that’s great, if they don’t that’s okay too,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn before departing for North Carolina . “I approved the deal in concept.”

Trump said the new company will likely be incorporated in Texas. 

Oracle, Walmart and Tiktok could not be immediately reached for comment. 

The outcome could boost Oracle’s position as a company that can handle challenging computing workloads and help to resolve a geopolitical dispute between the U.S. and China.

TikTok and Oracle [both said Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/oracle-confirms-deal-with-tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-become-trusted-technology-provider.html) that ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, had sent a proposal to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend. Reports throughout the week said that negotiations were bogged down on the precise details of the deal, including the ownership stakes of Oracle and ByteDance, and control of the recommendation algorithms TikTok uses to promote particular material. 

Oracle CEO Safra Catz was a member of President Trump’s transition team, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison threw a fundraising event for Trump earlier this year.

Oracle already provides cloud infrastructure to online video services [8x8](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=EGHT) and [Zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=ZM), among other clients, although [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN), Microsoft and other companies picked up more cloud revenue than Oracle in 2019, according to [estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019) from industry research company [Gartner](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=IT).

[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) had sought to acquire TikTok’s operations in the U.S. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) as a partner, but on Sunday said [ByteDance had decided not to do that deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/microsoft-bid-for-tiktoks-us-operations-rejected-by-bytedance.html).

China and the Trump administration have used tariffs in their trade war in recent years, and their disagreements have spilled over into the technology industry. The Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States [pushed for a sale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/grindrs-chinese-owner-says-to-sell-social-media-app-for-608-million.html) of dating app Grindr by the Chinese company that bought it in 2016, and the committee later [looked into ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/mnuchin-confirms-tiktok-is-under-cfius-review.html) of Musical.ly, a video sharing app that ByteDance merged with TikTok in 2018, because of national security concerns. A Trump executive order in August in August sought to [block U.S. transactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/trump-issues-executive-orders-to-ban-us-transactions-with-wechat-tiktok.html) with ByteDance, as well as [Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=700-HK), which owns messaging app WeChat.

President Trump had taken steps to [ban TikTok in the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/trump-says-he-will-ban-tiktok-through-executive-action-as-soon-as-saturday.html) or make ByteDance [sell the app’s U.S. assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/president-trump-orders-bytedance-to-divest-from-its-us-tiktok-business-within-90-days.html). The Chinese government subsequently revised export restrictions so that they now cover “recommendation of personalized information services based on data analysis,” among other things.

iso7dg_ORCL,ORCL,Oracle wins race to bottom to acquire TikTok US Operations as “trusted partner”,"Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.

Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.

The next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok’s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.

“We will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,” Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. “From our standpoint, we’ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, that the phones are secure and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.”

Mr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.

The Treasury secretary said he wouldn’t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.

The move by TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.

The structure of Oracle’s deal wasn’t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.

Two people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn’t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance’s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.

The possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer.

Microsoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.

“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.”

DOES ORACLE’S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?

A look at the state of play for the video app’s ownership and the prospects for a deal.

In a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing “discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.”

While China’s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok’s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app’s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn’t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.

Oracle’s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft’s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn’t have much insight into now.

The New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.

TikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.

Oracle wasn’t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand.",2020-09-14,76,32

Oracle Corp. ORCL -0.58% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, a person familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.65% in a deal to salvage a social-media service that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.

Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the person said.

Microsoft earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.

We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”

The move by Beijing-based ByteDance comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company by Sept. 15, though it isn’t clear if that is the operative deadline. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer. That gives the parties until Sept. 20 to seal a deal.

TikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.

The Trump administration has pushed for a sale, expressing concern that TikTok could pass on data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China’s authoritarian government. TikTok has said it hasn’t been asked to share data with the Chinese government and wouldn’t do so if asked.

Beyond my chimpish analysis of general market factors, the valuation looks stretched with no upside. With 8% discount rate and similar cost of equity, the current valuation assumes a constant long term 4% free cash flow growth, while the trend suggests closer to 2% - and that's assuming pretty aggressive revenue growth of 4-5%, which they haven't achieved once in the last 5 years. 

The only upside here might be benefits from reduced corporate rate and repatriation of cash effects.

The company has enough resources to develop and acquire new technologies. Well, guys, who want to buy?

5zh4tw_ORCL,ORCL,$ORCL Earnings 3/15/17 - A Historical Perspective,"**In classical antiquity, an oracle was a person considered to provide wise and insightful counsel. As such, I feel a strong personal connection to the company $ORCL. The $ORCL brand, much like BigChiefMason, is forever tied to ideas of prophecy, precognition, and increasing stock price following earnings.** 

Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was founded 39 years ago in Santa Clara, California, USA. That's right, $ORCL is a formidable representative in the landscape of technology, asserting American financial dominance on the world stage. Serving enterprise software and computing services, $ORCL is at the forefront of border control and protection. Through automation, $ORCL is ensuring the sanctity of American healthcare by removing low paying jobs typically allocated to illegal immigrant leeches. With two CEOs, $ORCL is twice the company its competitors, such as $GOOGL, $YHOO, or $AMZN aspire to be. With such incredible assets $ORCL is set to rise following good earnings and OK guidance. 

**TLDR; $ORCL stock price precedes its name.**

2ziknr_ORCL,ORCL,(ORCL) Options (Non-Linear?),"Hi, I've been investing in options for a few months now and I came across a problem today. I'm not able to understand what's happening. Context:

I bought ORCL Call options @44.50$ for 0.63$ ea. on Friday the 13th. At the time ORCL was trading at 41.54$

Oracle Corp. released its fiscal third-quarter earnings report on the 17th. The stock went up 1.66% AMC and was ranging between 2.30% and 4.5% on the 18th. I knew this would happen, however, Options were doing the exact opposite.

Check: https://cldup.com/PjdpSnyMkh.png

ORCL Call options @44.50$ went from 0.63$ to 0.35$.. How is that possible? In my mind, when a stock goes up the Options are going up too (it's linear). It's quite surprising since Calls and Puts went down..

Do you guys have any tips to avoid events like that ?

Thanks!

nlq4d_ORCL,ORCL,Why I bought some ORCL today,"Obviously some hedgies drove the truck this morning and dumped a whole bunch of ORCL on the market. I picked up a positon this morning. Why? Because I think it's a solid company at a great price. This 14% off the stock price from yesterday's close means I'm getting it at less than 14 trailing P/E. Then there is a small dividend that put a cherry on this cake.

For all the craze about NoSQL databases they are just not the solution for a great majority of problems where a relational database is a must. Additionally for all the hate that Java receives from angry teens on /r/programming it is the lingua franca of enterprise programming and Larry now has full control. They are already monetizing it by starting to charge for server JVM deployments. I don't think the market appreciates just yet how much power Larry got by getting hold of Java.

Could blow up in my face in the future? Perhaps. But from my perspective this was a seasonal sale on a pretty nice stock.
