1km3kmw_OXY,OXY,Buffett's $OXY: What's the simple value logic?,"Hello fellow r/valueinvesting members,


I'm seeking your expertise for feedback on the following analysis. I don't necessarily intend to purchase the stock, but I'm trying to understand the rationale behind Berkshire Hathaway's decision to invest in it. It's become a bit of an obsession for me.


I am aware of their preferred stock holdings, but this analysis focuses on their investment in common stock.


While a common explanation is, ""We like OXY position in the Permian Basin"", as a value investor, I find this explanation too simplistic. Buffett and Munger are not known for speculation; they favor solid investments supported by clear financial metrics.


Therefore, there must be a deeper reason for this investment, and I suspect the answer is simpler than we might imagine.


The first red flag is that oil is a commodity, and oil companies' earnings are heavily dependent on oil prices, which are inherently speculative. This doesn't seem like a typical Buffett investment.


Now, for the analysis, I've attempted to keep the approach as straightforward as possible. The simplest logic I've arrived at is as follows:


Firstly, it's prudent not to assume that oil companies will possess more oil than their proven net reserves; assuming otherwise would be speculative.


Occidental Petroleum (OXY) acquired CrownRock for $12 billion. CrownRock's net proven reserves are 623 million barrels of oil equivalent. At the time of the acquisition, the oil price was approximately $70 per barrel. This would value CrownRock's reserves at roughly $43.61 billion (623 million barrels * $70/barrel), representing the gross expected future revenue. This implies a multiple of approximately 3.634 on the acquisition value ($43.61 billion / $12 billion).


As of today, OXY holds approximately 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. During the period of Buffett's common stock acquisitions, the oil price was also around $70 per barrel. This would value OXY's total reserves at $322 billion (4.6 billion barrels * $70/barrel) in terms of gross expected future revenue. If we apply the same multiple used for the CrownRock acquisition (3.634), we arrive at a valuation for OXY of approximately $88.60 billion ($322 billion / 3.634).


During Buffett's acquisition period, OXY's market capitalization was around $60 billion. If this valuation method is sound, it could suggest that Buffett was acquiring the company with a margin of safety of roughly 32.3% (($88.60 billion - $60 billion) / $88.60 billion). And if this kind of valuation is right, based on OXY's current market capitalization of $43.6 billion, it would mean that today it has a margin of safety of approximately 50.8% (($88.60 billion - $43.6 billion) / $88.60 billion).


This is the simplest approach I've identified that aligns this investment with value investing principles, but I remain uncertain about its validity.


Other valuation methods are very challenging and unreliable. Predicting the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) for oil companies is nearly impossible, as it's tantamount to predicting oil prices. Even when attempting a valuation based on historical figures, I haven't found clear evidence of undervaluation.


Two other possibilities come to mind:

 * They possess information that is not available to the general public.

 * They were primarily impressed by the company's management and placed less emphasis on strict valuation metrics. (I find this hypothesis difficult to accept).

 *  This video suggests Buffett's focus is on OXY's strong cash flow for buybacks and dividends, viewing it as a ""coupon clipping bet"" on existing assets rather than speculative drilling, similar to his Chevron investment and comparing it to US Treasuries for yield with limited risk.   However, I am not really convinced that what is being said is true and would like an opinion on the video: https://youtu.be/9tXj16MoQbQ?si=B1ScGMkSpnew6_gJ


What are your thoughts? Could you share your perspective or any knowledge on this subject? I would appreciate an objective reply or some supporting numbers.

1juoczb_OXY,OXY,Oxy stock future,"Guys the unexpected has happened, many of you here I have seen have held bag on oxy at 50 levels. The assumption was that crude oil prices would hover around 70 and then go higher up but today the wti crude oil futures crashed below 60 as u well know coz of the tariff fiasco of trump and expected recession. Now if u have read the investor report of oxy, the effect on free cash flow for 1 dollar decrease in oil barrel price is around 260 million so that would mean , given today's 59 futures price a 11 dollar decrease from the avg crude oil price of 70 for FY 2024-25 which gives us 11*26 = 2.86 million dollar less free cashflow and yes if they go to 50 dollar a barrel it's done. 2024-25 FCF was
4 billion, so that gives us 1 billion FCF for this year if oil futures hang around 58 and now that opec has started to increase their production along with a recession sentiment we can see worse times.

Now coming to the share price, people have touted that oxy is undervalued but I always thought it was fairly valued at 60 dollars a share which was the case when the company had 70 dollar a barrel cost. Now I actually didn't do much calculation and just bought shares of oxy at 38.9 dollars a share today which I saw go down 7 percent the same day and I sat and did the calculation. If oil goes back to 70 dollars we can see the stock back at 55 range. Now how much time will it take is the question , coz will trump trigger a recession which obviously we can't predict but surely for the near term the increased opec production has signalled worse prices for oil coz the Saudis can afford to have more barrels at lesser price as long as it is just a tad lower than their current income. The stock is now at 36 dollars a share, and assuming it takes 2 years time( a non conservative estimate) for oil to get back to 70's range or more as demand comes back high after a recession, oxy would be back to 60 giving us a return of 54 percent (over my buying price of 38.95). 

But there's a catch, oxy has a lot of debt which it said it intends on decreasing with assumptions of that constant 70 s oil barrel range thesis. Now those will be halted and complete dividend slashes will happen and that can be pretty bad as the outlook wouldn't be so good for oxy given that position. But again there's a catch ,it might very well be that this whole decrease in barrel price (which are just futures) doesnt hold up and oil increases to 65 dollars a barrel (that would mean we would do fantastic on the investment) if things change due to  trump holding back and assuming that we don't enter into a recession but we will have oversupply over the short term though with opec increasing production giving us depressed prices. 


So my overall judgement is that oxy right now is an okay bet at these prices, the risks are there But the reward seems to be juicy as well. What are ur thoughts on this folks ? I am just an Indian software guy working in Bangalore and I am pretty new to investing so my thesis can have a lot of holes in it and therefore would like you guys to comment on this.

1i9nm6c_V,V,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but reducing in carbon emissions doesn't quickly eliminate all the carbon in the atomosphere. To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.

*That is a fact.*

There are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.

However, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.

*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*

And unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.

*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.

*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.

*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* 

What baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Nvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:

(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.

(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.

(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

1i9nm6c_AMD,AMD,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

1i9nm6c_META,META,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but reducing in carbon emissions doesn't quickly eliminate all the carbon in the atomosphere. To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.

*That is a fact.*

There are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.

However, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.

*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*

And unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.

*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.

*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.

*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* 

What baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Nvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:

(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.

(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.

(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

From,

YetAnotherSpeculator

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but reducing in carbon emissions doesn't quickly eliminate all the carbon in the atomosphere. To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.

*That is a fact.*

There are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.

However, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.

*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*

And unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.

*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.

*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.

*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* 

What baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Nvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:

(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.

(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.

(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

From,

YetAnotherSpeculator

**\[Amendment; January 27, 2025\]** Please re-read my stance on tech. In a mere 2 years AI investment, we are at a crossroads with Nvidia v.s. DeepSeek. I believe this letter speaks for itself. As for what's going to happen?  I have no fucking clue, but I do not believe natural market forces are in play.

**\[Amendment; April 9, 2025\]** In an ironic turn of events, an orange man is shilling EVs and about to tank US shale. So much for ""Drill, baby drill."" Now, I have no doubt that lower oil prices equals less oil production. **But, if US shale falters, there will be massive ramifications**. There is a reason why the stock market is declining rapidly. There is an old man fondling economic nukes, putting the world on the brink of economic instability we have not seen since the pandemic. The fear is real, and opportunity is already appearing. Perhaps there's a reason why Berkshire was making small bets on beer, pizza, and pools... in any event, depending on how long these tarriffs persist, US shale is one of the last places you want to be...

**\[Amendment; May 14, 2025\]** As Warren Buffett said himself, this market volatility is nothing. Had you seen my revisions, I swung massive handsomely into a small oil company in the state of California and let’s just say have done quite well since during this recovery. As for where i put those gains, OXY is neither on nor off the table, but other opportunities can and will exist. oil is a commodity and volatile, but it works in both directions. but one thing won’t change and that’s how important OXY is to reducing the deficit…",2025-01-25,210,83
1i9nm6c_NET,NET,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago.

Climate activists' be damned, but reducing in carbon emissions doesn't quickly eliminate all the carbon in the atomosphere. To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.

*That is a fact.*

There are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.

However, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.

*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*

And unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.

*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.

*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.

*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* 

What baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Nvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:

(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.

(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.

(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

**\[Amendment; January 27, 2025\]** Please re-read my stance on tech. In a mere 2 years AI investment, we are at a crossroads with Nvidia v.s. DeepSeek. I believe this letter speaks for itself. As for what's going to happen?  I have no fucking clue, but I do not believe natural market forces are in play.

**\[Amendment; April 9, 2025\]** In an ironic turn of events, an orange man is shilling EVs and about to tank US shale. So much for ""Drill, baby drill."" Now, I have no doubt that lower oil prices equals less oil production. **But, if US shale falters, there will be massive ramifications**. There is a reason why the stock market is declining rapidly. There is an old man fondling economic nukes, putting the world on the brink of economic instability we have not seen since the pandemic. The fear is real, and opportunity is already appearing. Perhaps there's a reason why Berkshire was making small bets on beer, pizza, and pools... in any event, depending on how long these tarriffs persist, US shale is one of the last places you want to be...

**\[Amendment; May 14, 2025\]** As Warren Buffett said himself, this market volatility is nothing. Had you seen my revisions, I swung massive handsomely into a small oil company in the state of California and let’s just say have done quite well since during this recovery. As for where i put those gains, OXY is neither on nor off the table, but other opportunities can and will exist. oil is a commodity and volatile, but it works in both directions. but one thing won’t change and that’s how important OXY is to reducing the deficit…",2025-01-25,210,83
1i9nm6c_OXY,OXY,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

Major recent external factors:  
Donald Trump has recently argued that increasing U.S. oil production could help lower global oil prices. He has suggested that ramping up domestic drilling, reducing environmental regulations, and promoting fossil fuel use would boost supply and put downward pressure on prices.

While reduced oil prices could mean a lower profitability for the company, the way to obtain this through increased productivity could mean public investment is in sight, the creation of new opportunities through new deals with Europe, likely trying to substitute Russia's stake.

The outcome is likely unpredictable and dependable on the approach taken by the US presidency (subject to different interpretation).

1fd6c04_NVDA,NVDA,The best play of the year after NVDA : OXY petroleum ,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is currently trading near its 52 week low.  OXY is driven in large part by the broader softness in oil prices. Historically, the stock price of OXY has been highly correlated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and it appears the company is undervalued in relation to both its assets and potential future earnings.

Over the past two years, every time the price of oil has approached $65 per barrel on the WTI Crude oil , it has marked a significant bottom for both crude oil prices and OXY's stock price. Given the cyclical nature of the oil market and the company's strong fundamentals, OXY's current valuation represents an attractive entry point, with considerable upside potential as the oil market stabilizes and eventually recovers.


Historically, OXY has seen strong price recoveries whenever oil prices have tested this level multiple times, and each time, prices rebounded as demand fundamentals improved or geopolitical factors led to tightening supply.

Currently, oil prices are once again nearing this critical $65 level, which suggests that the downside risk for OXY may be limited. With global demand for oil still robust, and supply potentially constrained by geopolitical tensions or production cuts from OPEC, there is a reasonable expectation that oil prices will stabilize or rise in the medium term. This would provide a tailwind for Occidental's stock price, as the company benefits directly from higher oil prices through increased revenues and profitability.

**OXY is Undervalued**

In terms of valuation, OXY is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that is below its historical average and lower than many of its peers in the energy sector. This undervaluation is evident when comparing the company’s market capitalization to its assets and earnings potential. Occidental’s massive oil and gas reserves, along with its investments in sustainable energy technologies, make it one of the better-positioned companies to weather fluctuations in the energy market.

Moreover, Occidental has significantly improved its financial position in recent years. The company’s aggressive debt reduction program has strengthened its balance sheet, making it less vulnerable to swings in oil prices. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway remains a major shareholder in OXY, having increased its stake in the company over the past two years. This signals strong institutional confidence in Occidental's long-term prospects, adding credibility to the view that the stock is currently

Occidental is not just about oil production; it is about hedging against tech stock that are overvalued right now

To summarize :

Occidental Petroleum is trading near its 52-week low, largely driven by oil price weakness. With oil approaching the $65 per barrel mark, historically a bottom for both crude prices and OXY stock, the current situation presents an opportunity for long-term investors. Given its undervaluation relative to earnings potential, strong balance sheet, and strategic positioning in both traditional oil production and sustainable energy technologies, OXY represents a strong buy at its current levels. The company’s operational resilience, coupled with the likelihood of oil price recovery, provides significant upside potential for investors looking for value in the energy sector.

Iran is going to have to do something fairly big in response in an attempt to keep Israel in check. Resulting instability, escalation, and Russian interest in causing regional chaos could send oil stocks up as shipping through the Straight of Hormuz could be complicated by Iran if there is broad escalation. Defense stocks could also pump. HES MRO and OXY look like more attractive plays rn given recent price action. And of course, if things escalate quickly, spy/qqq puts should continue to print. NFA

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Longer version (may edit later to add more sources)

Things are escalating the Mid East. Israel responded to a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed a bunch of kids at a soccer game by assassinating 2 guys. The guy who launched the rockets in Beirut (alone prolly nbd) and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas political chief (bfd). Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital. Assassinating foreign leaders openly is a big deal. Doing it in rival nations capitals is a bigger deal. And what it means is that Iran is now in a position where they *have* to respond.

Israel needed to thread the needle with their response to Hezbollah to hit the off-ramp. Hardliners were not going to allow a response that was too mild with the awful nature of what happened in the Golan Heights. But international actors were desperately trying to prevent a response that went too far so as to avoid broader conflagration.

International diplomacy failed and Israel went too far. They assassinated the leader of an organization that didn't do the attack in the capital of a foreign rival.

The US is moving military assets to the ME now to protect Israel from a likely Iranian response. Although Iran's response to one of their Generals being killed in April didn't do much damage, they are in a realpolitik position of having to punish Israel for this, lest they grant carte blanche authority for Israel to start decapitating leadership of rival political groups throughout the region with impunity. This is an extraordinary action that Iran cannot afford to rubber stamp with inaction.

Iran and its allied proxies run the distinct risk of escalating conflict in the region by being *too soft* in their response.

The final kicker here and the elephant in the room is Russia, Iran's closest and most powerful ally. Russia has an extraordinary set of incentives for Trump to beat Harris in November, the most obvious being complicating US funding for Ukrainian defense (there's a whole lot more there but that's one of the most immediate benefits for Russia).

With Harris taking over for Biden's doomed effort, the political calculus has shifted for Putin. A broader regional war in the ME is bad for an incumbent presidency by itself. That causing already teetering markets to collapse further is also terrible for Harris. And on top of that, [gas prices ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Wohar/publication/24076097_Do_increases_in_petroleum_product_prices_put_the_incumbent_party_at_risk_in_US_presidential_elections/links/54f467fb0cf24eb8794e6abf/Do-increases-in-petroleum-product-prices-put-the-incumbent-party-at-risk-in-US-presidential-elections.pdf)have a lot of influence on election cycles.

Russia may believe that a middle east war will produce a Trump victory and that otherwise, those odds are growing longer by the day. With markets on the ropes, Russia may believe prompting an large Iranian response now could be a tipping point.

And if Iran believes that they cannot afford a weak response, their best means of reprisal would be having their proxies attack Israel so the Houti's in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and what's left of Hamas in Gaza.

How to play it:

HES, OXY, MRO - The Straight of Hormuz is the concern. If Iran wants, they can shut it down or at a minimum make passage very difficult. That means oil companies with less production in the ME have the most to gain. After 10/7 when there was a perceived risk that Iran would complicate the straight, all 3 of these jumped over the week following. Plus the options are pretty cheap. Depending on how this is developing Monday, I'll probably buy some MRO $28c 8/23 (currently about .55). I don't trade a lot of oil stocks so any feedback welcome on these companies. One other upside is that they all appear to be oversold currently.

EDIT: Its true that these three don't move very fast but the premiums reflect that. Needless to say, its certainly not a play you want to make very far OTM if at all, imo. Commentor [La\_Menace\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/La_Menace_/) also pointed out the risk that if the gains for these companies are modest, economic chaos may swallow any gains they make because of Hormuz stuff. For me, the premiums are cheap enough that it could be a reasonable lotto play but certainly to each their own on this.

EDIT: [CultureForsaken3762](https://www.reddit.com/user/CultureForsaken3762/) Says XOP is the play, more correlation with oil prices. Ty

LMT, RTX, defense etfs - appears as though these companies have been on a run but they could go further if things escalate. Again, any input on these/defense stocks that could run is welcome, don't typically trade them.

DRS too? Comment below reads:

""Solid DD but missing DRS when talking about defense stocks in this region shows you could’ve gone deeper. It will fly in the near future"". Certainly worth a look ty!

ZIM - someone mentioned this the other day and it did go up at the Golan attack. However, look at its chart after 10/7 before you make the call on that, it actually went down (iirc) a few days after.

Index Puts - I mean who doesn't have these right now?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Just gonna put a couple other notes about things down here but you don't need to read this part unless you hate yourself and your spare time.

1. De-escalation scenario - the window is narrower than post-golan imo. The reason is because doing very little to nothing effectual in response is now by itself a cause for escalation because it invites more assassinations and attack by Israel. Plus with Russia potentially wanting war, there is no voice in the room for Iran that is discouraging attacks. I'm having trouble seeing an Iranian response that delivers a pound of flesh
2. Nuclear things - I don't see a strong risk of a nuclear response any time in the near future but if tensions escalate and international actors get drawn-in, the more likely nuclear thing that could escalate things is declaration by either Iran or Israel. Iran cause they finished thier first bomb. Israel could abandon long-standing nuclear opacity as a flex.
3. The Tehran assassination - as details emerge, it could influence the response. If it was just a drone through a window, that's one thing. But if some of these reports that Iranian security helped plant the bomb and it was there for month are true, it means Iran needs to be a lot more worried because they are compromised af.
4. Already escalating - been checking in on the news as I write this. Israel is stepping up attacks on South Lebanon, they blew up a school today, they killed another vip in the West Bank today, Yemen may have just taken a shot at a ship from the UK.
5. Biden may have lost his ability to influence Bibi- it seemed to me like the assassination of the commanding officer that launched the Golan missiles was a smart off-ramp attack. I wouldn't be surprised if that killing was negotiated through backchannel (Hez might have even given him up thinking it would avoid an escalation). But it seems like Biden had no idea Israel was planning to pop the Hamas political chief in Tehran. If that's the case, it means Israel is giving in to hardliners internally and shutting-out the 'cooler heads'.  Even worse they may be faking willingness to agree to a truce to buy more time. Article about that:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/assassination-again-shows-netanyahus-disregard-for-us-israel-relations)

6. Hope I'm wrong about things escalating, there's enough dead kids in Gaza already, I'm by no means rooting for Israel to open-up on Lebanon. But I think given recent events, its worth keeping an eye on.

EDIT/UPDATE: This is looking quite bad. The Biden Admin has no control over what Netanyahu is doing now. They can't stop them and its become evident that Bibi has been bullshitting Biden about the cease fire in Gaza. Bibi fired Gallant, a bad sign when things are taking a turn for the crazy aggressive (e.g. assassinating foreign leaders). 

Reports are coming out that Iran could attack [within the next 48 hours](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/iran-hezbollah-attack-israel-monday-blinken). No way to know if that's true. Could also just be Israel hyping the threat to make the case for preemption.

Israeli sources are reporting that Israel could [preemptively strike Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-could-preemptively-strike-iran-if-intelligence-shows-attack-is-imminent-report/) if they felt an attack was imminent. What's interesting and worrisome about those reports is that they seem more like Israel priming the narrative for why preemption was the only option. They're setting a low bar for ""knowing the attack is imminent"" as its pretty widely recognized that Iran plans to attack somehow.

Finally, the reason why escalation might be right around the corner is that most parties involved now want it and benefit from it. Putin because war, economic recession (at least correction), and sky-high gas prices are a good formula for getting Trump elected. Iran because their hardliners are losing their minds because of the assassination. And finally Netanyahu also has an inventive to go to war now because he too would want to influence the US election. He's proactively been making the Biden admin look like shit on this one and he knows that a massive war in the ME is going to devastate Harris' chances in November. He'd rather have trump in office so he knows he can continue with this wild-west style war mongering and the US won't stop him, not even a little. Harris, on the other hand, is faced with a catch-22 if war escalates: Condition or withdraw support for Israel in the conflict and suffer the wrath of AIPAC before the election. Or support the war and lose the youth/progressive vote because Harris is the veep who's signing-off on selling bombs to a country that will kill kids with them.

**So if you accept my awful napkin math, you're paying $72.91B for $45B worth of oil, plus $28B for OxyChem (which will generate $1B/year in pre-tax income).**

It seems slightly rich, but not awful. I mean, a P/E of \~30 for OxyChem seems high but not crazy when you look at [comps](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/predefined/sec-ind_ind-largest-equities_specialty-chemicals/) in the chemical industry.

**Update June 22, 2024**

So I've changed the approach to attempt to get to an intrinsic value per share for *just* the Oil & Gas business. I now accounted for the fact that OXY owns only half of Western Midstream *and* I treated the $8.5B face value of the preferred stock as debt. The table now looks like this:

|**Value per Share excluding OxyChem**|**48.77**||**49.58**|

So, post acquisition, Oxy Petroleum is worth roughly $50/share . OxyChem, again, generated $1B/year of pre-tax income, so if you value it at 20x pre-tax income you get an intrinsic value per share of OXY as a whole of around $70B. Please keep the comments and corrections coming.",2024-06-18,8,13

16ltslv_OXY,OXY,Occidental Petroleum and the future of fuels,"TLDR: OXY will have a trillion dollar market cap  20x  it’s current value.

OXY is my largest holding, with a market cap of  58 Billion, it is massively undervalued. This is my investment thesis and I am interested if anyone else has concluded the same.

What they have:  Using chatgpt, assuming an equal distribution of oil in the Permian Basin, the values of their holdings is over 250 billion dollars. This alone is multiples over the existing market cap, but no where near it’s potential.

What they are building: 

Stay with me….

A few years ago Berkshire Hathaway purchased Pilot Flying J, the largest network of interstate diesel pumps in the US. Bill Gates exited the board of Berkshire. Then over the last 2 years Berkshire has built a 25% position in OXY. 

Early this year Gates himself visited Joe Manchin to lobby (successfully)  for Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Buried in it is a unique 45q direct pay tax credit. Essentially the companies that sequester CO2 will be paid directly from the IRS $180 per ton, for 12 years. After it’s passage, OXY immediately began construction of the worlds largest DAC project. Capable of sequestering one million tons per year. Then the DOE granted a billion dollars in grant funding for carbon capture. OXY received half. They turned around immediately and purchase Gate’s Carbon Engineering. 

But the planned DAC facilities are not for sequestration in the long run.  Rather, and this is my theory, they are using gov funds to subsidize the build out of Global e-fuel production network. This is why Berkshire has taken such large positions in OXY and Pilot. Cars will go electric, truck will stay diesel, but it will be produced from the air, not pulled from the ground. And Occidental Petroleum will dominate selling a “green” drop in solution for truckers worldwide. 

OXY will have a trillion dollar market cap  20x it’s current value.

# Transaction Selection

1. All Open Market Transactions from May 15th - May 19th. These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Both indirect and direct transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from May 8th - May 12th.
4. No companies without a ticker
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as backfill which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is \*roughly\* 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings. That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included \*if\* the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data was pulled by the algorithms behind Form Fore

13e0e52_OXY,OXY,Occidental Petroleum Redeems 6.5% of Preferred Stock Held by Berkshire Hathaway: the mechanics of this redemption,"Occidental Petroleum Corp. (Occidental: OXY) redeemed a small portion (6.47%) of its preferred Series A stock held by Berkshire Hathaway (BH) during the first quarter of 2023. Some of the details are hazy if you read the financial press like Yahoo Finance and Motley Fool. So I’ll explain the mechanics of the redemption that actually took place.  
  
Berkshire owned 100,000 shares of Occidental's 8% preferred stock with a face value of $100,000 each: that was as of year-end 2022. So the total value held by BH was 100k x $100k = $10 billion. Easy enough. Occidental has a mandatory redemption program with this preferred stock governed by provisions regarding dividends and stock repurchases. For example, if Occidental spends more than $4.00 per share in either (i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share has to be redeemed with a 10% premium. This is for the preceding twelve months, i.e., the last twelve month (LTM) period.  
  
So let's go through these numbers. Occidental paid out 57¢ in common dividends in the LTM period. Remember, Occidental recently increased its quarterly dividend by 38.5% from 13¢ to 18¢. That just happened in March 2023. So 13¢ x 3 + 18¢ = 57¢. How much LTM repurchases were there? Per 10-K, Occidental spent \~$3.0 billion on common stock repurchases during calendar year 2022; in Q1 2023, it spent \~$700 million; in Q1 2022, the amount was $36.6 million. These numbers are rounded so we can't arrive at the exact number -- but it's around $3.7 billion for the LTM ending March 31, 2023.  
  
Divide $3.7 billion by the weighted average common shares outstanding over the period. Again, the rounding makes things inexact: but that’s around $4.14 per share. Add to this the dividends per share of 57¢ = $4.71. Occidental has to mandatorily redeem anything above $4.00. So there is your 71¢. But how does 71¢ translate to the amount that has to be redeemed? Multiply by the weighted average shares outstanding, which I estimate to be around 908 million: $0.71 x 908 million = $645 million; this is close enough to the $646.8 million that Occidental is redeeming (the Preferred Stock Agreement between Occidental and BH has exact provisions on how these numbers are calculated for the redemption).  
  
BH also received a 10% premium above the redemption amount. So $647 million x 10% = $64.7 million. That’s the total cash outflow to BH for this redemption: $647 + $64.7 = $711.7 million. This is why on page 4 of Occidental’s 10-Q, you see $712 million as “Preferred stock redemption payable”: this is a current liability item due to BH to be settled by Occidental within 12 months.  
  
Remember, GAAP follows accrual, not cash, accounting. Page 21 of the 10-Q says, “Of the $712 million mandatory redemptions accrued as of March 31, 2023, $551 million of preferred stock redemptions, inclusive of a 10% premium, were settled in cash subsequent to March 31, 2023 but before the date of this filing.” Therefore, Occidental bought some time and paid $551 million of the $712 million between April 1st and May 9th of 2023.  
  
So how does $646.8 million in redemption translate to BH’s ownership of the preferred? Remember, there were 100,000 preferred shares with $100k in face value. The redeemed amount ($646.8 million) divided by $100k is 6,468 preferred shares. Therefore, the remaining shares owned by BH is 100k – 6,468 = 93,532, as shown on page 21 of the 10-Q.  
  
Let’s try to interpret the larger implication of this redemption. Barron’s, for example, claims that Occidental has begun to “rid itself of a high-cost source of financing” which Carl Icahn compared to “taking candy from a baby.” Well, that was back in 2019 prior to the start of COVID-19, when the average Fed Fund Rate (FFR) was around 2.16% for the year. Now the FFR is around 5%. Occidental’s credit rating is Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch; it’s considered high yield by two of the three rating agencies. The long-term Baa yield is around 5.5%; the high yield rate for bond funds with majority BB components is as high as 7.5% to 8.5%. The proper yield for Occidental’s long-term debt would be something in between: it would probably be 6% to 7%. Plus Occidental gets tax deductibility from its debt, unlike the preferred dividends distributed with after-tax earnings.  
  
So yes, it does make sense to redeem a portion of the eligible preferred stock but it was mandatory anyway. BH still holds 93.5% of the preferred shares (93,532). If the dividends and share repurchases stay at the same rate, Occidental could redeem the entire preferred stock in 16 quarters or 4 years. But with the likely recession in the offing and lower oil prices affecting dividends and share repurchases, the redemption of the preferred could get drawn out and BH could end up holding the preferred for many more years.",2023-05-10,32,4

139zqb1_OXY,OXY,Rip speculative Oxy calls and potentially share price on Monday,"So during Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder's meeting Buffett was asked about Berkshire's position in CVX/OXY. And his response was that OXY was a good company and they will continue to hold and may or may not add more to their position. However, they are not looking to buy control of the company. They're content with their current position and will see what to do in the future. So if any people like myself invested in OXY hoping for a potential buyout by Buffett. Those hopes have been dashed. I mean to be fair it was expected, but since he kept increasing his holdings all the way to 23.6% seemed quite speculative.

124yjnx_OXY,OXY,Berkshire May Be Trying to Acquire OXY After All: Harks Back to the $44 Billion Purchase of BNSF Railway in 2010,"BH bought additional 3.7 million shares of OXY on March 23 and 27, bringing its total to 212 million or 23.5% of the total common shares outstanding.  He bought them at a weighed average price of $58.89, which is lower than the exercise price of some 84 million warrants he holds on the common stock -- the warrant exercise price is $59. 624. Upon finding out about the transaction, Cowen upgraded OXY and the stock is now trading in the money at $61.79.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-occidental-petroleum-130001164.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-occidental-petroleum-130001164.html)

So what do you think BH is trying to do here? Buy the company outright through these incremental purchases? CNBC's commentators mentioned that's what Buffett may be trying to do -- this is what he did with BNSF Railway, which he bought in February 2010 after a series of purchases that topped out at 22.6% and assuming its debt. The price BH paid for BNSF Railway was $44 billion, the largest transaction in BH history.

But this could end up being larger: what these news outlets don't understand is those 84 million warrant shares already entitle BH to a 33% stake in OXY; it's not just the 23.5% he holds now after last week's transactions.  BH can exercise the warrants when he disposes of his preferred shares and they are now in the money (BH already has the legal right to buy up to 50% of Occidental’s shares). So it would seem that this is a set up for the outright purchase of OXY, which may become part of the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit.  After assuming $27b of OXY debt, BH may have to pay $40b plus for the remaining 67% of OXY: the total deal could be well over $70 billion or almost twice the size of BNSF Railway.

Btw, when BH tries to buy the remaining 67% of OXY, he would have to pay some premium, so it's likely to be higher than what it's trading at right now, since BH would acquire control and pay for the synergy and control premiums.  BH may be trying to deploy some of that excess cash it's been sitting on all these years.  If there aren't good enough investments to make for its portfolio, just buy the whole company and bring it under the BH umbrella.",2023-03-28,117,16

However, today I just noticed that the stock has come closer to Buffett's latest purchase price of $61.

So, I started doing more research on the stock and what I found interesting is that $OXY has big plans to develop carbon capturing side of the business. 

Carbon capturing is basically you capture CO2 from the atmosphere and store it underground. It is sort of a middle ground as it gives us more time before we move to more greener options in future.

$OXY has plans to go big on this and their first plant becomes operational by 2024.
Just to put things in perspective all the Ev'# of the world reduce CO2 emissions by transportation by 4%. Oxy's first plant will capture CO2 emissions close to 7.8% of all the emissions by transportation. And by 2035 they plan to have 100 of these.

However, there are rumors of Warren Buffet wanting to acquire the whole company. Squeeze out limits in the US are low (>50%), so that makes it highly likely that he swallows it. Both holding on to it and selling for a favorable price is good for me. I just want to understand what I am up against.

So when is generally a good time to sell with an impending acquisition? What are the risks for waiting until a tender offer is made, what are the risks of not taking the offer? What are possible opportunity costs for selling now?

Are there risks in being a small minority stakeholder when BRK controls the majority? Are there specific thresholds I have to watch?",2022-08-22,51,72

wopy33_OXY,OXY,"Offset 28k of realized losses by selling Oil (XOM, OXY, EPD) or keep for dividends?","Debating in my taxable brokerage account if I should sell my oil stocks that I picked up during pandemic lows to offset 28k of realized losses mostly from stupid decisions on low quality growth stocks and Netflix.

Even though my biggest position is TSLA, I don't think oil is going anywhere for 10+ years so I'm not opposed to holding but I really don't want to keep writing down $3000 of capital losses for the next 10 years. Ideally my plan is to offset 25k of losses and then use the remaining $3000 against my W2 income. If I can figure out the perfect split  of 15k in short term losses and 12k in long term, that would be even better too.

XOM seems like a sell to lock in 14k of gains but would lose out on an almost 10% yield on cost and 861$/yr in dividends.

OXY is a harder one because my cost basis for 250 shares is 11$. On the last earnings call, CEO said it's very likely that OXY will pay 4$/share in 2023. That's almost 40% YoC. I have the option to exercise 200 shares at 27$ which would be \~14% YoC. Or I could sell it all and take 20k of gains tax free losing out on 1800$/yr in dividends.

EPD I hate the PTP taxes so I want to sell this regardless.

2. Taking longs over $66 with targets of $67.3 and even $70 down the road.
3. Stops come with a 1h close below $64.2 as that will likely fill the gap to $63.15.

wk52po_OXY,OXY,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway now owns over 20% in Occidental Petroleum," More shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp were purchased by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, surpassing the 20 percent ownership required to record a portion of the oil company's earnings alongside its own and potentially generating billions of dollars in profit.

***6.7 million Occidental shares were purchased by Berkshire for around $391 million between August 4 and August 8 according to a regulatory filing made on Monday night. With the acquisitions, Berkshire now owns 188.4 million Occidental shares, or 20.2% of the reported shares outstanding, for a total market value of $11.3 billion.***

With a 20% ownership, Berkshire would be able to use the so-called equity method of accounting to report its proportionate part of Houston-based Occidental's earnings together with operating results. However, Berkshire may argue that because its ownership in Occidental is passive, its accounting for the company should not alter.

Refinitiv I/B/E/S estimates that analysts anticipate Occidental to earn $10.5 billion in profit this year. Of addition, Buffett's company holds warrants to purchase an additional 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion, as well as $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock, which was used to help finance the 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.

According to some analysts, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire may eventually make a bid for the entirety of Occidental. An inquiry for comment made outside of market hours was not immediately answered by Occidental or Buffett's assistant.

In the first half of this year, Berkshire had an operating profit of $16.3 billion. For the food firm Kraft Heinz Co, in which it has a 26.6 percent share, and the operator of truck stops Pilot Travel Centers, in which its 38.6 percent investment is anticipated to reach 80 percent next year, it applies the equity method of accounting.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is currently up 5%. This comes after the news that Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has increased its stake in OXY to more than 20%.

However in my opinion, carbon is slowly fading away. For example EU has a law that will ban all fuel based cars in 2040.


OXY had negative net income in 2019 and 2020.

Oil, gas and energy companies are some of the best-performing stocks over the past few months, with some at our near all-time highs. Many top the high RSI (overbought) lists after seeing multi-year lows during the pandemic. For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100.

Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either. There are a lot of moving parts for these stocks right now, the war in Ukraine, a potential recession to name a few., but as volatility has visited both the broader stock market and the oil and gas markets, these stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have ”crashed higher” towards all-time highs without seeing corresponding increases in their own option implied volatility. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge, as put spreads for any reverse in oil prices are cheap (relative to oil itself) on the single name company side of things.

Every single piece of data you can find on the topic makes it very clear we are running toward the edge of a cliff. IMO the only way through the inevitable supply crisis is some sort of gas stimulus, at the moment the average American consumes 500 gallons of gas a year and [average price has gone up from 3.27](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-costs-hundreds-more-for-average-american/) to [4.56](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) in 6 months. Average salary is 50k, so that is 1.3% of people's money, at some point people will start demanding wages to go up which is going to make wage/price spiral worse. In a way, it's going to make sense to subsidize gas to stop energy from contributing to wage/price spiral. But even if it didn't make sense, it's an election year and politicians are going to want an excuse to give shit away

And I mean we're already seeing [different forms of gas stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/us/gas-tax-cuts.html), it's not gonna help supply but sure [why not make it rain](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/04/29/2022-gas-stimulus-checks/9585306002/?gnt-cfr=1)

Normal supply/demand dictates that if u have a fixed supply and increasing demand, price goes up until demand destruction. Oh gee I wonder what's gonna happen to price if governments are gonna do everything they can to avoid demand destruction by subsidizing it.

OXY's last earnings 1.5B on 60B market cap. That's god damn 10 p/e. Look up any oilco and you'll see the same shit. Hella profits. Look at oil futures for any date to 2027. The entire curve is lifting every day.

Also Warren Buffet sat on a massive cash horde thru the mega bull run of 2020, and he is literally [yolo'ing the top of this chart](https://www.reuters.com/business/berkshire-buys-more-occidental-shares-boosts-stake-152-2022-05-05/)

Introduction:

Hello everyone, some of you may have seen my post last week about Coinbase and since that turned out well for myself, I figured fuck it, why not do another smooth-brained, crayon munching investment thesis. This is not financial advice either, I am a broke 21 year old college kid who eats crayons and sniffs glue in my past time. This week is a much more boring thesis over “Occidental Petroleum Corporation”, they are a company that deals in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. In the following sections, I hope to provide you all with something of substance over why you should, or should not take an options position with OXY. 

Reason One (Bullish):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dcskxpx02zx81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=21883d9d3bde74ee6a888427e72c5ee2f1da6f60

Above is a simple five-year chart of OXY’s share price. The reason I wanted to show this is simply because I would not be comfortable opening a bullish options position on an oil and natural gas stock at its all time high. Luckily this five year chart strokes my confirmation bias right where it hits different. This is the weakest of my points by far but it makes me feel better knowing it traded near $90 a share in July 2018. Additionally, I am not worried about upside potential because the prolonged depression of share price was largely due to COVID. 

Reason 2 (Bullish):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mwjdz1562zx81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1bf5f75eb0518573005027d878979a228fc030

Our boy Warren Buffett just increased his stake within OXY significantly. They bought another 5.9 million shares of OXY boosting their stake to roughly 15.2%. He made these purchases on May 2nd and May 3rd. In total, Berkshire owns 142.3 million shares worth 8.8 billion dollars and additionally has another 10 billion of preferred stock they received in 2019 after helping to finance OXY’s purchase of “Anadarko Petroleum Corp.” Finally, Berkshire also has warrants to buy an additional 5 billion dollars of OXY shares at a discount.

Reason 3 (Bullish):

Above is a one year chart for WTI Crude oil. As anyone with eyeballs can see, crude oil has been on quite the absolute price pump this last year. This should continue to bode well for OXY’s share price especially in the short term as the low supply of crude oil weighs on the price per barrel. In my opinion, despite oil futures falling slightly this past week, in the short term (now to June-July) OXY should not have significant downside risk due to a falling price of oil. This is because quite simply I do not see such a fall in price happening. Despite what I feel like is an incoming global recession that will lessen demand for oil, I still believe demand will be robust enough to maintain current price levels for crude oil. As concise as I can be, things such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, President Biden’s Administration refusing to renew leases on public land for an increase in oil production, the Keystone pipeline still rolling in its grave, and China finally easing up on the lockdowns they imposed on major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing will all contribute to a decreasing supply of crude oil and an increasing demand for crude oil.

Reason 4 (Bullish):

Earnings are on 5/10/22 after market close.

Above is a picture of OXY’s earnings the last four quarters as well as what is expected going forward. Although past performance is not necessarily a perfect indicator for future performance to say the least, I think it is incredible that OXY has beaten estimates for four consecutive earnings calls at this point.

For those of you with big brains who like things quantified, here are the exact numbers that ought to quell the anxiety felt when you are listening to some random degenerate on the internet drone on.

The above picture shows EPS is in a clear uptrend, indicative of a company not only healthy financially, but thriving, likely to see continued growth.

For those of you who would like to see the annual financials, here they are. Some things to note that I personally see as positive indicators moving forward, is most notably operating income. It came in at “$4,208,000” for EOY 2021 and had its second best OI of the last four years. Additionally, “non-recurring expenses” were virtually eliminated for 2021 which to me signals better financial management by the company and is likely to continue as this is a clear break from previous years with significantly higher “non-recurring expenses”.

Currently, OXY has a PEG ratio of 0.21.

“As a general rule, a PEG ratio of 1.0 or lower suggests a stock is fairly priced or even undervalued. A PEG ratio above 1.0 suggests a stock is overvalued. In other words, investors who rely on the PEG ratio look for stocks that have a P/E ratio equal to or less than the company’s expected growth rate”

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/oxy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/oxy)

Where I could be wrong:

1. OXY does not have an attractive PE ratio which could suggest it being overvalued. Industry average for “Oil/Gas production” is 27.73, and OXY has a PE ratio of 39.50.

Source: [https://eqvista.com/price-to-earnings-pe-ratios-by-industry/](https://eqvista.com/price-to-earnings-pe-ratios-by-industry/)

1. Anything that increases the current supply occurs. More supply and less demand would not exactly bode well for an oil and gas stock. For example, the Biden Administration renews leases for Oil and Gas companies on public lands suddenly. The Russia - Ukraine war ends or exports begin to be accepted again from Russia. 
2. Anything that decreases demand occurs. China goes and locks things down again decreasing demand for oil and natural gas. Consumer discretionary income decreases and as a result Americans travel less. 
3. Earnings doesn’t go well.
4. Captain Money Printer decides to do a 75 basis point (or greater) rate hike at the June FOMC meeting. 

Conclusion:

For the reasons above I am bullish on OXY for the next few months. As a result I will be opening at least one call option at market open on Monday, May 9th.

TL;DR

Oil and natural gas are still having robust demand with continued supply issues that could widen the gap between demand and supply. Buffett has a rather large stake in OXY that he just increased this past week. Finally, their financials are robust to say the least, and they have beaten earnings expectations each of the last four quarters.

podh1h_OXY,OXY,Thoughts on investing in energy & inflation through OXY/WS?,"I’ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 shutdown *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra dollars to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

I think it is the best stock in Energy Sector currently.

&#x200B;

STOCK TICKER: OXY

Current Price: $20.38

Short Volume: Around 60%

OXY has been an easy target for short sellers for more than a year.

OXY was so undervalued due to Energy sector, and 3.8 B loss in 3rd quarter.

1. OXY is one of top 3 shale oil company in US. It was expected to be TOP 1 or TOP 2 in 2020 if there was no COVID-19. With a high priced merger in 2019, OXY tanked all in 2020.

**P/E raito is still -1.28** which is crazy as other Energy companies (CVX -13.95, BP -3.58, TOT -19.14, PSX -11,76, RDS A -8.9)

OXY's position : **break even is $35** for crude oil price (current crude Oil price $52.77) WHY is OXY Shorted STILL???

**OXY makes $17.77/ each Barrel (34%)**

According to Merill, at **$47 WTI, unlevered free cash will be $4.1 BN** which will exceed 3rd quarter loss.

We are expecting huge surprise on earning.

2. To use Biden’s green Energy, Crude oil price has to be above $75 (42%higher than the current price) which is currently (**$52.77**). Green Energy companies were peaked when Crude oil price was over $100 in 2007\~2008. And, due to Russia event, the crude oil price will jump soon or later. Russia was the one who opposed Oil production cut down but they are busy with politics in the homeland. (Hope for the best)

3. Many Energy companies including OXY, they are changing carbon free production which will benefit them financially and investing on Green Energy sector.

4.  **short volume (60%)**, Why does individual investors have to suffer from firms' short positions?

5. The Legend, **Carl Icahn**, is still on OXY. He is heavily invested in OXY position. (It will be his return from failure of HERTZ (which short sellers put it down))",2021-01-27,2,130

kmabt0_OXY,OXY,OXY Warrants,"First time considering warrant options, is my below understanding/calculations correct please, I have a long time horizon so the 2027 expiration year is no problem for me:

OXY warrants (expiration date 03Aug2027) appears to be a good opportunity.

Strike price- $22.00

Current Premium- $6.65

ITM- $28.66

Current common share price- $17.40

Hypothetical $500 investment now would get you 28.7 common shares or 75.1 warrants

Option #1- wait until 2027 expiration and if ITM ($28.66) I would make approx $1655 (minus premium), this represents an annual ROI of approx 20%

Option #2- i could sell the warrants any date before 2027 and make a small profit.

A 20% annualized ROI over 7 years is pretty good for my risk level, of course I could lose all the premium ($500) if warrant is not ITM before expiration date.  I think the risk is worth it as OXY appears to be recovering and aggressively reducing their debt levels.

Is the above calculations/though process correct before I pull the trigger, of course it's my own personal opinion, I would appreciate any other good less risky warrants to stagger before 7 years to create a ""warrant ladder"" similar to a CD ladder as an option to my current equity holdings, thank you",2020-12-29,1,3

# Short or Long Setups

**$PLUG**

Massive multiday rip with a spinning top candle 11/12. Could signal a reversal, and see a nice dump below LOD. Could also catch shorts sleeping and squeeze above HOD. Either play I'd be scalping and taking most profits off the table pretty quickly. As with all names, don't anticipate, wait for key levels break.

**$PTON**

Gap down with some tailing dojis on a bounce. Today we closed just over 50D SMA. If this holds and we break 11/12 HOD, could see nice move into gap fill territory. If we break back below 50D SMA, there's not much room before 11/12 LOD, and no support until 99.83. Nice pockets on both sides.

(Also I don't know why IB told me the day before and told me it was 1:8 spin off I was under the assumption something with warrants was going to happen on July 6th).

&nbsp;

I have 1 Short Call at the $19 strike that is now OXY2 and 100 shares. According to the memo in the OCC I was entitled to 12 Oxy warrants as I can see in my position summary.

&nbsp;

To my understanding these warrants do not yet have a strike price nor an expiration determined yet? I saw on the OCC 47244 and 47250 memo it was regarded as the $22 strikes and I read elsewhere on some random blog it was supposed to be on July 6th for Date of Record and August 2020 for Delivery of the warrants.

&nbsp;

IB told me this would not affect my buying power but this is an unusual spin off. I'm a little afraid of holding it in its entirety because I'm not familiar with warrants and I plan on selling half as soon as they determine a strike, price, and time. I do not plan on exercising them assuming their at a $22 strike since I would reasonable assume value in them alone if they were to even get close to the strike would be more worth my while. Would this be a poor assessment and plan?",2020-07-03,0,3

hffjpm_OXY,OXY,(OXY) Occidental Petroleum outlook discussion,Hi I am interested in how you all view OXY in the short and long term. I have an average stock price of $15.77 thought about taking profits at around $24 but decided not to -- current price $18.00. It has 78% institutional ownership which in my opinion should indicate that they believe in the company. Even had one analyst rating for target price recently increased to $33.00. They also just put a bidding date of July 1st for the land they are trying to sell in Wyoming. Recent attempts at selling assets haven't been successful and I can only find information on one potential buyer the Governor of Wyoming it says they have received interest from several other entities. They are seeking up to 700 million from the sale of this asset but will this even make a dent in their current debt of upwards of 40 billion dollars? In the last two weeks or so I have lost $6 of value on my shares so regardless I'm staying long at this point.,2020-06-25,15,41

g34fbq_OXY,OXY,DD - OXY in trouble,"Occidental Petroleum has been in trouble since buying Anadarko for $57bn.

The board structured the purchase specifically to avoid a shareholders vote. This required an outside financier (Warren Buffet) to loan OXY the billions necessary for the purchase. He wrote himself a hell of a deal which the board agreed to - 8% premium dividends, payable by cash or equity.

The bill is coming due for OXY, and they are so strapped for cash with oil crashing that they're paying Buffet back by issuing new shares, diluting the value of existing holders. OXY is also paying a premium for paying his dividend in shares rather than cash [Barrons](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/occidental-petroleum-would-pay-a-bonus-if-dividend-payments-to-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-are-in-stock-51586179749)

Revised: ~~Buffet has signaled he may sell the shares off.~~ poor source. 

OXY still has several billion dollars in bonds outstanding and coming due this summer and near zero cash flow. The equity values are dependent on oil being $50/barrel. The risks on puts are acquisition (unlikely when the other major players are also hurting) or government subsidies, which are unlikely as congress is in recess and the House will be obstinate after Trump bypassed the oversight in the first bailout.

If oil stays below the $20 mark, I see OXY going to $5 by end of May.

Disclaimer - I have put open through August on OXY for the above reasons.
