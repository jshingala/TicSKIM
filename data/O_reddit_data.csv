1kn9beh_O,O,General question about reinvesting and RealtyIncome(O) in particular,"Just wondering here.

As I guess, plenty of people are into reinvesting their dividends. And companies usually have a great reporting on that, knowing exactly how many dividends are reinvested and they can forecast how many will be reinvested in the next period.

Let's make it specific and take a given REIT as an example - RealtyIncome knows, that 89% (or some other percent) will automatically reinvest their dividends the second they receive them and a certain percent of investors will be doing that 12 times a year.

Thus, there will be a huge buying of a stock on a given 15th day of the month. Then will that increase the price of that stock somehow? Just to make a few millions more for the company?

Is this a ""thing""? If not - why?

1kk281o_JPM,JPM,26 y/o considering dividend ETFs vs growth - hear me out,"I’m 26 and I know the usual advice: “Go for growth when you’re young, pivot to dividends later.” But honestly, that doesn’t sit right with me right now given how overextended the market feels.

Quick background:
At 22, I had $160K in Tesla (got lucky early), sold it, and made a terrible move into a company that eventually went bankrupt. I lost everything. That experience left me a little scarred when it comes to chasing growth without discipline.

After college, I started at $55K/year, then jumped to $104K, and now I’m at $125K (all-in). Funny thing is—even though my income more than doubled, my savings rate exploded from $5K/year to $40K+. That’s when I realized: income growth can multiply savings if you don’t inflate your lifestyle.

Now, I’m contributing ~$600/week into a brokerage account, and I’ve been seriously leaning toward stable dividend ETFs like SCHD, JEPI, and JEPQ. Why? Every time I look at growth ETFs, the top holdings just seem… too expensive. I can’t justify paying current prices for stretched multiples, especially when my gut is telling me we’re in an inflated environment.

My thought is this: I want my excess savings to increase my income, not just sit in volatile assets that I don’t believe in right now. When growth looks more attractive or when valuations make sense, I’ll pivot. But for now, I want to stay invested without fighting my instincts.

Would love to hear how others are approaching this—anyone else feeling the same tension between traditional advice and current market reality?",2025-05-11,27,46

1kdiwgc_O,O,O’Reilly stock is over priced.,"Stores are cutting hours so management will get their bonuses and keep stock  holders happy. It’s BS.

The stores are cutting hours of drivers and the Pro customers are getting tired of waiting 3 hours for a part they have in stock. 

Store managers are quitting because they are working too many hours and they are unhappy with their new compensation scales. 

Once they stop opening stores with OPM, they will need to perform and grow with a finite number of stores. Tariffs will hurt the company as well since car parts are made over seas except the high end high performance items which is an extremely low percentage of sales. Calipers, rotors which is their specialty are all made in foreign countries. 

The split may help if approved. 15 to 1 will make the stock appear affordable. However, the problem I see is there will be less room for error. If a recession occurs, then people will fix what they have and business with remain flat. But, the weekend car wash family will not be buying quality car shampoos and wax if mom and dad got laid off. 

What worries me the most is the cutting of hours if the hourly employees. They do not make a lot of money. Also, the drivers and counter people are the faces the customers know. They know your name, where you work and what project car you are working on.

1kctkm3_F,F,Is a Washington-based day trading LLC subject to B&O tax on gross receipts?,"I'm trying to clarify Washington State B&O tax rules as they apply to a day trading LLC (with S-Corp election and mark-to-market accounting).

1. Is it correct that Washington State exempts day trading income from B&O tax, even if it's earned through a trading business?
2. Does the Department of Revenue consider day trading to be ""service and other activities"" subject to the 1.5% (or 1.25%) B&O tax rate on gross receipts?
3. Does the answer change if the LLC elects mark-to-market under IRS Section 475(f)?
4. What about city-level B&O taxes (e.g., Seattle)? Do those apply even if the state doesn't tax it?

Any clarity on how trading income is treated at both the state and city level for tax purposes would be appreciated.

That LLC didn't create any gains to pay the tax on, it has losses and the gross receipts number(trade volume) is big. That would spell a disaster. r/TaxQuestions , r/Daytrading",2025-05-02,1,0

1jv3wsf_PG,PG,Kevin O'Leary is calling for 400% Tarrifs on China... Is it smart move or a very bad one?,"https://preview.redd.it/yw5fi02guste1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf657de24849b4befed15ea99e6c11c54dc59f1d

Kevin O’Leary is calling for 400% tariffs on China to “put them in their place.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Wonderful himself is sitting pretty with a net worth over $400 million, completely insulated from the fallout regular people might face — like higher inflation, supply chain shocks, and global tension.

Easy to talk tough from a throne, but what about the rest of us?

Is this actually a smart economic move, or just reckless chest-thumping with real consequences?

What do you think — is this the kind of pressure the U.S. needs to apply to stay on top, or will this backfire badly for both economies?

And honestly, should someone like Mr. Wonderful even have a say in these kinds of geopolitical issues?

He’s a businessman with a huge personal net worth, driven by profit motives — not necessarily by what's best for workers, inflation, or everyday Americans.

Is this smart policy advice... or just financial tough talk from someone who won’t feel the consequences?

Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko emphasized the need for in-person discussions to ensure the agreement aligns with Ukraine's strategic interests. The U.S. views access to Ukraine's mineral wealth as strategic, aiming to secure raw materials crucial for military and industrial purposes while reducing reliance on Chinese-dominated supply chains. ​",2025-04-09,297,4

So, what’s the long term game for Realty Income? We all know retail real estate ain’t what it used to be and it's kinda going the same way as office real estate.

Question is, does Realty Income have a solid plan to stay on top or is it just another REIT that was once great but is now on its way out?

Does it have any plans to turn into a diversified REIT maybe, and significantly increase their exposure to in-trend sectors such as industrials, logistics & data centers?",2025-03-26,101,75

I use Vanguard for set it and forget it index funds and IBRK for slightly more active trading - nothing too risky - no options tradings, no day trading, all long positions on individual stocks. I occasionally use indicators like RSI and MACD to time my investments into stocks that I was already planning to buy. 

My current portfolio looks like this: 40% VTI (Total U.S. Stock Market), 30% VEA (International Developed Market), 10% VWO (International Emerging Market), 10% BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway), 10% Mixed Bag of Individual Stocks. 

I thought about making it simpler by just doing VTI and VEA. As I near retirement age I plan to gradually increase my bond allocation but right now having any bonds at all seems detrimental. If I had a higher  risk appetite and a more positive outlook on the big tech stocks right now, I might replace VTI for VOO as it has better historical performance (not an indicator of future gains, blah blah...) but I really am concerned by how concentrated the S&P 500 is.

p.s. there's nothing special about Vanguard ETFs. I just find that they typically have competitive expense ratios and like the idea of having all/most of my index funds from one brokerage. I think Fidelity and Schwab are great options too. I've also heard good things about M1 Finance but they seem a little experimental so I just stick with Vanguard and IBKR. 

Here are some of the stocks in the mixed bag, 10% allocation, traded on IBKR: TRI, SSP, SCHL, CHGG, LMND, TQQQ, UTHR, WAB, PGR, JPM.

I have a credit score of 799 and have never missed a payment (thanks Mom for letting me be an authorized user on your credit card). Three cards make up that score (Chase Freedom Flex, Some Random Discover Card and a STEP Card). I have considered looking into a money market account at Chase so that my savings/emergency fund can earn a little more but don't fully understand it enough atm to pull the trigger. 

I have been super fortunate to have been supported financially by my parents. Up until this point I have had decent transportation to and from school/work, plenty of food on the table, quality electronics and resources for studying, gaming and programming (not to mention clothes and a roof over my head). Most of the money I have now came from working at a local credit union over the summer and fall of last year along with saving all the money I got from things like Christmas and Birthday. I also worked for my Dad every once in a while as a kid and he would sometimes pay me depending on the work (bringing him tools for his construction/repair/contracting/renewable energy business). My largest asset is the Macbook I'm typing this on (I'm a reluctant mac user :p). Neither of my parents are fabulously wealthy and they don't plan to contribute anything to my college education (I'm hoping I might be able to live at home during some transition periods so I don't have to drain my savings on a rent deposit when I haven't figured out my employment situation or things like that). Oh, and also I have  no debt (woop woop!).

On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my finances? How fortunate is the situation I am in in terms of privilege and do you have any advice for how to contextualize all of the privilege I have been given. There is certainly some bad shit that I have intentionally left out of here but I am curious from a purely financial standpoint where I stand in terms of what percentile of people have it as good as I do at 18 and what part of that is due to making informed decisions or being given parental support. 

Are there any problems with the individual stocks that I chose or should I have a more concrete/outlined strategy in that section - perhaps swapping out larger companies like JPM, for more small cap stocks to even out the large caps that tend to be in low-expense ratio ETFs like VTI?

As an update I currently own 152.73 shares of $O with avg cost of $54.1 per share, and still my current position is up 6.2%.

I also sold a CC with $57.5 strike and Mar-21 expiration date - if $O is above that I will probably let my 100 shares go and wait for the next opportunity.

But once again, $O is a great investment if done right, it is not just a monthly divvy, but rather think of monthly dividends as a nice treat while you are waiting for the recovery. 

And lastly, If you had a chance to buy $O at $52 and you didn't, well, that's a pretty good opportunity missed right there!",2025-02-24,125,44

I’m looking at the 10-year chart and it basically acts like a bond, trading between $50 and $80 for the most part. 

I’ll admit I own it (not a lot), I get that it pays a monthly dividend and it’s a way to diversify into REITs. I guess that’s enough right there. Currently a 5.8% yield, but there are bond ETF’s that pay more than 5.8% that are much more stable.

1hgpgi0_NET,NET,Another Realty Income ($O) appreciation post,"But with a different flavor. I know this is dividends sub, and I also only see $O as a metric for a monthly income, and it all comes down to the number of shares that I hold.

But for exact same reason I also see it as a great instrument to trade, and by trade I mean just a handful of transactions each year, to grow the magic number of shares as much as possible. If you can sell shares today and buy back $1 cheaper tomorrow that's almost 4 months dividend right there.

I only trade/hold it in my Roth account, which for personal reasons is relatively small, I started very late in my life and deposited my first $3000 in 2022, then added another $3500 in 2023. 

I closed 2023 with \~108 shares of $O, worth of $6400, which I actually all sold on Jan-8, just to buy something else that later resulted in losing $200, but as $O dropped to $54 I bought back my shares again with 4 extra shares, totaling 112 for February. As $O continued to drop, with the little cash I had left from prev transactions I bought 2 more shares at $51 each.   
  
So my total number of shares by end of March was close to 115. In July I sold other positions and added $O at $57, to a total 133 shares. A week later I sold a Covered Call expiring in September with $60 strike for $84, which is equivalent of 3 months worth of dividends from a 100 shares. $O did grow that much and even past that, so I got my 100 shares called away. I still kept remaining 33 shares and as $O price fell I bought 103 shares under $57. 

I sold all my shares before ex-dividend date in November at $58.45, as I saw the risk of $O falling further down, which has now happened and as of this morning I own 150 shares bought at (premarket) $54.36:

https://preview.redd.it/s496v5q85i7e1.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad68ad282794f1c07b4f1f7a17cb82c2dd0c7c09

Anything can happen at this point. I am currently planning to hold for sometime, as I don't expect $O to go back to $65 anytime soon, so if it stays in lower 50s I would be happy with natural DRIP growth at lower prices. If I see it rise to $57 soon I might sell another CC with $60 strike to collect premium.

Just thought this might be interesting for someone. I know everyone looks at $O as a cash cow, but if you do it right there is some growth as well, just need to know your levels.",2024-12-18,36,36

1grmtgd_O,O,20 y/o looking to start investing during internship ,"Hi, 

I will be doing internship as a junior in college where I should be able to save 4k / month, right now I have a brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I opened to start investing when I start getting paid. I was thinking of maxing out my IRA with more aggressive LETFs like QLD and only investing in VOO in my brokerage since I will be investing much more in my brokerage so I want to take less risk whereas my IRA from what I read at my age it would be better to be more aggressive since the potential returns are much higher and it would be tax free. 

I was also wondering if I should be some money in a regular savings account as well that would be easier to take out if needed (I’m fortunate enough to have my parents behind me in case of an emergency so not sure if I need a savings account). 

 Looking for advice on what I think of investing in, also would it be smart to not invest everything at once and keep some to continue investing next year in case the market goes down so I can lower my average price since I won’t be making any money until summer 2026 after this one.

1gl5q0x_PATH,PATH,24 Y/O considering options trading full time,"Afternoon, I am a 24 year student who is doubled majored in accounting and finance, finishing up my last semester of college. I have had some great success in trading options over the years while in school, but as my schedule became more demanding I eventually had to give up trading  to focus on my degrees. I am 100% sure that I have the ability to trade full time. Recently I opened a paper account to make sure I'm still consistently profitable and responsible enough to make rational decisions while applying some of the knowledge I've learned in school. I know that going full time on stock options is a substantial risk for my future. Not having a full time job or reliable retirement plan,  all while your income depends on whether you're making good decisions and managing risk effectively. However I feel as if this has been my calling for several years. I was wondering if any true full time derivatives traders could give me some insight on how to prepare to make this transition from a full time job, and about some of the unexpected risks and hardships of this career path. I am mainly concerned about how much cash I need to be trading with to be able to pay all of my bills (I have expensive hobbies, like traveling, and producing music) while growing my account to set myself up for a peaceful future. I plan on living below my means as soon as I graduate and start full time at either Dell or Charles Schwab and I have no debt.  All of my spare cash is going to go straight into my options account and I will continue to grow it until its time to quit my job, but I don't when to quit.

Despite concerns around potential deregulation under a future Trump presidency, I believe the market’s reaction is an overreaction. 

These companies are strategically positioned for consistent growth and income, and the risks are likely being overstated. Long-term fundamentals remain strong, making this a good opportunity.

1g78rz3_O,O,What do we think of this tariff discussion between Cuban and O’Leary?,"Recently on CNN, O’Leary was on there arguing tariffs on China should be 400%. The reason being that they steal his IP, make the same molds he uses for products and then ship them here under a different brand at a lower retail price. The idea of the 400% tariffs are to bring the leader of China to the table to negotiate some more fair standard of business. 

Then Cuban had given his take on X basically saying that a higher tariff would cause them to knock off his products even more suggesting that the legal products would be subject to tariffs but the illegal knock offs wouldn’t be. He then explains That a knock off sells for 25% less than branded versions and 60% tariff on a lower priced knock off is less than an American company paying on their high priced, branded product. Also that this knock off problem could never be solved via negotiations as those markets will find a way to persist anyways. 

I’m not sure either one is 100% right. I can’t imagine what a 400% tariff would do to markets, although markets seemed to perform just fine last time Trump implemented them. They have really done exceptionally well considering all the risks factors markets had to overcome the last 3 years. So in a sense I suppose even if its not about knock offs, would tariffs benefit the economy over the long haul? The idea always was that companies would have incentive to make products domestically, which in turns provides more jobs etc. 

What do we think about how this would affect markets/the economy if 400% ever came to pass? ",2024-10-19,0,30

I am wondering if I should keep both and slowly build them up or sell O and put it into JEPQ.

1e5vr2i_O,O,31 y/o just getting started. Questions regarding my employer 401k,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for the long post. I’ve been slowly teaching myself about investing so I’m fairly new.

I’m 31 years old and unfortunately just getting started on my employer 401k and investing. I would like to be a bit aggressive since I have absolutely nothing saved anywhere but just opened a Roth IRA through Fidelity and put $200 in it for now invested in FXAIX.

As for my employer 401k, they have a pre tax and Roth contributions option. They will match up to 6% in total. Right now I have 6% on pretax and nothing for Roth contributions. I don’t make much so I need to take home as much as I can since I rent and have a child.

My questions are;

1.	⁠what is a good amount to contribute to each pretax and Roth? Should I focus on one more than the other? Ignore one completely?
2.	⁠What should my asset allocation be and in which investment? I don’t want to be in bonds just yet so I’m picking my own investments. TDFs don’t seem right for me.

They offer FXAIX or JDEUX for large cap, since I’m familiar with Fidelity I figured FXAIX is best. Should I just stay 100% in that?

The only other options are: Mid cap - FSMAX. Small cap - NRGSX (Neuberger Bergman Genesis Fund) with an expense ratio of 0.74% and finally international funds, FSGGX or DODFX (Dodge and Cox international stock) with exp ratio 0.62% .

I hope this is enough information and someone can help me or at least can point me in the right direction.

Thank you so much!",2024-07-17,9,28

ORLY is currently priced at $975.13 per share with a market cap of $57.4 billion, but its P/E is higher at 24.75.

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

I haven't pulled the trigger on anything yet because I turn 59.5 tomorrow and can move my 401K into an IRA that I have a lot more control over.

JEPI has a little higher yield of %6.8 and is a diversified ETF but it has an expense ratio or .35 and its yield is kind of all over the place.

O has a %5.8 yield and has had a falling nav recently BUT it has no expense ratio, has a track record of increasing growth and has done so for over 29 years regardless of nav.

this will be for an income portfolio. 

I am thinking that while O may yield slightly lower right now in the long run it will generate a lot more income than JEPI.

However, I was fortunate enough to have grandparents that have done very well, especially in the stock market. My grandfather is a value investor, and taught me most of what I know. 

I make roughly anywhere between $1,100 and $1,400 bi-weekly (depending on OT.) I’m working on getting a raise, to put more towards my brokerage account, which I use as both a savings/retirement account. Every 2 weeks I put $200 into my brokerage, and invest as I see fit.

My goal is to dollar cost average some ETFs such as VOO and VTI, but also some dividend stocks I see worthwhile. Once I have a solid longterm/retirement portfolio (and possibly am making more money) I plan to get more aggressive in terms of individual stocks. I’ve already bought 10 shares of Nu Holdings Ltd. which accounts for 25% of my $400 portfolio so far.

17qwnm0_O,O,Disney up almost 5% aftermarket after showing Disney+ growth and 7% revenue growth Y.o.Y,"Live Earning Call updates at the bottom

&#x200B;

**Bullish Highlights:**

\- Revenue Growth: Q4 revenues increased by 5%, with a 7% rise year-over-year (YOY).

\- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Q4 EPS from continuing operations rose to $0.14 from $0.09 YOY.

\- Adjusted EPS: When excluding certain items, Q4 EPS jumped to $0.82 from $0.30, and annual EPS increased to $3.76 from $3.53.

\- Subscriber Growth: Disney+ added a strong 7 million subscribers in Q4.

\- Parks and Experiences: Operating income soared over 30% YOY, with growth across all segments.

\- Cost Efficiency: The company has raised its annualized efficiency target to $7.5 billion, up from $5.5 billion.

\- Free Cash Flow: There's an expectation of significant growth in FY24, with targets set to reach pre-pandemic levels.

&#x200B;

**Bearish Considerations:**

\- Annual EPS Decline: Despite a strong quarter, annual EPS fell to $1.29 from $1.75.

\- Wage Inflation: The company is managing against wage inflation and challenging comparisons to the previous year's 50th-anniversary celebrations at Walt Disney World.

&#x200B;

**Forward Outlook:**

\- Disney anticipates its streaming services to achieve profitability by Q4 of FY24, though they caution that progress may be uneven quarter to quarter.

\- The company is bullish on ESPN's growth and its evolution into a leading digital sports platform.

\- There's a focus on improving the economics of film studios and turbocharging growth in the parks and experiences sector.

&#x200B;

**CEO's Perspective:**

Robert A. Iger, CEO, expressed optimism about the company's trajectory. He emphasized the foundational work done over the past year, which positions Disney to move from a period of restructuring to a phase of growth. Iger outlined four key areas for future success: streaming profitability, ESPN's digital transformation, film studio output, and parks and experiences growth. He's bullish on the opportunities ahead and is focused on creating lasting growth and increasing shareholder value.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Earnings Call Just in:

\- Board recommends instating dividend at the end of the year.

\- Pricing for Disney+ are expected to go up as they look towards growing the digital streaming business. They mention bundeling Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN. They also want to counter account sharing, similar to what Netflix did.

\- When competing with Netflix, Disney believes their IP and its quality gives them the ability to dial down expenses on marketing and 'series expenses', improving their margins compared to competitors

\- Disney plans to lean more into ESPN, stating it is the 'most popular brand on TikTok'. They are quite bullish about it.

\- FCF growth improvement is dedicated to decreased content spend. Whether or not they can keep up this trend is anyone's guess.

\- Disney does not want to license their core IP to Netflix. Even if licensing would provide some 'quick bucks', they think it undermines their value proposition and long term strategy for Disney+

\- Outlook on parks and cruises: Disney expects the performance of the parks and its cruises, both domestically and internationally, to keep growing. They mention not seeing any impact on the numbers from tougher economic conditions.

16xeyeu_SPG,SPG,DON'T BUY O !!! - The Impact of Rising Interest Rates on REIT Funds: A Closer Look,"Hi Guys,

I wanted to share some of my insights about Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and why they might not be the best investment option, I've seen a lot of chat about O and some other REIT funds and I wanted to put out some of my findings from a value-based investment perspective so that anyone thinking of buying more O stock have some things to consider. I have recently been researching REITs and some of the findings I'm seeing are quite shocking to me, to say the least. especially what I saw in MPT spreadsheets.

**Why are REIT Funds Vulnerable to Rising Interest Rates?**

When interest rates go up, it can have several adverse effects on REIT funds:

1. **Increased Borrowing Costs:** REITs often rely on debt financing to acquire and manage properties. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing goes up, which can erode their profit margins. - for now, forget about any growth for REITS in this environment, they simply can't afford to get new loans to expand into new property projects, especially the ones with existing debt.
2. **Lower Attractiveness Relative to Bonds:** Rising interest rates make bonds and other fixed-income investments more appealing compared to REITs. Investors may shift their capital away from REITs in search of higher yields in the bond market. the yields are high too.
3. **Declining Property Values:** Higher interest rates can lead to a slowdown in the real estate market. This can result in reduced property values, affecting the overall value of the REIT's property portfolio. - this one is massive!!!! - this is mainly why REIT funds like O have been getting slammed, when looking through the balance sheet there is a segment in expenses called "" Real estate depreciation and amortization "" - this goes on the balance sheet as a loss and is really a representation to the falling depreciation of the asset AKA the property itself, these losses are huge because the 'asset of the property is in the 'Billions' / 'Millions' so if the underlying property under ownership devalues with the market by say 20% which in many areas subject to the location they have been this is negatively effecting a lot of these REIT earnings as it gets deducted from the net- profit.

**How a Falling Property Market Impacts REIT Balance Sheets:**

A falling property market can have a significant impact on REITs:

1. **Asset Depreciation:** A declining property market can lead to a decrease in property values, causing REITs to report lower asset values on their balance sheets.
2. **Rental Income Reduction:** As property demand weakens, rental income may decrease. REITs rely on consistent rental income to pay dividends to shareholders.
3. **Difficulty in Raising Capital:** In a bearish property market, it can be challenging for REITs to raise capital through property sales or new investments. This can limit their ability to grow their portfolios.

**Why Understanding These Factors Matters:**

It's important to consider these factors when evaluating the potential risks associated with REIT investments, especially in an environment of rising interest rates and a shaky property market. It's not that REITs are always a bad investment, but they can be more sensitive to these economic changes.

There will most likely be contagion effects if some of these REITs go bust and I expect stability to come once property market prices stabilise and stop falling. If some Institutions start dumping REIT holdings then this might even be the cause of a market black swan, the real estate sector plays a very big part in the Banking/Finance sector and it's scary to see these things drop... there could be a buying opportunity and that's what triggered me to do this research - some great REITS iv found have been - STWD / SPG / VICI / PLD / O and I'm very open to more ideas...... I just want to send the strong message here that my findings in the financial data that are more found directly under the trust's websites especially MPT  there is some real ugliness to the financial sheets when these numbers are put in from the asset depreciation. ( REAL ESTATE DEPREDATIONS AND AMORTIZATION ) to be precise. I am not saying hey look these things are a buy now I'm more just saying be bloody careful loading into these assets in this current environment, Long term yeah sure they will probably bounce back but in the short to mid term some of these might bust.

Please feel free to share your thoughts and insights on this topic. I'm open to a collaborative approach and would love to hear about any ideas or strategies you have regarding dividend stocks or asset growth in these challenging conditions. Let's discuss further!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

03 / 10 / 2023 UPDATE:

Hello Everyone,

I appreciate the overwhelming response to my post yesterday on REITs. I didn't expect it to gain so much traction, and I apologize for not diving deeper into my research on Realty Income Corporation (O).

I want to clarify that my post was not intended to offend anyone or provide financial advice. The information and terminology may not be 100% accurate; they are merely my thoughts and opinions. My interest in REITs sparked this discussion, as I've been doing some preliminary research on them.

Regarding the title ""DONT BUY O,"" I apologize for the clickbait. I'm actually interested in O and believe in the stock, but the entire REIT sector may face more downside. This isn't just a 'dip'; it's more of a sector-wide correction. While retail investors like us don't have the same impact as institutional investors, it's essential to consider the macro environment and the reasons behind the sector's repricing.

I'm not predicting the future here; I'm just urging caution. It's uncertain whether O or the REIT sector will bounce back in the short term. Long-term, O could be a solid investment, but there's a possibility it could drop to the $30-$40 range next year. Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just sharing my perspectives to open discussion and knowledge.

For those interested in more of my stock picks and content, feel free to check out my YouTube channel. The link is in my profile.

Iv done some investigational work into some other REIT funds and given them a ranking score calculated from three key metrics: Dividend Yield, EBITDA, and PE Ratio:

Ranking by Value Score

1. Blackstone Mortgage Trust - 8.3 ........div yield = 11.4%
2. Simon Property Group - 8.1  ..........div yield = 7.04%
3. Starwood Property Trust - 7.9 .......div yield =  9.95%
4. VICI Properties - 7.8 ........div yield =  5.03%
5. Boston Properties - 7.5 ......div yield = 6.79%
6. Vornado Realty Trust - 7.2 .......div yield = 10.05%
7. Realty Income Corporation - 7.0 .......div yield = 6.19%
8. Digital Realty Trust - 6.9  .......div yield =  4.03%

Hello Everyone,

I appreciate the overwhelming response to my post yesterday on REITs. I didn't expect it to gain so much traction, and I apologize for not diving deeper into my research on Realty Income Corporation (O).

I want to clarify that my post was not intended to offend anyone or provide financial advice. The information and terminology may not be 100% accurate; they are merely my thoughts and opinions. My interest in REITs sparked this discussion, as I've been doing some preliminary research on them.

Regarding the title ""DONT BUY O,"" I apologize for the clickbait. I'm actually interested in O and believe in the stock, but the entire REIT sector may face more downside. This isn't just a 'dip'; it's more of a sector-wide correction. While retail investors like us don't have the same impact as institutional investors, it's essential to consider the macro environment and the reasons behind the sector's repricing.

I'm not predicting the future here; I'm just urging caution. It's uncertain whether O or the REIT sector will bounce back in the short term. Long-term, O could be a solid investment, but there's a possibility it could drop to the $30-$40 range next year. Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just sharing my perspectives to open discussion and knowledge.

16xeyeu_O,O,DON'T BUY O !!! - The Impact of Rising Interest Rates on REIT Funds: A Closer Look,"Hi Guys,

I wanted to share some of my insights about Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and why they might not be the best investment option, I've seen a lot of chat about O and some other REIT funds and I wanted to put out some of my findings from a value-based investment perspective so that anyone thinking of buying more O stock have some things to consider. I have recently been researching REITs and some of the findings I'm seeing are quite shocking to me, to say the least. especially what I saw in MPT spreadsheets.

**Why are REIT Funds Vulnerable to Rising Interest Rates?**

When interest rates go up, it can have several adverse effects on REIT funds:

1. **Increased Borrowing Costs:** REITs often rely on debt financing to acquire and manage properties. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing goes up, which can erode their profit margins. - for now, forget about any growth for REITS in this environment, they simply can't afford to get new loans to expand into new property projects, especially the ones with existing debt.
2. **Lower Attractiveness Relative to Bonds:** Rising interest rates make bonds and other fixed-income investments more appealing compared to REITs. Investors may shift their capital away from REITs in search of higher yields in the bond market. the yields are high too.
3. **Declining Property Values:** Higher interest rates can lead to a slowdown in the real estate market. This can result in reduced property values, affecting the overall value of the REIT's property portfolio. - this one is massive!!!! - this is mainly why REIT funds like O have been getting slammed, when looking through the balance sheet there is a segment in expenses called "" Real estate depreciation and amortization "" - this goes on the balance sheet as a loss and is really a representation to the falling depreciation of the asset AKA the property itself, these losses are huge because the 'asset of the property is in the 'Billions' / 'Millions' so if the underlying property under ownership devalues with the market by say 20% which in many areas subject to the location they have been this is negatively effecting a lot of these REIT earnings as it gets deducted from the net- profit.

**How a Falling Property Market Impacts REIT Balance Sheets:**

A falling property market can have a significant impact on REITs:

1. **Asset Depreciation:** A declining property market can lead to a decrease in property values, causing REITs to report lower asset values on their balance sheets.
2. **Rental Income Reduction:** As property demand weakens, rental income may decrease. REITs rely on consistent rental income to pay dividends to shareholders.
3. **Difficulty in Raising Capital:** In a bearish property market, it can be challenging for REITs to raise capital through property sales or new investments. This can limit their ability to grow their portfolios.

**Why Understanding These Factors Matters:**

It's important to consider these factors when evaluating the potential risks associated with REIT investments, especially in an environment of rising interest rates and a shaky property market. It's not that REITs are always a bad investment, but they can be more sensitive to these economic changes.

There will most likely be contagion effects if some of these REITs go bust and I expect stability to come once property market prices stabilise and stop falling. If some Institutions start dumping REIT holdings then this might even be the cause of a market black swan, the real estate sector plays a very big part in the Banking/Finance sector and it's scary to see these things drop... there could be a buying opportunity and that's what triggered me to do this research - some great REITS iv found have been - STWD / SPG / VICI / PLD / O and I'm very open to more ideas......

16tnkgc_DG,DG,Realty Income ( O ) - Quick Analysis and Valuation,"I've seen a lot posts about Realty Income, but no one is actually analysing the company, so I decided to have a quick look into it, I hope it gives you some value.  


**Profitability - Good**  
Realty income revenue keeps growing every year at meaningful rates, which is great,  FFO growth is close to two digits, so this company keeps being highly profitable and they are still able to growth it.   


**Financials - Medium-Good**  
**Credit Rating** \- **A-** Very good for REIT's

**Current ratio** (discounting intangibles) is **2.2** \- Very good  
**Debt to Gross Book Value** \- **42%** \- Good - For REIT's I tend to avoid when this is above 50%, below 50% is fine, below 40% is great.  
**Net Debt To EBITDA** \- **5.90** \- Medium - I would prefer to see this below 5.5. But is nothing super worrying.  
**WACC** \- **9.42% -** Which is the expectable return for shareholders, would like to see it at 10-12%, not great, not terrible  
**NAV/Share - 37.55** \- The ideia here is to see it below current stock price,  because when NAV > Share price, it probably is because something really bad is going on and you should avoid it if you don't understand the situation that is discounted the stock that much.  


**Dividend Safety - The dividend looks safe**  
**FFO payout ratio = 75%** \- which is great!  
**CAD payout ratio = 82.5%** , which is also great, CAD means Cash available for distribution, is not very mentioned, but it's the closest you can get to see how able the company can afford the dividend.  
**Debt to Gross Book Value** \- **42% -** Below 50%, so I consider it's ok.  


Two tips I leave here to solidify your dividend safety theory, (didn't include on this quick analysis, leave it for you)  
1 - **Types of properties** \- REIT's that own property types with short-term lease revenues carry more risk cutting their dividends than those with longer-terms - I believe O is in the long-term ones.  
2 - **Dividend Yield to Industry Average -** REITs with dividend yields that materially exceed industry average tend to be companies with significantly more corporate risk and less secure dividends, one recent example of this was MPW.

  
**Valuation**  
Valuations are always based on assumptions and metrics, so I'm going to show valuation based on Dividends Yield, P/FFO and Dividend discount model.  


**P/FFO Valuation - 68.63$**  
Latest FFO/Share is 4.11 .  
Highest P/FFO for O is 21.10 , which would price O at 86.74$.  
Average P/FFO for O is 16.69 , which would price O at **68.63$.**  
Lowest P/FFO for O is 13.47 , which would price O at 55.39$.  


If we base our valuation on P/FFO Metric, O is trading today at a discounted price.  


**Dividend Yield Valuation - 63.81$**  
Current dividend per share is 3.07.  
Highest dividend yield for O was 6.45%, which would price O at 47.75$.  
Average dividend yield for O is 4.83%, which would price O at **63.81$.**  
Lowest dividend yield for O was 3.84%, which would price O at 80.29$.  


If we base our valuation in Dividend yield metric, O is trading today at a discounted price.

**Discounted Discount Model Valuation - 45.62$**  
Average dividend growth last 5 years = 3.24%  
Assumed discount rate = 10%  
Fair price based on DDM = **45.62$**   


If we use DDM to calculate fair price, O is still expensive at today's price.  


**Conclusions:**  
\- Overall I think everything is fine with Realty Income and nothing too serious to worry about, and the stock is going down because is natural at current market conditions, we are coming from a overpriced market, with interest rates rising, is normal to see corrections of 10-15%.  
\- If you use this data to take financial decisions, please validate all the numbers, as they can be wrong.  
\- About valuations, consider the ""lowest"" possibilities, as current economy conditions are not the best.  
\- Don't just buy O blindly, don't let single stock have significant % of your portfolio.",2023-09-27,203,86

I lost my user name, but I was the author of this. 

The thing you have to learn about the markets....is that bonds move stocks, not the other way around. This is especially true for rate sensitive / bond proxy stocks like REITs, CPGs and Utilities.

16oqys9_O,O,$O frenzy and why you should STFU,"The only asset mentioned on this sub as much as SCHD and JEPI, for months and months and months, over and over again. Realty Income. REIT. Good source of dividend income with mild to none growth expected, the solid dividend with solid track record. Interest rates go up, REITs go down. So it goes. 

$O goes down. Why are you freaking out? This is why retail is actually losing money. And why it's called dumb money. Because people can be amazingly dumb. And this sub is a prime example showcase of that right now. Buy high, sell low; that's exactly what people (not only) here appear to be doing. Why did you buy $O to begin with? Did you do your own research and due diligence or you just followed Reddit or other shit talk sites and sheeped into it? What changed about the company itself now that you all freak out and wanna suddenly sell? At the time you're supposed to be having a good opportunity to actually load up big time and enjoy the result of it 5 to 10 years from now? Seriously, wtf? 

You sell now and when $O will recover and go back to $70, the whole sub will be like ""is it too late to get in?"". Yeah, it bloody will be too late you dumb helmets... If you think $O fundamentally changed as a company or something is wrong within it and its price is going down because of it, sell and don't come back to it and STFU. If this is not the case and you believe the price is going down due to external reasons, such as interest rates, you should perhaps STFU and keep doing what you've been doing. I'll keep allocating the same 7% that is dedicated to REITs in my portfolio, like I do every damn month...

Logic tells me - I'm going to get the tax hit anyway - might as well just go Roth.

14ccbyl_NET,NET,"Am I 'Valuing' my stocks/funds right? ($O, $ADC, $PDI, $MAIN, $NET, $MAR, $AD)","I'm wanting some opinions on 'valuations' on my portfolio and if what I'm looking at is 'correct' or if I'm 'off'.  
I own 7 holdings ($NET-UN, $AD-UN, $MAIN, $O, $ADC, $PDI, $MAR-UN) all of which I have varying reasons for (mostly dividend growth, tax free income (TFSA), etc.)

**My portfolio is currently:**

Ticker - shares @ price - % of total portfolio

* **$PDI** \- 70 shares @ $17.94 (12.5% yield) -  30.5%
* **$NET-UN** \- 200 shares @ $4.99 (6.9% yield) - 19.3%
* **$ADC** \- 10 shares @ $64.40 ( 3.85%) -15.6%
* **$O** \- 10 shares @ $58.47 (4.46%) - 13.6%
* **$MAIN** \-  10 shares @ $39.16 (5.99% yield) - 9.4%
* **$AD-UN** \- 30 shares @ $15.44 (8.8% yield) - 8.3%
* **$MAR-UN** \- 200 shares @ $0.58 (2.5% yield) - 3.3%

**Sectors:**

* **REITs (Diverse):** 51.9%
* **Debt/Loans/Bonds:** 30.5%
* **BDC:** 9.3%
* **Private Equity:** 8.3%

Since I'm 25, and loving the REIT sector as of late (I just see more deals in this sector specifically thanks to raising interest rates). I have been going a little 'insane' with it. I plan to add a few more REITs (MHC-UN, MPW (a FAT maybe), AP-UN (a FAT maybe), BTB-UN) then ignore it for the foreseeable future.

I'm valuing stocks off their dividend history, payout ratio history, sustainability/growth (UNII, AFFO, NII, DNII, FCF, etc.), and stock performance. But also going off their P/AFFO, P/FCF, P/UNII, P/DNII, etc. Which I think shows if a stock is trading 'at par', above, or below its normal valuation.

Note: I really enjoy researching stocks so if this seems like 'overkill' just know its extremely relaxing and I love doing this.

P/NII (Consolidated with absorbed fund):

Because PDI shares its annual results around Aug. we don't have any updated numbers to go off of so we will go off their NII (Net Investment Income + Realized gains) / shares outstanding to get a NII per share.  
Their results are an absolute mess due to the share price falling since Jun 2021, and varying NII before the merger in 2022 jumped the NII up a large amount.

zms6um_O,O,Shaquille O'Neal distances himself from crypto and FTX collapse: ‘I was just a paid spokesperson’,"Shaquille O’Neal wants to make one thing clear: He doesn’t believe in crypto, if he ever did.

That’s after being named in a class-action lawsuit against now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX last month, for promoting the company in a June commercial.

In an interview with CNBC Make It this week, the 50-year-old businessman and Basketball Hall of Famer took questions about his relationship with FTX while discussing his other business ventures.

O’Neal has a long history of investing in companies he promotes, including his current enterprise, Shaq’s Fun House, an annual part-festival, part-carnival event. Those investments often pan out: O’Neal makes more off the court than he did as an NBA star, he told HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” in 2018.

But when it comes to FTX, he says, he was merely a celebrity in an ad.

“A lot of people think I’m involved, but I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial,” O’Neal says.

wp0fig_O,O,"Kevin O'Leary says on the arrest of Tornado Cash Dev: “At the end of the day, it’s okay to arrest that guy. Why? He’s messing with the primal forces of regulation","Over the last few days, the crypto-verse witnessed the downfall of a successful project. Tornado Cash was undoubtedly a hotbed for hackers. Since the details of transactions are often hidden on the Ethereum-based platform, illegal funds were laundered on it. The US government imposed sanctions on the platform, and Dutch authorities followed suit by arresting the platform’s developer. While some were against this as it meddled with the decentralization factor of the industry, Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, was rather glad about the ordeal.

O’Leary suggested that crypto mixers like Tornado Cash were linked to the “crypto cowboy culture.” Until this existed, the likelihood of increased institutional interest in crypto was relatively low, he noted. He further added,

“I think we’re getting to that stage now. Maybe we’re in the third or fourth inning towards that, but I’m tired of this crypto cowboy crap. I want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work. I don’t need to be a crypto cowboy, and I don’t want to be one because I work in the regulated world.”

“At the end of the day, it’s okay to arrest that guy. Why? He’s messing with the primal forces of regulation \[…\] If we have to sacrifice him, that’s okay, because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital.”

He further suggested that the crypto-verse should emerge as a “rules-based environment.” Only then will it lure in more institutional capital.

vaqmzw_PLD,PLD,Why is everyone only looking at O?,"While Realty Income Corporation is a very good dividend stock, there are better options around. One such company is Choice Properties REIT (CHP-UN.TO). The stock is currently at $14.38 and carries a 5.15% yearly dividend yield. Its P/E ratio is a very sustainable 9.98, which is one of the best in all the Real Estate industry. To compare, O has a yearly dividend yield of 4.49% and a P/E ratio of 66.96, which is higher than the S&P Real Estate Fund's (XLRE) P/E ratio of 44.64 as of March 31, 2022.
The current price of O is $65.96. Considering that CHP-UN.TO is a newer company than O and already has a higher EPS should be the final straw. Please comment if you have any objections

TROW yields a nice 3.78% with a 10-yr avg yield of 3.04%. They are up 75% overall through the past 5 years. With a forward PE of 12.07, why am I hesitant on TROW?

v3dh0r_O,O,Is this still scalping? Did anyone trade Tesla from around 11 to 12 o'clock?,"I dry tested watching the price action on 1min bars today. I started with QQQ and was up almost nothing after an hour. I switched to Tesla and had quite success. I had a phase where I was about 3 to 4% ahead but blew it on the point when it continued to climb like 30min before lunch (11:30) when I insisted it goes down (=having a bias against market trend which was in a slightly up trend) and went down to 1.5% overall for 1 hour active trading.

I did about 30 to 40 trades this hour. 

I was best when I was constantly  speculating what the buyers / sellers think and when the people on  the side line step in and force the issue. I also identified that new players seemed to have arrived as the mood has changed.

It appears that I might have missed some relevant news as the market slightly turned.

\-

I did not found it stressful (well it was not real money at the moment anyways) since I was not attached to my trades as I did not care to lose since the next one is around the corner. I had barely fear of missing out. I controlled my greed most of the time as I stopped trades earlier and did not hated me for stopping mid-trade.

I will try this kind of trading for the next days and see if I can be profitable in the long run or if this was just a fluke and it was just an easy day to trade Tesla. But I made the most in the side way movement and not the clear cut up-trend movement where I lost my marbles a bit, sit on my hands for some min and changed my perspective and went positive again.

\-

Q1: I guess doing 20-40 trades per hour is still scalping or not?

Q2: Are there any posts here on reddit or some good reads on the internet/books regarding scalping? 

Q3: What were the most important insides that made you good at scalping? 

Q4: Have you traded Tesla today? It appeared to be 'easily' tradable in 5 + 15min doing 2 or 3 trades. 

Q5: Did you scalped Tesla today? What was your experience?

Q6: I was not thinking about SL that much but I had a hard stop in my head where I was aborting one or two trades. When scalping (I guess using hotkeys) are you set some last resort SLs like 0.5% or something?

Q7: Is scalping on a daily basis something one can do for years to come or should I focus more on slow trading and do scalping only if I wait for setups?

sysniy_O,O,"Information on Geopolitics, Geology, O&G and Russia/Ukraine.","  Hi all,

Thought I would do a write up for you. I have noticed quite a bit of inaccurate information on this sub-reddit regarding oil and gas. I have a background that is pretty specialized. Non-renewable commodities focused economics background, alongside an international relations, and geology background.

**First things first, some petroleum engineering/geology**: Natural gas is considered a byproduct of petroleum. Meaning they are often found together, however most of this will be oil.

If you look at the U.S. crude oil, and natural gas production graphs found here [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/#oil-tab](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/#oil-tab) you will notice that they look incredibly similar.

You cannot transport oil and natural gas in the same pipeline. They require two different pipelines.

The cost to produce a barrel of oil largely depends on the geology of the area, in addition to the business environment. If you google “most oil reserves by country” you will notice something odd. Venezuela has the more reserves than most other countries, but produces next to none. That’s because the geology is bad, and their break even price is around $120. [https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-loves-a-discount-but-wheres-the-support-for-oil-prices-2014-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-loves-a-discount-but-wheres-the-support-for-oil-prices-2014-11) 

We will see an increase in the price of oil and gas, but this also presents new opportunities for countries with high break-even prices. An example of this could be Canada, who needed a WTI price between $85 to $95 in order to break even according to IHS Markit in 2016. [https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/production-cost-and-the-canadian-oil-sands-in-a-lower-price-environment.html](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/production-cost-and-the-canadian-oil-sands-in-a-lower-price-environment.html) 

Break even price readings:

[https://knoema.com/infographics/vyronoe/cost-of-oil-production-by-country](https://knoema.com/infographics/vyronoe/cost-of-oil-production-by-country) 

**So these companies will just produce more, right?**

First off, let me say that the idea we are “running out of oil” is incorrect, and inherently flawed. We typically discover more oil than we consume every year. From 1991-2011 the global consumption of oil grew by 32%, but the reserves (economically viable to extract) increased by 60%. [https://www.worldenergy.org/assets/images/imported/2013/10/WER\_2013\_2\_Oil.pdf](https://www.worldenergy.org/assets/images/imported/2013/10/WER_2013_2_Oil.pdf) 

COVID-19 put a pause on the exploration of oil and gas. This could be a **serious** problem. Oil reserves flat lined and have remained relatively the same in recent years. For smaller O&G producers, they may not want to produce more oil until they get more reserves. If their reserves are not growing at a higher rate than their production, eventually they will be out of business.

In simple terms: Imagine you are living off of a savings or investment account. You spend 50k a year, but you gain 60k from interest/investing every year. Eventually you can start to spend more. But there is a multi year stretch where you are still spending 50k a year, but you are only gaining 40k in income. You know this is not sustainable in the long term. You either a) have to spend less, or b) have to get more interest/gains from investing. You cannot continue down this path. There are some oil & gas companies in this situation.

**Russia/Ukraine and Pipelines:**

[https://mondediplo.com/maps/gas-pipelines](https://mondediplo.com/maps/gas-pipelines) 

[https://www.nationalgeographic.org/photo/europe-map/](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/photo/europe-map/) 

Most of the pipeline and LNG carriers in the area run through Ukraine. Logically, if war breaks out, Ukraine will not continue to allow Russia to transport on pipelines going through their country. This leaves only the pipelines so the north that run through Belarus, Poland, etc. But they do not have the capacity to supply the rest of the E.U.. The E.U. will likely sanction Russia, and refuse to buy their oil and gas. Ukraine does produce a fair bit of natural gas, but if there is a war, it is highly unlikely they will be worried about producing this for export to other countries.

The transport time to get oil and gas from other countries to the European Union could be a few weeks or more. The Persian Gulf area is close by, but this requires going through the Suez Canal, which can only take the 2nd largest tanker. There is about 571 of them globally. It can be done, but it will be a challenge to quickly meet their supply.

One topic that is not being discussed in here is the North Sea oil producers. Norway has a substantial oil industry, and can quickly supply the U.K., Germany, France, etc. It could be very likely that the EU tries to encourage companies in this area to ramp up production, to alleviate their pain. This can be achieved easiest since Norway has a state-run oil company.

**TLDR:**

Oil and gas production and prices will go up. Chance to see producers in countries with bad geology make record profits. Russia likely sanctioned, and Russia to Ukraine to Europe pipelines likely will be shut off. Potential for North Sea/Norwegian oil companies begin to produce lots more oil, as it is the closet location, and can quickly alleviate supply shocks compared to shipping from Middle East or USA.",2022-02-22,23,21

stuc0f_O,O,Wynn Resorts (WYNN) sells land and buildings for Boston-based Encore Resort & Casino to Realty Income (O) for $1.7 billion,"This seems pertinent for anybody interested in the leisure & entertainment, gaming, or real estate industries.  To be clear, this is a triple net (NNN) lease which seems to benefit both companies and, subjectively, may be moot as far as locals are concerned.

**Pros for Realty Income**: new exposure to the gaming industry, increased market share in a prime area in the northeast, partnership with an industry leader, consistent and low risk rental income for the longterm, and no worry about handling operations due to the nature of the lease

**Pros for Wynn:** immediate recognition of $1.7 billion USD, continued use of the site and options to expand, retention of its Mass. Gaming Commission license (one of two in the state whereas the other is owned by competitor MGM), partnership with an industry leader, a lower rent with flexible land use for thirty (30) year period with optional renewal as it attempts to grow customer base

**Cons**: Wynn assumes all expenses related to tax, insurance, maintenance, etc. on top of rent due to the nature of the lease, Wynn faces brutal in-state and regional competition with MGM Springfield, Twin Rivers, Plainridge Park, and tribally-owned powerhouses Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun Casinos

My take is that this is good for longterm investors of both companies and allows them to continue in their respective expertise rather than meddling in the unknown.  My concern remains, ""an hour drive and I'm at Foxwoods and Mohegan,"" which are behemoths in their own right.  The expansive properties rival shopping malls and concert venues and are collectively ""the Vegas of the east.""  Not to mention Encore isn't even in Boston and last I heard tried to charge $40 for parking without the added amenities of the aforementioned Connecticut resort & casinos.

sr1ij0_CVX,CVX,"When to Take Profit in O&G Producers, Again?","Hi all,

As usual, I am writing this to (a) bounce around ideas and (b) have something written down to check my own self-selective biases and to evaluate my track record as an investor EOY.

I was long in O&G for 2020 (bought XOM at around $32\*), rode the Delta Wave in 2021, saw a possibility of making a few extra percentages during Omicron. So I exited O&G, shorted them, exited the shorts and then re-entered on the long side. As oil equities have risen around 10-30% YTD, I am again faced with the question: **""what now?""**

* \*As WTI rose, the risk curve of investing in oil equities shift leftward. To maintain my risk appetite and return, I started transitioning to more levered bets on oil (so XOM to OXY, PDS, OVV). The downside of this is that these names are more sensitive to WTI movement both ups and downs, within a range.

**Valuation-wise,** O&G equities are still quite attractive compared to where WTI is. Depending on the stickers and where WTI will be in the next 6 months (as long as it stays btw $65-75/bbl), I think o&g equities have another 10-50% run from here. If bad comes to worse, it's still likely that o&g will yield between 10-30% FCF for 2022, absent a recession.

**WTI price-wise**, $90/bbl WTI, if adjusted for inflation, is actually only equal to about $72 in 2010. Expenses associated with energy consumption as a percentage of GDP per capita (60k today vs. 48k in 2010) are also not outrageous. Unlike most of the oil bulls, I expect the break-even price will rise with inflation as costs of labor and new equipment rise, at least in the short term. If break-even rises to $65/bbl, that $90 WTI doesn't seem so outrageous anymore.

**Supply-demand imbalance**, there is a considerable consensus among heads of commodity traders of the big banks (with a vocal minority of opposing views) that we're still in the early innings of an energy supercycle. Also, the IEA recently [published their report pushing back their previous timeline of when supply will outstrip demand](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022). FWIW, the above views are the market's views.

* I continue to have a middle-of-the-road view btw the two extremes presented by the mega bulls and bears of oil. Conservatively, I think it's safe to say that WTI will continue to stay rangebound btw $65-75/bbl for 2022. However, I expect US shales will become a significant player again and supply will start outstripping demand in 2H2022.
* As such, I have and continue to position my portfolio toward O&G servicers and equipment. Historically, the servicers' profitability lagged the producers by about 18 months. At this point, I am fairly confident that this pattern will repeat this time, absent a recession.

**Mass-psychology wise**, I continue to think we're in the very early innings of mass euphoria in O&G. There is little to no pumping of O&G in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) or [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/).

sr1ofx_O,O,"When To Take Profit In O&G Producers, Again?","Hi all,

As usual, I am writing this to (a) bounce around ideas and (b) have something written down to check my own self-selective biases and to evaluate my track record as an investor EOY.

I was long in O&G for 2020 (bought XOM at around $32\*), rode the Delta Wave in 2021, saw a possibility of making a few extra percentages during Omicron. So I exited O&G, shorted them, exited the shorts and then re-entered on the long side. As oil equities have risen around 10-30% YTD, I am again faced with the question: **""what now?""**

* \*As WTI rose, the risk curve of investing in oil equities shift leftward. To maintain my risk appetite and return, I started transitioning to more levered bets on oil (so XOM to OXY, PDS, OVV). The downside of this is that these names are more sensitive to WTI movement both ups and downs, within a range.

**Valuation-wise,** O&G equities are still quite attractive compared to where WTI is. Depending on the stickers and where WTI will be in the next 6 months (as long as it stays btw $65-75/bbl), I think o&g equities have another 10-50% run from here. If bad comes to worse, it's still likely that o&g will yield between 10-30% FCF for 2022, absent a recession.

**WTI price-wise**, $90/bbl WTI, if adjusted for inflation, is actually only equal to about $72 in 2010. Expenses associated with energy consumption as a percentage of GDP per capita (60k today vs. 48k in 2010) are also not outrageous. Unlike most of the oil bulls, I expect the break-even price will rise with inflation as costs of labor and new equipment rise, at least in the short term. If break-even rises to $65/bbl, that $90 WTI doesn't seem so outrageous anymore.

**Supply-demand imbalance**, there is a considerable consensus among heads of commodity traders of the big banks (with a vocal minority of opposing views) that we're still in the early innings of an energy supercycle. Also, the IEA recently [published their report pushing back their previous timeline of when supply will outstrip demand](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022). FWIW, their views are the market's views.

* I continue to have a middle-of-the-road view btw the two extremes presented by the mega bulls and bears of oil. Conservatively, I think it's safe to say that WTI will continue to stay rangebound btw $65-75/bbl for 2022. However, I expect US shales will become a significant player again and supply will start outstripping demand in 2H2022.
* As such, I have and continue to position my portfolio toward O&G servicers and equipment. Historically, the servicers' profitability lagged the producers by about 18 months. At this point, I am fairly confident that this pattern will repeat this time, absent a recession.

**Mass-psychology wise**, I continue to think we're in the very early innings of mass euphoria in O&G. There is little to no pumping of O&G in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) or [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/). When there is mentioning, it's usually household names like XOM or CVX. I joke that I will know that we reach peak euphoria when retail starts peddling pre-revenue O&G names.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

> (In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option (but issued by a bank) that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

> For example, a KO warrant on the S&P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2.22% (note that this is linear because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100. An 11.11% rise in S&P500 to 5000 would mean 500% profit with this specific contract (600 up from 4400).), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (Time decay / No volatility) for another (KO), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

A lot of the set ups/plays I'm seeing have ample time until expiration. It feels like the market is playing chicken with us traders. Traders want to trade but they also want  intrinsic value. 

&#x200B;

This play is no different. Lots of time until expiration and it appears they're targeting that FVG at 10.09 prior to a move high. It did look like it was going to squeeze on the open but patience persevered and then the flow showed me what was up.

Unless we can get up into the upper GEX levels above 13ish lower before higher is the play. This does not mean short. Volume is usually low on this name and Da Boys can and will do whatever they want when they want so be ready for a squeeze.

ok6kky_O,O,O&G Energy Play $CEI Announces Favorable Financing,"Camber Energy is a growth-oriented organization that is leveraging the relationships and expertise of its professionals to build a diversified energy and power solutions company to help service the needs of energy users in North America.

**Ticker: $CEI**

Today, Camber announced the closing of a $15M investment from an institutional investor and separately, extended the maturity date of existing promissory notes from Dec. 2022 To Jan. 2024.

The Company plans to use the funds for working capital, new acquisitions (directly or through the Company's majority-owned subsidiary), and other purposes.

In a separate transaction, the Company extended the maturity date of existing promissory notes from December 11, 2022 to January 1, 2024, and incorporated a conversion feature in each of the promissory notes entitling the holder to convert all or a portion of the principal amount(s) into shares of common stock of the Company at a fixed conversion price of $1.25 per share, which equates to an approx. 117% premium from the closing price of the common shares on July 9, 2021.

We've seen favorable financings like this result in a company's stock shooting higher than the conversion price until the investors begin to convert and put further upward pressure on the stock. It can play out over weeks or months.

$CEI is beginning to gain traction with some highly followed Twitter traders as well so you might want to place this on your watch list.",2021-07-14,19,8
of01ft_GM,GM,21 y/o Canadian's dividend/growth portfolio,"Hello r/dividends!

I've been investing for nearly 2 years now, but have really ramped up my contributions as of November. Today, I did some restructuring of my **long-term** portfolio and believe I've found a stable, dividend producing, growth portfolio (I know some of these are oxymoron's). I wanted to share that with this sub to hopefully get some insight into what things I'm doing right/wrong. So, without further ado here it is!:

* 38 **SCHD** shares @ $75.20 (23.29% of my portfolio) - Dividend yield of **2.72%**
* 130 **REI-UN.TO** shares @ $20.48 (19.32% of my portfolio) - Dividend yield of **4.33%**
* 78 **SRU-UN.TO** shares @ $27.02 (15.36% of my portfolio) - Dividend yield of **6.20%**
* 81 **PSTH** shares @ $26.36 (14.6% of my portfolio)
* 8 **CM.TO** shares @ $141.16 (7.5% of my portfolio) - Dividend yield of **4.13%**
* 10 **VFV.TO** shares @ $91.62 (6.34% of my portfolio) - Dividend yield of **1.27%**
* 10 **GM** shares @ $57.24 (4.66% of my portfolio)
* Remaining **%** comes from a few swing trades that make up >1% of my portfolio.
* \+ a bonus 56 **T.TO** shares @ 25.42 from my jobs share plan.

To be honest, I'm pretty proud of my portfolio since it balances dividends and growth quite well. For my age I'd prefer for my capital gains to be something close to 70% growth and 30% dividends.

All of these stocks are in a **TFSA** meaning I pay 0 capital gains tax on them (aside form 15% withholding tax on U.S. dividends). Please be honest with what I can improve, thanks!",2021-07-06,3,9

nlv3a1_O,O,"ENKS - Undervalued, Profitable - 30% of O. Shares Retired - More Buybacks In Days - 15M Float - 10x+ Bagger","Background: ENKS (Enerkon Solar International) is a solar and hydrogen company with business worldwide. I've been following the stock since late last year when it was $0.05/share. It had an intrinsic value of around $0.40 at the time. It first jumped up to $0.50 (1000% gain), it gradually fell back to $0.20 some weeks later and then jump up to $2.50+ (another 1000%+ gain). It has gradually fell back to around $0.30-$0.40 range once again.

Revenue and income have been increasing year-over-year. In Q1 of 2021, the intrinsic value of this stock increased from $0.40 to $0.60. At today's price of $0.34, this would already be a 2x bagger.

BIG NEWS: Last week, the company announced plans to up-list to NASDAQ. In order to do this, they need to inflate the share price to $4.00/share, which is the minimum requirement to get listed. The company agreed to buy the CEO's 25 million shares in order to reduce the Outstanding Shares by 30%. *This is a ""non-cash, non-debt conversion"" to preferred shares, so as not to disrupt the cashflow and book value and hurt the shareholder.* This has already been completed and brings the intrinsic book value per share (that I calculate) to around $1.00. The company/CEO says a reverse split is out of the question (not good for the shareholder, nor the price), so they plan on continued buybacks, including buybacks of the common shares (reducing the Float) if necessary, with the first round being completed by the end of this week or early next week. That is just the FIRST round.

Here is the link to the news explaining all of that: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enerkon-solar-international-inc-enks-123000774.html)

They have hired 2 companies to perform audits, which should be finished within 8-12 weeks, part of the requirement process of officially getting listed on NASDAQ.

&#x200B;

Outstanding Shares: \~ 45M

Float: 15 Million

Market Cap: \~ $15M

**Current intrinsic value: \~ $1.00 / share**

Current price: $0.34 / share

**Free Cash Available: $17.4M**

&#x200B;

Apparently, there is some kind of 1-day technical delay in getting the official share count number updated online, but it will be roughly a 25M reduction, not including the first round of buybacks happening in the next day or two. So I'm unsure of the exact outstanding share count number. However, the 15M float is certain.

They have more cash available than the current market cap, so I believe the plan is to use that cash for buybacks in order to force the share price to minimum $4.00 for the NASDAQ listing.

So that means 10-12x bagger at a minimum. Once it's on NASDAQ, it will probably go much higher. The fact that this stock has already gone to $2.00 (and made two 1,000%+ runs twice in the last 6 months) - without any kind of buyback news, let alone permanent retirement of 30% of the Outstanding Shares, just makes this awesome. It's also got the ""Biden / Renewable Energy"" factor as well, if you want to count that.

&#x200B;

Disclosure: This is the strongest and most undervalued stock on my list, I've been watching it for many months now - even before the buyback and NASDAQ listing news and their plan to increase the share price to $4.00 using means that preserve shareholder value. I bought around $250,000 worth of this stock, easiest, no-brainer 10x-30x bagger I can think of. 

Given that this stock is grossly undervalued, I own shares at prices far below it's bare-minimum intrinsic value, and many other value investors have also found ENKS to be at the top of their research list as well, I'm feeling pretty safe with this stock.",2021-05-27,1,5

nh6256_DNA,DNA,BNGO is his name O!!!,"**Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** has had the recent momentum with earnings, fundamentals are improving, and the research and technology are **consistently making advancements.** Although it is still considered a speculative growth stock, I believe it is trending in the right in all facets. 

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

**I look forward to the comments and welcome skeptical viewpoints. Open to hearing what other perceptions and expectations are of this company, Thanks for reading!!!!**

I am 27 years old with the following portfolio, which is an aggregate of common stock holdings: TD Robo-Investor, and Roth IRA TD Robo-Investor.

# Portfolio Allocation Summary

|Symbol|Description|Percentage of Portfolio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AGG|iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF|9.50%|
|EMB|iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF|1.41%|
|IPO|Renaissance IPO ETF|1.46%|
|ITOT|iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF|42.07%|
|TSLA|Tesla, Inc. - Common Stock|16.73%|
|VEA|Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF|16.52%|
|VWO|Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF|9.41%|

&#x200B;

Below is a summary of the rate of return for the TD Robo-Investor and TD Robo-Investor Roth IRA, both a combination of AGG, EMB, ITOT, VEA, and VWO.

&#x200B;

The 1 year return seems low compared to the S&P 500 and is making me consider changing things up. Is this rational?

What confirmation would it need to have a higher breakout to $2 target? Minimum 0.69+

It broke high after hours, should I get it premarket? Highly recommended to wait till how it performs the opening market and confirm around 9:30 am-ish to 10am.

gjx5e8_O,O,The Impact of COVID-19 on Realty Income ($O),"Hey guys, I've been doing some analysis on Realty Income ($O) and thought I'd share the COVID-19 section of my analysis for anyone who may be interested.

# Impact of COVID-19

**As of May 1, 2020**:

* Collected 82.9% of contractual rent due for the month of April 2020 (99.9% collection from investment grade tenants).
* In rent deferral discussions with tenants that account for a majority of the unpaid contractual rent - hopefully plans will be put in place, so at worst this revenue will just be delayed rather than lost.

On April 9, 2020, Realty Income borrowed an additional $1.2 billion under its revolving credit facility to increase their cash position to $1.25 billion as a conservative measure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 1, 2020 Realty Income has $1.9 billion in borrowings outstanding under their revolving credit facility, with a remaining available capacity of $1.1 billion. 

Also on April 9, 2020, Realty Income withdrew their 2020 guidance due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Have yet to provide revised guidance.

&#x200B;

# Industry/Tenant Breakdown of Payments

***Significant Industries Affected***;

\* Health and Fitness Industry \- Accounts for 7.2% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however the industry only made up 2.5% of April's income - meaning *only 34.72% of tenants in this industry paid rent*.

\* Restaurants \- Accounts for 8.8% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however the industry only made up 6.3% of April's income - meaning *only 71.59% of the tenants in this industry paid ren*t. 

\* Theatres \- Accounts for 6.0% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however *none of the tenants in this industry paid ren*t in the month of April (a 0% rate).

Smaller Industries affected; Child Care (accounting for 2.2% of the portfolio but *only 31.81% paid*), Automotive Tire services (accounting for 2.1% of the portfolio but *only 71.42% paid*). 

&#x200B;

***Significant Industries which have Not Been Affected***;

\* Convenience Stores \- Account for 12.1% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 12% of April's income (a *99.17% pay rate*).

\* Dollar Stores \- Account for 7.9% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 7.9% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

\* Drug Stores \- Account for 8.6% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 8.5% of April's income (a *98.84% pay rate*).

\* Grocery Stores \- Account for 5.1% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 5.1% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

\* Transportation Stores \- Account for 4.2% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 4.2% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

From this we can see the three primary industries affected by COVID-19 are the fitness industry, restaurants (large portion of payment is from takeways), and theatres. This makes sense as all these industries would have suffered from the lockdowns in place due to consumers being restricted from using their products and these industries essentially having to shut down. It is however, nice to see that a large portion of Realty Incomes' portfolio is made up of tenants from industries that are actually benefiting from the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and transportation). These staple industries make up around 38% of Realty Incomes' portfolio. 

Given the circumstances having an 82.9% collection rate is great, however it is worth noting that going forward this is likely to get worse, esepcially in the short-term (at least the rest of FY20). The industries largely affected by COVID-19 make up roughly 26.3% of Realty Incomes portfolio, given this we could probably estimate that in a 'worst' case scenario roughly around a quarter of Realy Incomes' revenue may be at risk (this is only if the lockdown/COVID-19 issues further deteriorate). With EBT margins for FY2019 being 29% this is a great sign when analysing the 'downside' and risk Covid-19 poses to Realty Income. With the EBT margins being greater than what I believe the worst case hit to revenue will be, it's highly unlikely Realty Income make any substantial losses in the coming months (although obviously income/profit margins will significantly decrease as has already been seen goin from an average of 98% to 82%). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risk Factors**

*Adverse Material Factors*;

\* Deterioration in both Realty Incomes' and their tenants ability to operate \- Due to lockdown/social distancing - *Causing major loss in revenues.*

\* May experience difficulties in leasing, selling or renewing expiring leases \- *Could cause major losses in impairments (selling properties lower than their carry value in weak market conditions)*.

\* May experience difficulty accessing bank lending, capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms, or at all. - *This is highly unlikely at the moment*, especially with the how governments are pumping money into their economies to avoid a situation like this (trying to avoid credit crunch which occured during 2009-2011). *Although if the virus/lockdown continues the quantitive easing we are seeing will not be sustainable and we then could see another credit crunch.*

\* Could negatively impact credit ratings and the interest rates on borrowings.

\* Market value of Realty Incomes' properties may incur impairment charges or asset write-downs.

\* 84% of tenants are Retailers who depend on customer traffic \- *Prolonged lockdown will materially affect business.*

fv4nlv_O,O,GREAT VALUE! $O Realty Corp.,"TLDR; Price > $45 Attractive.

Fellow investors,

As we all know **COVID-19** is affecting every aspect of our lives, but it is also presenting many buying opportunities in our market. **$O Realty Corp** is one of them.

Some Quick Metrics @ $45/SHARE :

* Current Dividend = $0.233 /Month
* Current Yield = 6.21%
* Total Debt to Total Assets = 43.28
* EBITDA = 29.46
* Debt to EBITDA = 5.87
* Price to Book Ratio = 2.51
* RSI = 34 (not oversold yet)
* Price to Cash Flow Ratio = 21.78

Its current drop 47%-%50 from ATH is the largest drop in the company's stock history. 08-09 it was 42%.

Its historical yield has rarely gone over 5%

16.5 % compound annual total return.

4.5% Compound Annualized Dividend Growth.

Consistently Keep Occupancy Above 97 %

Had a public offering of 9,000,000 shares @ 77.40 that closed March 2nd LMAO

""Net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $677 million. The company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,350,000 additional shares of common stock. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings outstanding under its $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and, to the extent not used for that purpose, to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes.""

**Summary**: $O Realty Corp is an **ELITE REIT** that not only trades at a premium to its peers, but rarely trades at an attractive discounted valuation. For long term investors this valuation is an absolute steal. To dividend investors its an opportunity to add world class company to their portfolio.

**RISKS**: **COVID-19** drags on for more than 3 months, dividend possibly in danger. Government Stimulus is currently a ""life-line"" for some businesses that O Realty Corp rents to and if it dries up they go under and O Realty Corp loses a tenant in them. I am sure that Management is doing everything possible to minimize damage and taking advantage of any program and or opportunities that present themselves to fortify the company,",2020-04-05,4,20

They don't just sell games anymore, they also own GameInformer magazine and sell a ton of toys and other stuff. The new Xbox and PS5 will be released before the holidays this year and this is guaranteed to breathe new life into the business at least temporarily.

eb6cxv_O,O,Opportunites for a profitable self-taught algo trader w/o degree or trading firm xp?,"Hi there, 

TLDR; Curious about which employment opportunities exist for a profitable, self-taught retail algorithmic trader, who lacks any degree or trading firm experience?

I've traded crypto markets full-time for 3 years and for 15 of the last 16 months I've turned a good profit. 

The first 18-20 months were strictly discretionary using technical analysis. After a lot of trial and error, I found a simple strategy that I could regularly draw a profit from. This was great, but after a few months I realized that even with a working strategy, discretionary trading is intensive on the mind and if I get sick or something, my only profit stream will dry out. 

So I decided to change path and learn programming to transition over to systematic trading. Since then I stepped into the world of quantitative and algorithmic trading. 

At the beginning of this year I succeeded with designing a basket of trend following algorithms that perform very well in trend-persistent markets like crypto. It started (and never stopped) outperforming my discretionary trading 6 months ago, so now it handles all my capital. It's been profitable for 10 of 10 months. PF 2.9, Sharpe 2.01, 1-10 monthly trades. 

I can program (Python, Pinescript), I know how to data-mine and apply many techniques to avoid curve fitting (out of data sample, limiting degrees of freedom, noise tests, variance tests, restacking data etc.). Prior to discovering trading, I worked for many years with business dev and management in tech companies. In my late 20s. 

Reason I'm looking for opportunities is two-folded: 

1. I want to evolve and learn new techniques from other people. 
2. I want to increase my trading capital.

So, I'm interested in hearing if any opportunities exist for someone with my background? Be full-time, part-time, contract work and whatnot. Only interested in doing remote work. My math skills are mediocre, but I make it work and I can learn anything. 

I appreciate any insight and advice. Thanks!",2019-12-15,8,14

ap9nb3_O,O,24 y/o looking for the best option to invest my savings to make good money rightaway.,"Hello folks, so I have more $15k+ in savings and I don't feel good about it. I'm always thinking on a good way to invest it.

To tell more about myself; I live and work as a cs graduate in a 3rd world country with little expenses and I would love to receive nice instant returns, I hate waiting
:(.

There's a nice option in my country where I buy a car and rent it as an Uber. The renter would pay around $170 weekly but it will have some legal implications or issues in a future. For example if the renter steals the car or crashes it. So it could be a headache.

Other options I have been thinking of are: crypto, Forex and maybe real estate. Problem with real estate is that I live in a 3rd world market, have probably little money to start and got no mentors.

""Robinhood is also launching a new referral program today, designed to lure new users but also teach them how to use the app. Co-founder Baiju Bhatt tells the company was trying to figure out “how do we build a referral program where when the person signs up, they get a unit of our service for free, like with Uber you get a ride for free so you immediately know what Uber does.”

Now when one user refers someone else who signs up, both get one share of a randomly selected company from a set that includes Facebook, Apple, RiteAid, Ford, and General Electric. “Most people who don’t invest in the stock market, their biggest hangup is they don’t know which stock to buy their very first time” Bhatt says. But he insists people should dive in to start learning.""

I'm really interested to see how this pans out, and the full range of referral bonus stocks being offered. Either way, seems like an awesome idea!",2017-04-26,4,12

I ask this because, as being 16, my cash isn't burning a hole in my pocket to be spent and I wouldn't like to put like $100 in and completely lose it because of a lack of prior knowledge.

However it seems that people are willing to pay any price for this stock, driving the yield down to a relatively measly 3.3%  It is extremely over bought based on RSI. If it were simply to return to it's historical dividend yield investors would see losses of >20% which at this yield would be more than 5 years of dividends.

I realize that we are in a low yield environment, and relative to treasuries it might still look attractive.  I'm not sure that in 5 years that will be the case though. In my opinion low rates are coiling a spring that could lead to the next crisis. We assume this new paradigm of low interest rates will last forever, but eventually it will break. An increase of 100 or 200 bps in long term yields could cause massive losses with bond yields so low (or negative). I believe inflation will return 2 or 3%, not 10 or 12 and the US will lead the world kicking and screaming back to higher rates.

4fjkt4_NKE,NKE,Seeking Portfolio Management Advice: 21 y/o,"I am 21 and have a bit of money to play with from a Big 4 internship, so I threw ~$3,500 in a portfolio. As I mentioned, I interned at a Big 4 accounting firm's tax department and accepted a full-time offer with them starting in a little over a year. 

First, I want to say when it comes to stocks, I know way less than I should about valuation and was hoping some of you could point me in the right direction as far as target prices and formulas to determine value.

Second, I would love to hear from anyone else in B4 about how much your firm handcuffs your portfolio and if I should consider this prior to my start date (I want to be long in most, if not all of my positions, but will have to sell some stocks before my start date for independence purposes).

Finally, I should probably note that while I want to hold for long positions, I am looking for pretty aggressive growth considering my age. Approximately half of my portfolio is PEP supplemented with NKE (what I am calling my blue chips), while the rest is Tesla, SolarCity, and a small holding in AMC Entertainment. Looking for contrarian opinions to talk me out of my Muskphalia and suggestions for rapid growth strategies. I have pretty big gains in TSLA and SCTY, which I bought at $215 and $24, respectively, but am unsure what to expect moving forward.

41xtkx_O,O,Investment advice for 24 y/o willing to take risks,"Hi PF,
&nbsp;

I'm a 24 year old making a good income and I want to start moving more money from my low interest savings & checking accounts into the stock market.


I currently have 10K in savings and 15K in checking. I have an additional ~10K in various ETFs and am contributing $1K to my 401K monthly. Does it make sense to keep this much money sitting unused?  
&nbsp;

My current portfolio: 

* 20 Shares VWO Emerging Markets: $570
* 10 Shares TSLA: $1990
* 50 Shares VTI Total Stock Market: $4700
* 10 Shares VBR Small Cap: $1000
* 25 Shares VXUS Total International Stock: $1000  
&nbsp;

Is this a fairly well rounded portfolio? If not, where do you see issues? I'm comfortable sitting on these stocks for a long time as I understand the market will fluctuate, but I'd also be interested in taking significantly more risk than the average investor.
When investing more, would I generally want to increase the number of shares I own in these ETFs or does it make sense to buy other ETFs (such as Schwab or iShares) to diversify further?
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",2016-01-21,12,78
