1fvy9c8_PANW,PANW,PANW still good?,"Thinking about getting into PANW, but wondering if it's still a good buy at current prices or if it's already too expensive with limited growth potential. Thoughts?",2024-10-04,5,14
1fd40em_PANW,PANW,PANW is overvalued,"A blackhat conference video about Cortex XDR was published on YouTube a few days ago.

Most of you will not understand the details of this video but I will summarize it for you. A security researcher was able to completely shit on Cortex XDR (PANW main product to protect computers) and not only disabling it completely, but also abuse it in order to gain the same level of capabilities the XDR has. The guy was able to do the following:

1. Easily understand the detection techniques the XDR uses to prevent certain attacks and bypass them with publicly known techniques
2. Modify the crucial configuration files of the XDR with publicly available and known techniques
3. Cut off the XDR from the updates of the configuration files
4. Disable the protections that prevent you from dumping memory of system critical processes
5. Completely turn off the XDR by tampering with the crucial configuration files
6. Abuse all of the previous issues found to implant his own malware into the XDR and basically let it run with the same level of privilege of the XDR (max privilege), the malware would basically be completely hidden and ""protected"" by the XDR because it runs inside the same process so you can't even terminate it

Why this is interesting? This demonstrates how obsolete and old their XDR is and how low is the protection it offers for it's extremely high price tag. The techniques they use to protect the system are the same used by the cheapest antivirusses you can think of, mostly based of blacklists and whitelists which first of all need to be constantly updated and maintained safe on the local system, but in some cases a list of names is easily bypassable just by changing the file names involved (like the researcher did).

Whats the trade you're gonna ask me now. I don't believe they will go bankrupt or massively drop anytime soon because they have the advantage of a high cost vendor lock-in, which means switching to a different vendor is very expensive. Will they cause a global outage like CRWD did? Possible but impossible to predict when and if it will ever happen.  
  
What I believe is that they will not be able to keep up with the constant evolution of malware. Considering how big and very well known their customers are, if just one of these big bois is compromised, the reputational damage is going to be extremely high. Their XDR is technically considered a ""legacy"" solution, just like CRWD so I won't be surprised to see Falcon XDR getting pwned like Cortex XDR.

So what? The next gen solutions are already here but they are not getting enough attention yet. One of these next gen solutions is Sentinel One (S), their XDR uses a real AI model (not like PANW and CRWD, they don't do shit with AI, it's only marketing what they do) which doesn't rely on purely black/white lists and doesn't need constant updates in order to be useful. This key difference between legacy and next gen is crucial to understand, the absolute complete reliance on updated lists will never allow legacy products to detect an unknown threat. Sentinel One solution was able to detect and stop completely new and never seen before malwares multiple times, something Cortex or Falcon are simply not designed for and unable to do right now.

TLDR

PANW is ass and most likely CRWD is at the same level if not even worse. The big corps are regarded enough to not care about something as important as security until shit happens and then they can simply blame their security vendor. Their competitor S is not recognized enough yet because switching is expensive, their product is relatively young compared to CRWD or PANW and it takes years to gain credibility and the respect of the industry. Sentinel one product is simply superior and they have been the first to develop this kind of solution which is slowly reaching maturity. 

My position is only shares and no options because it's hard to tell how and when the industry will recognize them as the new leaders:

You can make fun of me being down now but I don't care because I am convinced they will lead the industry in the coming years. Right now they are a pretty good buy but as always, this is not financial advice and do your own research.",2024-09-09,10,71

In the past few days there has been an intense sell off leading to some names being down 4-8%. I’ve seen this over the past few years where this sector underperforms for a period of time before roaring upwards for 6-12 months. I think now is a decent time to layer into shares. PANW is my usual accumulate on down cycles play but I also really like Okta at the moment. It’s forward PE and P/S are ultra competitive in this sector and I also like the fact that they had a really nice beat and raise quarter last earnings report yet are still down 6% from that pre earnings price. I plan on buying both but would love to hear the pros and cons of these two companies or the sector as a whole. For you ultra value investor fanboys yes I know the PE of cybersecurity as a whole is high but it’s PEG is still much better than many tech favorites and it trades at a premium knowing cybersecurity continues to be ultra stable and something every major company must spend on.

NO Position yet thus flair: discussion. **TDLR:** Puts on ZS, 200P or below

**Hypothesis:** Palo Alto Networks (PANW) dropped nearly 30% last week after reporting earnings. PANW, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, Sentinel One have been beating on earnings and revenue for last several quarters. PANW Guidance was negative: less demand in government, overall market spending fatigue, and strategic shift for them causing short-term uncertainty (ChatGPT has the detail summary below from [earnings call script](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/02/20/palo-alto-networks-panw-q2-2024-earnings-call-tran/)).  It's recovered a bit thanks to Pelosi & other money buying the dip. This might be a sign other cybersecurity industry may be reducing guidance overall. PANW makes hardware in addition to software and are profitable while ZS, CRWD, S, pure software and cloud with no profits.

**The play:** ZS, CRWD reacted but also recovered last week. ZS reporting this week (2/29). I'm thinking possible repeat. ZS@242 currenlty. Maybe 20% drop so 200P or below could be good.  If ZS drops then CRWD, and S would drop. S did drop hard same time last year. Current prices of this week's PUTS below. Earnings still some days away so they can still depreciate. Might be good to lotto some in case ZS dumps hard, should offset IV (155%) some since C/P ratio at 66% (more open interest on calls this week too), not pricing in downward price pressure.

ChatGPT detail summary of why PANW tanked:  
 

It appears that the stock price of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) may have been affected by a combination of factors, including the announcement of their fiscal Q2 2024 earnings. Here's a summary of key points that could have influenced investor sentiment:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Palo Alto Networks reported robust growth, with revenues growing 19% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating margins expanding by nearly 600 basis points, and a 39% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This indicates a strong financial performance, which is typically positive for stock prices.
2. **Investment in Growth and Innovation**: The company highlighted substantial investments in their three platforms - network security, Prisma Cloud, and Cortex - and achievements like continued ARR growth in their SASE business and leadership in cloud workload security. While investment in growth is essential, it can sometimes concern investors about the short-term impact on profitability.
3. **Softness in US Federal Government Market**: The company noted a significant shortfall in their US Federal government business, attributing it to deals that did not close as expected. This situation, anticipated to continue into Q3 and Q4, could be a potential reason for concern among investors, impacting the stock negatively.
4. **Guidance and Strategic Shifts**: Palo Alto Networks provided guidance for Q3 and the fiscal year, indicating expected growth. However, they also discussed a strategic shift towards accelerating platformization and consolidation, aiming for a $15 billion ARR by 2030. While ambitious, strategic shifts can lead to uncertainty among investors, affecting stock price.
5. **Platformization and Consolidation Strategy**: The company is focusing on a platformization strategy, emphasizing reducing execution risk for customers by offering extended rollout periods and aiming for larger, long-term contracts. This approach, while potentially beneficial in the long term, might have led to concerns about short-term financial impacts, especially regarding billings and revenue growth.
6. **Demand and Spending Fatigue**: Despite strong demand, the company mentioned that customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity, seeking better ROI and total cost of ownership. This acknowledgment might raise concerns about future sales growth and the competitive environment.
7. **AI and Future Growth Opportunities**: The company is optimistic about leveraging AI for future growth, identifying it as a significant opportunity. While this could be seen as positive, it also adds a layer of execution risk and investment that might concern investors focused on short-term returns.

In summary, while Palo Alto Networks demonstrated strong financial performance and has a clear vision for future growth, concerns about the US Federal government market, the impact of strategic shifts on short-term financial metrics, and broader market conditions could have contributed to the stock price movement. Investors might be weighing the balance between short-term uncertainties and the potential for long-term growth and market leadership.",2024-02-27,14,28

**PANW** (earnings on 2/20)

Implied move before earnings: 10%

Stock price change after earnings: -28%

Biggest increase in put price across all the strike prices at the peak (expires 2/23): **75000%**

Implied move before earnings: 7%

Stock price change after earnings: -28%

Biggest increase in put price across all the strike prices at the peak (expires 2/23): **760%**



As you can see, both stock dropped by about 28%, but PANW (although having a higher implied move) put prices went up significantly higher than RIVN's.

Early RTH action provides strong vol, high large-trade rate, and pretty clear upward sentiment. Price then retests VWAP twice, with the second attempt being rather strong and with several large prints. After this rejection of mean reversion through VWAP, price tightens up as it pushing up toward nHOD. Once key 243 is broken with clean conviction after the tight consolidation below it, I go long, filling at 244.090, risking 1.10 R against 243.00, and targeting 250.35. The market expresses some genuine strength after my entry, but soon collapses back through my stop, filling me at 242.983. This just adds to a frustrating few weeks. Happy with the clean execution and setup selection!

PANW opens normally, but the flush down into fresh price territory on high vol lands it on my watchlist. VWAP rejects price three times before the market really looks to the downside with conviction. On the session, volume is elevated, price action is clean and dense, and the structure is very interpretable. Once price starts curling toward LOD, I go short, filling at 241.101, risking against 242.15, right at failed support, and targeting 237.9, a roughly symmetric leg lower. Feeling discomfort at the lack of clean follow-through, I aggressively lower my stop, and then prematurely close the trade early at 240.732, as price starts curling upward. I consider the lowered stop and the early exit both errors - they were fear-based decisions. Would have walked away with +3.05 R, but managed poorly, landing me at +0.35 R.

10sjnyx_PANW,PANW,Is Palo Alto Networks a Rising Star?,"Morningstar, and apparently other financial analysts, are touting the growth potential of Palo Alto Networks: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/02/history-nasdaq-2023-stock-split-stock-wall-street/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/02/history-nasdaq-2023-stock-split-stock-wall-street/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

Oddly, a large part of their argument is that their 3:1 made the stock much more accessible to retail inventors. That's not a particularly powerful driver for future growth of earnings for the company, so I think their opinion is oddly skewed from the start. Nor is the fact that a bunch of analysts are bullish necessarily a great indicator as analysts have their reasons to support a stock (this has been discussed many times before).

So, is PANW a good investment? Quite possibly. As noted in the Morningstar article, they are boasting an impressive growth rate. Gross profit is also growing, but net earnings are still negative. Currently the stock is trading above 50-day average - right around it's 200-day average. My take: worth watching, but not a buy at today's price.",2023-02-03,24,16

* The company also declared a 3-for-1 stock split and expanded its stock repurchase program by $915 million, increasing the total current authorization to $1 billion. The stock will begin trading on a post-split basis on Sept. 14.

* For its fiscal fourth quarter, ended July 31, Palo Alto posted revenue of $1.6 billion, up 27% from the year-ago quarter, and ahead of the company’s guidance range of $1.53 billion to $1.56 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $2.39 a share, likewise above the forecast range of $2.26 to $2.29 a share. 

* Billings were up 44%, to $2.7 billion. Remaining performance obligations were up 40% to $8.2 billion. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned $3.3 million, or 3 cents a share.

We don't talk much about PANW here, so was hoping to get some discussion going:

* If you work in tech or in the cybersecurity industry, what is your take on their future?
* Who are their major competitors and is PANW ""best in class""?
* Does the split make it more likely for you to keep track of this stock?
* What is your best bear/bull case for this stock?

qpri9s_ZS,ZS,A couple of pairs worth watching [AMAT/SNPS; PANW/CRWD/ZS],"One of the things I love watching for is trades within sectors that I know somewhat, where one or two businesses report earnings, followed (over a period of one or more trading days) by other businesses in the same sector. On earnings, stocks in the same sector tend to all fall or rise together (e.g., UBER, LYFT) absent some sort of significant differentiating factor that comes in during the earnings report or in the guidance, unless there are clear signs that market share is definitely being taken away from one player to the benefit of another (e.g., AMD, INTC). 

Take Lyft and Uber. Lyft reports before Uber, generally, so a positive report and guidance for Lyft (which is much smaller, lacking a global footprint and certain businesses Uber has) generally results in Uber shares rising the day after Lyft reports (assuming, of course, that Lyft rises as a result of the positive report and guidance). The same generally occurs when Lyft stock drops on account of a negative report and/or guidance- Uber drops, unless people are counting heavily on different business lines shoring up Uber's balance sheet and earnings for some reason. Occasionally you might get some decoupling because, for example, a pandemic forces large international markets into lockdown while the U.S. remains open, but, for the most part, the pattern holds. (Just don't expect to hold Uber up to and past its earnings date based solely on how LYFT did!)  


By contrast, an earnings report and guidance that lifts AMD does not always lift Intel. AMD and Intel's offerings come about as close to direct substitutes as one can get; in the PC and server markets, we basically have a duopoly.

So let's take those out of the picture, shall we?

Applied Materials reports next week. I am long AMAT (LEAPS long) because I believe there's a secular trend of increasing CapEx for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (built by the likes of AMAT) that is supported by the massive supply chain shortage plus the movement of manufacturing facilities out of countries like China, plus the metaverse, obviously. (The last factor is more psychological than anything at the moment, but it's clearly material to investors who pumped up every semiconductor manufacturer in the universe last week.) What I am not inclined to do is to gamble on AMAT earnings at this point, as the date is too close, and 90 percent of the run-up has already occurred, which leaves me to (more likely than not) be IV crushed. Plus, there are some significant negative catalysts standing between today and the earnings date. But there is a higher margin business in the same sector as AMAT that reports much later.

Synopsys owns a lot of IP in the semiconductor space, and does silicon design and verification work, silicon manufacturing design, and software security assessment/validation work. In short, SNPS does all the things one would need in an environment where AMAT and all of the other semiconductor manufacturers prosper. Good guidance and earnings reports in the coming days from the likes of AMAT and NVDA should prove a boost to SNPS stock in the days following earnings reports for AMAT and NVDA; bad news should have the opposite effect. For the reasons I state above, once I complete my own DD I am likely to run with SNPS longs that I hold through earnings (SNPS reports in December). 

&#x200B;

The same goes for the cybersecurity space, where Palo Alto Networks reports the week of 11/18, followed in a couple of weeks' time by Crowdstrike and ZScaler, which are all pure-play cybersecurity stocks. 

The point is to own/short the later-reporting stock (or options in the underlying) next week so that you benefit from the sympathetic rise/fall that occurs when the earlier-reporting company reports its earnings and guidance next week. Don't bother acquiring them this week because retail starts reporting next week and that's liable to tank everything as the numbers and guidance will be depressing from all but the most well-prepared retailers. 

Additionally, you probably don't want to own a whole lot of anything (longs) past November 9, either. Why? Inflation numbers for October get reported on 11/10 before open, and if they are anything but low AF, stocks likely will see a shock as a result. At a minimum, give it a few days before jumping back in.

P.S. If the AMAT/SNPS interplay appeals to you, NVDA's earnings report and guidance are worth watching for a similar sympathetic change. NVDA reports 11/17, the day before AMAT on 11/18. Any indication that NVDA is ramping up production, getting additional contracts for metashit, or is less dependent on cryptominers than it is on gamers will all benefit NVDA and (to a lesser extent) will pump up AMAT. But again, I think the odds of the market tanking (not a correction, but enough to cost you serious money if you are highly leveraged) after the 11/10/2021 October inflation report and/or depressing reports/guidance from retail are high enough that you should wait until closer to NVDA's earnings date to try this out.",2021-11-09,11,8

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by about 0.5%, inside the 0.7% expected move options were pricing. However, the market was lower mid-week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $444 that corresponds to about **$439** as a *bearish expected move* and **$448** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was above 23 during the week, but closed around 18.50 on Friday following the market rally that ended the week. That is about in line with its historical average. The futures curve is upward sloping with December VIX futures around 23, up from 22 last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

The market ETFs are all pricing larger moves this week than last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **2.1%**
* DIA **1.3%**

### In the News

The market’s move lower last week saw some demand for option volatility as the VIX quickly spiked towards the mid 20s. With the VIX now back in the teens and VIX December futures near 23, options are pricing about a 7% move by year end.

A Debit Put Spread to that level, buying the at-the-money 443 puts and selling a put at the Bearish Expected Move of 413 costs about 8.00 and breaks-even at about 435. It costs about 1.8% of the underlying but protects against about 5% of the 7% move options are currently pricing. For those looking for portfolio protection, those ratios and breakevens are one way to analyze potential hedges:

I was thinking of adding PANW. I read that it's a solid company and has some upside left.

I'm gonna keep my CRWD but not sure about FTNT.

ie6a11_PANW,PANW,Fortinet (FTNT) vs Palo Alto Networks (PANW),"Both companies have been around for quite some time and experienced solid sustainable growth over the past 5 years. Both stocks trade at a similar multiple and offer similar products. However, based on the latest analysts reports, going forward all of them are bullish on Palo Alto and bearish on Fortinet. So I’m trying to understand the logic behind their reports. Fortinet has a strong liquidity position, low leverage, constantly expanding clients list, good management, always wins tons of rewards and gets recognized as a leader in the cybersecurity space.

gmsxwt_PANW,PANW,"Palo Alto Network PANW upgrade details - Daugherty & Co upgrade to Buy, tgt 260","Dougherty & Company upgrades PANW to Buy from Neutral and sets target price at $260. Analyst Catharine Trebnick said, ""We are upgrading Palo Alto Networks to a Buy from Neutral and establishing a $260 PT as conversations with resellers and CISOs suggest product revenues have re-accelerated coming off two quarters of consecutive weakness. Conversations suggest the company benefited from product refresh as organizations set up new VPN connections to enable remote working. Investors have been focused on product growth the last few quarters due to poor execution. The vast majority of our checks were positive on the quarter and suggested improved demand and solid pipeline headed into FQ4. We are expecting management will guide revenues roughly in line with the Street consensus of +14%. The company will report Q3'20 results after the close on Thursday, May 21st.""",2020-05-19,6,30

av86uw_PANW,PANW,Thoughts on Palo Alto Networks (PANW)? Consolidation in cyber security seems overdue.,"New CEO seems to have solid momentum, the company is nearing profitability, continued 30% y/y growth. I’ve been waiting for them to cool off as they are incredible volatile but they seem to be on an upward trajectory and are fighting through the cyber security downturn. 

Posted results today that were very impressive and the market seems to be happy (+9%). Does anyone have any thoughts on why or why not invest for the near term (6-18 months)?

Trading at 22x book value and 116x free-cash flow is crazy high, and it's sales yield of 6.48% is in the lowest 5% of the market. With grossly negative ROA (-21.7%) and ROE (-65.5%), it's no wonder insiders have reduced their ownership by 16% in the last 6 months. Is anyone holding on to this for the long-term, or are traders buying in hoping the trend continues and they can get out before the coming downfall?",2015-03-11,9,1
2ypi99_PANW,PANW,Palo Alto Networks ($PANW): Overpriced and bloated,"Even though Palo Alto Networks are rapidly growing revenue (+50% YoY revenue growth), their sales yield remains weak at 6.48% (for perspective, the average in the market hovers around 50%), they trade at an inflated 22.3 times book value and 116 times free cash flow. Weak ROA -21.7% and ROE -65.5%, are good indicators of why the short float sits at 4.72%. With insiders selling off 16% of their stake in the company over the last 6 months, it appears that even management recognizes that this price is unsustainable. The only thing that this company has going for it is the hype that's caused the stock to rise 77% over the last 12 months and 53% over the last 6. Advise to stay away, but would love to hear a counter argument.",2015-03-11,0,7
1gqx5o_PANW,PANW,Opinions on PANW?,"I've been following PANW for a little while now and I'm having trouble figuring out if their at a good price right now. They had a big run up following their IPO followed by a pretty sharp correction following higher than expected expenses, most of which were sales and marketing. Their currently being sued by Juniper networks for IP. Analysts' price targets range between $50 and $70. They reached their lowest point a couple of days ago and seem to be holding steady through the tech slide since that time.

A key difficulty for me is identifying who their most direct competitors are. They claim that their next generation firewalls are special enough that they aren't worth comparing with IPS and IDS systems but in terms of features and performance Checkpoint, Fortinet, and Sourcefire all seem to have comparable products.",2013-06-20,1,1
