1ishu2q_DIS,DIS,$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential,"**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.

 

**Fundamentals:**

The fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.

Paramount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.

To further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable’s viewership “decreasing”, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**

 

Honestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:

*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat

*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B

*Price to Book Ratio:* .43

*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)

*EV / EBITDA:* \~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \~10x)

The debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:

*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)

*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)

*Quick ratio:* 1.10

*Net margin:* \-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)

QoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020

Free cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM

*Cash on hand:* $2.44B

Skydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed

There are deep value stocks, then there are…….. you know the rest.

 

 

**Technicals:**

Getting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don’t you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.

There are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.

Please note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post

 

*Monthly*

https://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07

Macro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)

Macro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)

RSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024

MACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024

Lastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it’s been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it’s been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.

 

*Weekly*

  

https://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68

The consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5 *exactly* confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.

The weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.

MACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this *will* change. Reversal in trend *is* imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.

 

https://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635

The Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57

And how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.

 

*Daily*

https://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11

There are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it’s more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \~ $20b market cap?

There are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \~$19-$23, \~$34.50-$36, and \~$85-$91.25.

https://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7

 The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.

 

To summarize how bullish the technicals are:

1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control
2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD
3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD
4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run
5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook
6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range
7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11

 

**Some fun stuff:**

Short interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount’s competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price ""ceiling"" could be shattered.

 

*Final point:* \*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.

 

**Tldr;**

Paramount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation—its P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \~5x, and it’s generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\~12+ days to cover), and I’ve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades—if that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.

1fiadft_PARA,PARA,Is Paramount the quintessential value play?,"Back in july paramount announced its acquisition deal with Skydance Media, the private equity firm of Larry Elison’s son. At first $PARA.B shares traded up 20% as the buyout price was $15 per share it has since shrunk down. Now that the shopping window has closed this deal is in the hands of the FTC. 

This FTC administration has been notoriously hard on business so there is definitely some risk of this being blocked. I guess the question is what are the odds? 

If the deal goes through we know the shares have 50% upside and if it doesn’t paramount likely goes bankrupt and only little equity will be salvaged after a long proceedings. This is kinda similar to the Activision buyout Buffet was heavily invested in but Activision had much less downside risk if it blocked.

1engz63_PARA,PARA,Paramount Global reports streaming profit for first time ever as shares rise ,"Paramount Global is cutting 15% of its U.S. workforce, part of a broader cost-cutting plan as it prepares for a merger with Skydance Media.

Paramount has identified $500 million in cost savings, which include the head count reductions, as part of $2 billion in synergies related to its transaction with Skydance. The job cuts will affect the company’s marketing and communications department, as well as employees who work in finance, legal, technology, and other support functions, the company said during its earnings conference call Thursday.

Paramount agreed to a merger with Skydance Media last month. That deal includes a 45-day go-shop period — in which a special committee of Paramount’s board could find another buyer — that concludes later this month.

Earnings surged as the company’s streaming division swung to an unexpected profit — the first time Paramount has announced a profitable quarter for its direct-to-consumer business.

Shares climbed more than 5% in after-hours trading Thursday.

Here’s how Paramount performed in the quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. 12 cents expected

Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $7.21 billion expected
Revenue falls

Second-quarter revenue dropped 11% and missed analyst estimates as licensing, TV advertising and cable subscription sales dropped.

The revenue drop was the largest miss compared to analyst estimates since February 2020, according to LSEG data. Paramount attributed the miss to a decline in TV licensing revenue, which can be difficult for analysts to model given their start and end dates.

Paramount+ revenue grew 46% on year-over-year subscriber growth and higher prices. Paramount+ customers decreased 2.8 million from last quarter to 68 million as the company unwound a Korean partnership deal with entertainment company CJ ENM’s Tving streaming platform.

Paramount’s streaming division turned a profit for the quarter of $26 million after losing $424 million a year ago. Analysts had estimated a loss of $265 million this quarter.

Paramount reaffirmed it’s on track to reach U.S. profitability for Paramount+ in 2025. The streaming service has raised prices and cut content spend.

Paramount’s quarterly profit is helped by not having an NFL licensing charge for the period, which will kick in later in the year.

Shares have slumped 31% so far this year amid declines among cable subscribers and a soft linear TV advertising market.

Paramount also took a $6 billion one-time impairment charge associated with the decline in its cable networks. It comes on the heels of a $9.1 billion write-down from peer Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday.

The company had to take the charge as an adjustment forced by its transaction with Skydance.

1dtbq74_PARA,PARA,"Paramount hunts for a streaming partner, could kick off a wave of deals ","Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney’s suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn’t escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company’s co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

“What they don’t have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,” McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global’s balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn’t been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn’t be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery’s direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast’s NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn’t progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

“The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,” McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. “Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.”  

Spokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.

Streaming 2.0

Since late 2019, traditional media companies including Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have all launched streaming services that have hemorrhaged billions of dollars in losses.

There’s long been consensus in the industry that there are too many streaming services relative to the number of total paying customers. Many executives have speculated that just four or five global services can likely survive and flourish. The others would need to be consolidated or folded into existing platforms.

“There may be some combination of Paramount, Peacock and Max,” said Peter Chernin, former CEO and chairman of Fox Group, in an interview with CNBC last year.

If Paramount reaches an agreement on a joint venture with either Max or Peacock, there would be added pressure on whichever service is left out to do a deal of its own.

Media companies are now focused on better monetizing streaming content through bundles and partnerships. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently become more willing to license some of their content to rival streaming services, such as Netflix, to better monetize shows that aren’t adding a lot of new subscribers to their streaming services.

Comcast recently introduced a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for its cable, broadband and mobile customers for $15 a month.

Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they plan to bundle their streaming services beginning in the summer. While the companies haven’t yet announced a price for the package, which will include Disney+, Hulu and Max, the discount will be “significant,” according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Better windowing

Another hot topic of current discussions revolve around windowing movies and TV series through different streaming services at different price points.

This idea was something considered by Skydance Media, which nearly acquired Paramount Global before talks broke down last month.

Skydance’s plan for Paramount included merging Paramount+ with another streamer to create new streaming services which would better rationalize the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.

For example, Paramount’s Showtime library could be combined with another company’s prestige dramas to create a stand-alone ad-free service.

A different ad-supported service could then contain live sports and windowed prestige originals, which could appear on the second service after a certain amount of time. The services could be bundled together, such as how Disney bundles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

A representative for Skydance declined to comment.

One app experience

There’s a widespread shared sentiment among traditional media leadership that better packaging of existing content can be more lucrative for the entire industry.

The downside to more bundling or windowing of content is customer confusion. Increased mix-and-match offers between streaming services can easily lead to customer frustration rather than satisfaction.

Several media executives said privately they expect Peacock, Paramount+, Max and Disney could ultimately team up their programming within one application to alleviate confusion and compete with Netflix, which dominates the subscription streaming industry with about 270 million global subscribers.

Two executives said Disney would be the most likely company to own the application, given its relative dominant position in the entertainment streaming industry. Any media company who contributed content to the streaming application could share in the revenue, similar to how cable economics work today, they added.

Still, company rivalries and tensions may make such a product difficult to put together. While Max and Disney have struck a bundling deal, Comcast and Disney have long had a strained relationship. The two parties are currently trying to unwind a joint venture — Hulu — to give Disney full control over the service that was initially co-owned by NBCUniversal, Fox and Disney.

1dibh2s_PARA,PARA,Paramount Global closes at all time lows today - thoughts on where it goes from here?,"Paramount (PARA) recently dipped below $10 and closed at a new all time low today. The sell-off continues after a merger with Skydance was called off at the last minute by controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. 

With a market cap with just shy of $7 billion and debt of $14 billion, Paramount Global's enterprise value is now under $20 billion. 

Paramount now trades sharply below recent offers made earlier this year. Sony/Paramount $26 Billion, Byron Allen's $30 billion offer, and even Dave Ellison's $15 tender offer for 50% of shares might be better than how Paramount is doing now. 

The movie studio alone, Paramount Pictures, is likely worth more than the the equity value paramount trades at. Apollo offered $11 billion for Paramount Pictures alone and Amazon bought MGM (a much smaller studio) for $8.5 billion two years ago. 

However, the reason why Paramount trades at such a discount appears to be due to controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. She owns less than 10% of Paramount but has over 70% of voting control through her class A shares (PARAA). [Reports ](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-06-12/shari-redstone-paramount-sale-skydance-deal-collapse-larry-ellison-david-ellison-cbs)says Redstone is reluctant to see the company her father built broken up. 



I think at these prices Paramount is a acquisition play. Likely not now but over a year from now when their turnaround plan sputters out. Debt is large but most of their debt matures after 2027 and is fixed-rate. Thoughts on this play?",2024-06-17,66,64

1bjxn79_PARA,PARA,Paramount Global Stock Pops On Apollo’s Reported $11 Billion Bid For Studio,"Shares of Paramount Global popped in afternoon trade on a report that Apollo Global has made an $11 billion bid for the company’s film and TV studio. The private equity giant has been in and out of the mix of suitors, which also include David Ellison‘s Skydance Media and Byron Allen.

The stock heading into market close is up over 11% at $12.48 in heavier than usual volume. That’s still half of where it was a year ago as the company battles streaming losses and high debt. It’s been a takeover target for months now without any deal.

The WSJ cited people familiar with the situation saying the board is reviewing the Apollo offer. Deadline has heard that Ellison has fielded a bid for the whole company but no details. There’s been speculation out there by some industry sources that Larry Ellison would never back a money-losing proposition such as Paramount. After all, Larry Ellison did clip the wings of Megan Ellison’s Annapurna after it was bleeding. However, that’s a hasty generalization: the Oracle co-founder, we hear, is completely in step with David Ellison, and he’s always about a good deal in the end.
ar’s majority shareholder Shari Redstone hasn’t wanted to pluck out and sell off the studio, its crown jewel.

Skydance Media has offered a deal through Paramount Global’s parent, National Amusements — Redstone’s family holding company —  that controls the media company.

That’s complicated since as minority shareholders, who happen to include Warren Buffett and Mario Gabelli, are antsy about not getting taken out for a premium in a deal, while Shari is. Allen’s offer, for instance, calls for transactions at set prices for Paramount’s voting and non shareholders.

The Bob Bakish-led company has said it will entertain all offers. Meanwhile, its retrenching, including a big round of layoffs recently. It’s also divesting non-core assets, including the sale of Viacom18 to India’s Reliance Group for $517 million.

National Amusements, Paramount and Skydance reps declined to comment. Apollo wasn’t immediately available.

1b2jned_PARA,PARA,"Paramount falls short on revenue but posts profit, strong streaming results","Paramount Global missed revenue expectations for the fourth quarter on Wednesday but posted a surprise quarterly profit and posted strong results from its streaming platform Paramount+.

Here’s how Paramount performed in the fourth quarter compared to Wall Street estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. an expected loss of 1 cent

Revenue: $7.64 billion vs. $7.85 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Paramount reported a profit of $514 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $21 million, or 1 cent per share, the year prior. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share were 4 cents for the period.

Paramount — home to brands such as CBS, Showtime, BET, Nickelodeon and its namesake movie studio — reported a 6% year-over-year revenue decline but posted notable strides in its streaming segment.

Paramount+, its flagship streaming service, reached 67.5 million subscribers during the period, a net increase of 4.1 million, and recorded 69% revenue growth year over year. The company expects to achieve profitability for Paramount+ by 2025, it said Wednesday.

Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew 43%, partially driven by price increases, and revenue across its entire direct-to-consumer segment grew 34%.

Paramount saw a 27% jump in global viewing hours across Paramount+ and Pluto TV during the fourth quarter.

“Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on maximizing the return on our content investments and scaling streaming, while transforming the cost base of our business,” CEO Bob Bakish said in a press release. “And I couldn’t be more thrilled with the early momentum we’ve had across every platform in 2024, demonstrating the power of our strategy and assets.”

Paramount has been exploring sale options for all or parts of its business in recent months as the media landscape rapidly changes. Paramount has struggled without a solid growth narrative, with shares down more than 50% over the past two years.

Warner Bros. Discovery had been in preliminary talks to acquire Paramount, but those talks have since halted, CNBC’s Alex Sherman reported Tuesday.

Paramount announced about 800 layoffs earlier this month, just a day after the company revealed it had reached record viewership numbers for this year’s Super Bowl.

The company on Wednesday reported its TV media revenue declined 12% year over year. Advertising revenue declined 15% due to overall “softness in the global advertising market and 5-percentage point impact from lower political advertising,” according to the earnings release.

Revenue in Paramount’s filmed entertainment sector sank 31% year over year, driven by lower licensing revenue.

***\*Ampere:***

*Ampere Analysis predicts direct-to-consumer streaming businesses of all major U.S. media companies – sans any sports streaming operations – will achieve consistent profitability within 18 months.*

*In analysis released Wednesday, the firm pegs* ***Disney*** *as poised to get there first (as early as calendar Q1 2024) but followed in short order by* ***Warner Bros***. *Discovery (predicted profitability by Q3 2024), with* ***Paramount*** *and* ***NBCUniversal*** *close on others’ heels (both projected to reach the goal by Q1 2025). It should be noted analysis of NBCU only takes into account U.S.-based Peacock streaming operations and not Comcast’s traditional pay TV-led services or Sky Showtime. And taking sports out of the equation is another significant caveat.*

*Disney, in its most recent earnings report grew DTC revenue 12% year over year to $5.04 billion, while narrowing DTC operating losses substantially to $420 million (compared to $1.4 billion DTC losses in the same period a year prior.) Disney’s DTC operations include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. The company in 2023 implemented a broader cost-cutting initiative that included cutting 7,000 jobs globally and put it on track to slash costs by roughly $7.5 billion.*

*“Not only have all the major studio streamers now laid the groundwork for profitability…but they all also look likely to turn streaming direct into significant sources of profit,” wrote Ampere in its report. By 2028, Ampere expects studios will generate between $1 billion and $2 billion in annual EBIT from streaming businesses, based on their current market footprint – with further geographic expansion leading to even greater potential upside.*

*Alongside cost-cutting measures and spending pullbacks Ampere pointed to the embrace of ad-supported products as the second key factor in driving a shift toward profitability. It pegged advertising as a “wild card opportunity” that could generate significantly more growth than currently modeled.*

.................................................................................

***\*LightShed:***

*Analysts at LightShed say “we are even more convinced today than 2018 that legacy media companies are making a mistake and all need to radically alter their streaming strategies.”*

*“All four are laser focused on eliminating streaming losses and shoring up balance sheets rather than growing the most robust and profitable long-term streaming business,” wrote analysts led by Richard Greenfield in a December 19 post.*

*LightShed shared prescriptions for streaming businesses of each media company, some of which it thinks should be shut down altogether – including* ***Peacock***. *The firm noted operating losses for Peacock since launch will come in at more than $7.5 billion at the end of 2023, “with NO obvious path to Peacock ever paying back Comcast’s investment.” LightShed suggested Comcast could shift away from a focus on sports to make Peacock look more like Starz – or possibly merge it with both Starz and Showtime. They also advised the ad-supported version of Peacock could be revamped as a FAST service leaning on NBCU’s TV and film catalog.\**

*For* ***Disney***, *one piece of advice from the firm is to abandon plans for a flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product and move prime ESPN+* *content to a combined Hulu-Disney+ app; “We believe Disney has to pick one streaming business to focus* *ALL of the company’s energy and resources; in turn, Disney should focus their efforts on the streaming platform where they have full control of the IP/content versus licensing sports rights from third-parties,” wrote the analysts*.

*As for* ***Paramount***, *LightShed doesn’t see “how Paramount+ can earn a compelling payback on the billions of dollars that have already been invested” and would scale back the SVOD right away and reverse course on the integration of Showtime, among other steps. Ultimately the firm expects Paramount will be sold.*

*LightShed also doesn’t have a rosy view of* ***Warner Bros***; *“With the accelerating collapse of linear TV, we simply do not believe Warner Bros. Discovery has the ability to become a leading global streaming competitor with enough scale to drive profitable growth,” the firm stated*.

*The analysts said WBD should rebrand the Max SVOD service as HBO and get rid of content that doesn’t fit the brand (meaning newly integrated assets such as Discovery content and CNN), while keeping Discovery+ as a standalone niche streaming service.*

*Finally, the firm doesn’t see M&A as the answer to media companies’ streaming struggles, as LightShed said it’s too late and companies are “not equipped talent-wise or strategy-wise” to build global streaming services on top of linear TV businesses facing growing headwinds. It also sees regulatory approval as a challenge:*

“*Legacy media companies simply do not have time to wait and hope for M&A as a strategy,” wrote Greenfield. “They must take action to alter their streaming strategies immediately or their stocks will continue to suffer*.”

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish on Tuesday in New York City to discuss a possible merger, Axios has learned from multiple sources. Why it matters: The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation.

- Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount's parent company, about a deal.

- WBD's market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount's was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals.

Details: The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount's headquarters in Times Square.

- The duo discussed ways their companies could compliment one another. For example, each company's main streaming service — Paramount+ and Max — could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+.

- It's unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table.

- WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.

Between the lines: The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount's franchises, while Paramount's children's programing assets could be essential to WBD's long-term streaming ambitions.

- CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS' crime dramas, such as ""NCIS"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV.

- CBS Sports' footprint could be combined with WBD's. For example, CBS and WBD's Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.

„Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet was even more bullish on the benefits of a break-up, estimating Paramount’s equity could be worth around $38 per share if the firm’s networks, production assets and Direct to Consumer (DTC) business were sold individually. The bank’s sum-of-the-parts analysis values Paramount at roughly $38.8 billion, with its cable networks at roughly $7.4 billion, its broadcasting business at roughly $12.1 billion, its production assets at roughly $18 billion and its DTC business at $6.8 billion.“

- Golden parachutes for CFO/CEO agreed in November

https://ir.paramount.com/node/69411/html#para_ex10x2-111623.htm

- Redstone ie controlling interest is not denying talks

“Puck earlier reported that Ms. Redstone and Skydance were in talks. Spokespeople for National Amusements, Ms. Redstone and Skydance declined to comment.” - NYT

- Skydance is linked with AAPL and PARA, AAPL with BRK as AAPL is one of their biggest holdings 

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/david-ellison-skydance-apple-films-1235078773/amp/

- Management is anyway selling off non-core assets and restructuring business which shows the right thinking

- BRK is largest shareholder and has a 15% stake

- Warren and Munger (rip) have been very clear that they think streaming is a lousy business so may be speaking with Redstone about the BRK view - BRK may be persuasive but if not there are other possibilities (heads I win, tails I win)

- In a no-deal scenario DTC (streaming) business may go profitable in 2024, but in worse case they can just close it all down and return PARA to profit. In summary the potential financial distress is isolated to DTC business therefore can be undone if it doesn’t show results, and add around $2bn in profit.

- That said Nasdaq has 2026 EPS consensus forecast of $2.7 which suggests a $30 valuation is possible in 2 years 

- There’s good reason this is possible and losses will reduce next year. Current DTC losses can be narrowed according to CFO and revenues have jumped massively with forward guidance of 9bn in revenue in 2024, 6+bn spend (read 7bn). Showtime combination will cut out nearly 1 bn of costs. The company introduced Paramount+ With Showtime as the name of its ad-free streaming package this summer and said it would phase out the standalone Showtime streaming app around the end of 2023 and rebrand the cable network.

“Chopra noted that subscribers of the current Paramount+ with Showtime bundle have spent 20% more time and consume 40% more titles on the service and that churn from the bundle is “significantly lower” than from standalone Paramount+. The combination is expected to generate $700 million of future expense savings.”

- The CFO is open to consolidation which maximises shareholder value so another voice in the wheel house saying the right things at least

“It’s probably unwise to bet against consolidation in the media industry or really any industry for that matter. Given that, we try to remain very open minded and thoughtful about what those consolidation opportunities may be.” Chopra said during Gabelli Funds’ 15th annual Media & Entertainment Symposium on Thursday. “Whether Paramount is a seller of assets into consolidation or whether we are a consolidator of assets, we’ll have to see. But, as I said, we remain very open minded to those possibilities because they can be very effective ways of maximizing shareholder value.”

https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-consolidation-opportunities-naveen-chopra/

- Forbes echo my analysis and point out a potential competitive advantage

“We think that Paramount’s earnings have considerable potential to increase in the coming years, given the long-term monetization prospects of the streaming business. For perspective, the company is projecting a 20% uptick in average revenue per user for Paramount+ in 2024. Paramount previously raised its 2024 direct-to-consumer revenue target from $6 billion to $9 billion. Moreover, Paramount can monetize its new content investments via a mix of television, theatricals, and streaming, helping it to boost its returns compared to players such as NetflixNFLX which are purely streaming-focused. Paramount stock trades at just about 11x projected 2024 earnings (which are being depressed by the current streaming spending) which is attractive, in our view. This is well below the likes of Netflix, which trades at over 26x 2024 earnings. We value Paramount stock at about $24 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price.”

CEO has 80% approval rating on Glassdoor

Insider activity good

https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/813828.htm

- One possibility is Paramount face a downgrade next year to below BBB, which could force more asset sales - the worst case scenario from my perspective is a rights issue but that would probably sink the ship, don’t see that being the best move for shareholders but haven’t fully discounted this possibility yet.

„So, when we’re going to look at this company next year and make a [rating] assessment, one of the things that’s clear is, they’ve got to start generating free cash flow. They also have to show a path toward break-even with their streaming business.”

DYOR

Edit: Recently I‘ve been looking at what movies they own (Titanic, Braveheart, Forest Gump, Top Gun, Catch Me If You Can, The Godfather, Interstellar, Iron Man, Star Trek, Terminator, Hunt for Red October, Zodiac, to name just a few https://www.paramountpictures.com/theatrical-library) and what they’re releasing next year (eg Gladiator 2), they’re a sleeping giant. If they can advertise Paramount+ when they release their own movies and also leverage Super Bowl there’s a massive potential to grow subs and destroy the competition. Apple‘s content cannot compete with that on any spend - AAPL are fundamentally incapable of generating anything other than average left leaning sanitised content due its safety aspect and lack of management focus. Amazon made a killer move acquiring MGM.

Edit edit: National Amusements owns roughly 32M Class B (non-voting) shares and 31.5M Class A (voting) shares. They accumulated USD 250m of debt (credit facility) during the pandemic, now issued preferred stock to raise USD 125m to pay that off and release Class B stock used as collateral. The warrants are for 3.5M of National Amusements’ Class B at a strike price of $15, so existing shareholders don’t get diluted. Excellent write-up here. In summary, National Amusements finance is probably better than we think and some shorts might disappear if the collateral was hedged when the credit facility was taken out. The credit facility agreement extends through 2025.

The annual dividend is $5.75 which over 20% annual yield on the preferred.

I think IF the preferred dividends are stopped they still continue to be earned so you would get paid eventually on those dividends unless the company went BK. Or if it never pays another dividend.

I thought preferred shares had some sort of buy out price. But only thing I could find was something called liquidation preference for $100. 

I am not saying this is sure thing. Far from it. Just the dividend income is so high. Is it a value trap? Maybe, Paramount should be acquired. That seems like the only way for it to create value for current shareholders.

[FULL TRANSCRIPT: BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CHAIRMAN & CEO WARREN BUFFETT SPEAKS WITH CNBC’S BECKY QUICK ON “SQUAWK BOX” TODAY](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/full-transcript-berkshire-hathaway-chairman-ceo-warren-buffett-speaks-with-cnbcs-becky-quick-on-squawk-box-today-.html) 

    BECKY QUICK: Very quickly, can I just ask you about Paramount? That’s another Berkshire investment that’s been a relatively new one. Is it because of streaming? What happened?
    
    WARREN BUFFETT: Streaming that, you know, it’s not really a very good business. And, you know, it the people in entertainment that make lots of money, the shareholders really haven’t done that great over time. And supplied the money, it’s a glamorous business. And I had some friends in Hollywood, you know? And they look for -- and they find ’em. I mean, it’s like it attracts people. And—
    
    BECKY QUICK: You mean suckers?
    
    WARREN BUFFETT: It’s a great way to meet girls for all I know. Well no, I mean, but the is it fundamentally that good a business, when it was distributing or producing movies or and you’ve got some people that have got deep pockets that aren’t gonna quit. And the product they’re offering people, the chance to watch all those movies, you know, for peanuts and all that. But can they -- we’ll find out. But so far, they haven’t been able to. They’ve been able to attract subscribers, but they attract ’em at a terrible price.
    
    BECKY QUICK: Alright. You gave a whole lotta reasons why not to buy Paramount. Why did you buy it?
    
    WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we’ll see what happens.

Here is Buffett's thinking in a nutshell: ""It's a glamorous business ... you’ve got people with deep pockets.  And the product they’re offering ... the chance to watch all those movies ... for peanuts ... They’ve been able to attract subscribers but ... at a terrible price.""  What he means is the customer acquisition cost is too high for the streaming business as PARA has to compete with better capitalized competitors like Netflix and Disney.  But the streaming industry is full of deep-pocket players who might be eyeing PARA's IP assets.  In other words, PARA is an acquisition play -- just like BH's larger investment, Occidental Petroleum, might be.",2023-04-16,7,8

**Full Story:**

Paramount Global, a media and entertainment conglomerate, announced a major settlement in a shareholder litigation related to CBS's $30 billion merger with Viacom. The settlement, worth $122.5 million, was announced on Friday and came after months of negotiations between the parties involved.

The dispute arose after the 2019 merger of CBS and Viacom, which created one of the largest media companies in the world. Shareholders of CBS accused the company's board of directors of breaching their fiduciary duties by agreeing to a merger with Viacom at an undervalued price. The shareholders also claimed that the board failed to disclose important information about the deal to shareholders.

The lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and named several defendants, including CBS, Viacom, and their respective board members. The plaintiffs sought damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other claims related to the merger.

After months of litigation, Paramount Global, the parent company of both CBS and Viacom, reached a settlement with the plaintiffs. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the settlement is worth $122.5 million and will be paid out to the plaintiffs over a period of time.

In a statement, Paramount Global expressed its satisfaction with the settlement and noted that it would allow the company to move forward with its business operations without the distraction of ongoing litigation. The company also emphasized its commitment to acting in the best interests of its shareholders and stakeholders.

The settlement is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, who had been seeking a larger payout. However, the settlement also represents a major expense for Paramount Global, which will need to pay out a significant amount of money to resolve the lawsuit.

Overall, the settlement highlights the complex legal and financial challenges that can arise in large-scale mergers and acquisitions. While mergers can create significant value for shareholders and companies alike, they can also be fraught with legal and financial risks that must be carefully managed. The settlement also underscores the importance of transparency and disclosure in corporate transactions, as well as the need for companies to act in the best interests of their stakeholders at all times.",2023-03-12,1,0

The fact that Netflix is now profitable — and, more importantly, generating positive free cash flow — wasn’t the only reason for optimism: Netflix had the good fortune of funding its expansion into content production in the most favorable interest rate environment imaginable; Netflix noted in this past quarter’s Letter to Shareholders:

>We don’t have any scheduled debt maturities in FY23 and only $400M of debt maturities in FY24. All of our debt is fixed rate.

That debt totals $14 billion; Warner Bros. Discovery, meanwhile, has $50.4 billion in debt, Disney has $45 billion, Paramount has $15.6 billion, and Comcast, the owner of Peacock, has $90 billion. None of them — again, in contrast to Netflix — are making money on streaming, and cash flow is negative. Moreover, like Blockbuster and renting DVDs from stores, the actual profitable parts of their businesses are shrinking, thanks to the streaming revolution that Netflix pioneered.

Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney are almost certainly pot-committed to streaming, but Warner Bros. Discovery in particular has talked about the importance of profitability, and Disney just brought back Bob Iger after massive streaming losses helped doom his predecessor née successor; it seems likely their competitive threat will decrease, either because of higher prices, less aggressive bidding for content, or both. Meanwhile, it’s still not clear to me why Paramount+ and Peacock exist; perhaps they will not, sooner rather than later.

When and if that happens Netflix will be ready to stream their content, at a price that makes sense for Netflix, and not a penny more.",2023-01-24,56,49

Just coming on to share the mind-bogglingly low valuation of Paramount (PARA). Consider the following:

1.) Paramount possesses the fastest growing streaming offering in the market, Paramount+.

2.) Paramount owns CBS and has the rights to broadcast most NFL games as well as Premier League Soccer.

3.) Paramount Pictures has had a wildly successful year, including the release of Top Gun Maverick, the 5th highest grossing film of all time.

Despite this, PARA shares are trading at an embarrassingly low valuation:

1.) Price/earnings multiple of less than 8.

2.) Approximately one third price/sales.

3.) Less than half of book value.

Paramount is definitely a company in transition, but this valuation dislocation is borderline criminal.

wjpsuw_WBD,WBD,"Am I missing something, or is Paramount extremely undervalued?","Paramount Global (PARA) is my largest non-index position by far, because I’ve concluded that it’s significantly undervalued and being disregarded by the market. Here are some numbers to support my quantitative analysis:

FCF 2018: 1.26B
FCF 2019: 0.88B
FCF 2020: 1.97B
FCF 2021: 0.6B

Assuming the following: 

required rate of return of 10%

average FCF growth rate of 8% which is what we’ve seen recently, and

an average price:FCF ratio of 27.68, which is what I’ve calculated based on market cap:FCF ratios over the past several years,

a discounted cash flow analysis would yield a fair value of $33.77 billion, or $51.96 per share. 

As for the qualitative side of analysis, PARA, formed by a merger of Viacom and CBS, owns broadcasting rights for a variety of sporting events through CBS, many channels including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and BET, the streaming services Pluto TV and Paramount+, as well as Paramount Studios, which has the rights to many hits such as Star Trek, Top Gun, and Yellowstone (which streams on Paramount+ and currently has spin-offs in the works).

The merger between the two sides of the business seems quite sensible, and the broadcasting/film production businesses provide more than enough cash flow to fund the high-growth streaming businesses. In total, Pluto and Paramount+ have 63.7 million subscribers, rivaling Disney+’s 87.6 million. Also notable is the rapid gain in market share: Paramount’s subscribers grew by 1.7 million in Q2, a 10.9% annualized increase. 

Morningstar agrees with my analysis - its fair value estimate is $58 per share with a narrow moat rating.

Is there a qualitative issue here, some problems I’m not seeing on the balance sheet, or just a market distaste for the company/industry? What am I (along with Morningstar) missing that the market sees?

At the time of writing, PARA trades for $25.21, implying a 51.5% discount to fair value if I’m correct.

urhq2m_NFLX,NFLX,Buffet's reason for investing in Paramount Global,"I've just finished reading the 10-Q and 8-K filings for Paramount Global and can't find any crazy reasons why Buffet would want to invest in this company besides the discount to NCAV it offers.

&#x200B;

Looking at some numbers:

NCAVPS: $74.44

Book value: $34.92 (increasing over the past 5 years)

Currently trading at $28.02

Debt/Equity: 0.82

Current ratio: 1.58

ROE is positive and above 15% for at least the past 6 years

&#x200B;

So far the company looks good, however, looking at the Free cash flow:

2015: 1.22B

2022: -717M

&#x200B;

The operating earnings are decreasing since 2018 and they seem to drastically and successfully change towards the subscription model. Their report says they are still #1 in many TV programmes and are capitulating by putting more focus on programming. However, much of this was due to going global with subscriptions. Can they really take much of the pie that's already split between Disney, Netflix and Apple?

&#x200B;

I'm a beginner and only recently started reading 10-Q fillings but I thought I'd jump on the speculation train to hone my investing skills. Please correct me if you see any mistakes.

ur8jsv_PARA,PARA,Warren Buffet Buys More Than %10 of $PARA!!!,"Over the weekend, I [wrote a DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uprewy/the_most_undervalued_stock_in_all_the_market_rn/) making my case as to why I thought Paramount Global was THE most undervalued stock in the markets. Well...looks like I wasn't the only value investor liking PARA.

Berkshire 13F just revealed that Warren Buffet has taken an %11 stake in Paramount! The stock is up about %7 in after hours to almost $30. Looks like Warren was buying at much higher prices (around $37), so my gut tells me he's not done buying and will continue to buy down here. But why?

Everyone knows Buffet/ Berkshire loves them some Apple and is one of the major shareholders there. I now am more positive than ever, that it will be Apple that buys PARA...and this is just a way for Warren to load up on more Apple shares. I will bet my left nut that Warren pushes Apple to do an all share deal and take out Paramount. 

I put my heart and soul into that DD, and some of you clowns said ""puts on PARA"". I told you put your money where your mouth is and show me. I really hope you weren't that foolish.

This reminds of a little story involving Warren that I'll share about the first time I ever bought a stock (Bank of America). Way back right after the Financial Crisis (around 2009), I had heard that it may be the best opportunity to buy stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks back then. But I did my research and felt banks were safe. So I bought Bank of America at $7. Turns out, I didn't nail the bottom and the stock dropped into the $6's. I panic sold. Not too long after, news came out that Warren bought BAC and the stock jumped to $11 within weeks. I felt like an ass...but that was what was needed to establish a bottom. I'm hoping the same thing happens here. This time, I didn't panic sell because of that lesson I learned way back. 

Position: 15k shares at $28.50 (proof posted in the DD). I can sell rn and take my $20k and post some gain porn...but I'm holding on for the Apple buyout.  

Price Target is $65!! 

Cheers!
