1kwxvel_PATH,PATH,The path to profitability is boring but ensures the long run success.,"If you want to level up your trading, trade the major indices, commodities, and bonds. Ignore the news and media and trade the price. 

Execute extreme patience and only enter trades worth taking at the right time with the right size. Dynamic position sizing based on time to expiration, longer expiraries offer more time for management and can carry less risk due to the limited effects of gamma and theta and should be allocated a higher level of capital. 

If a trade goes against you, know exactly when and where you will get out especially when trading options. Understanding how time to expiration and price of the underlying will affect your options price makes this possible. 
Dont be afraid to exit a trade going against you early, you can always get back in and you can avoid the big losses by doing this.

 Dive deep into your emotions and psychology and understand how fear, greed, and fomo can affect objective decision making.

This is what will lead to profitability, or at least a standing chance at it. Its a game of large numbers, consistency, and risk management.

1k537cv_PATH,PATH,Are we on the right path? Any suggestions are highly appreciated.,"Hello,

I would kindly ask for some feedback or a comment on whether my wife and I are on the right path. We are currently in our early thirties and have two children. In our country, it is customary for children to take care of their parents in their later years. However, we would prefer not to follow this tradition ‚Äî instead, we would like to give our children the freedom and time to focus on their own families, while we take care of ourselves and arrange for any necessary support or care.

When we turn 64, we will be entitled to a state pension, which we are contributing to monthly. However, we would also like to have additional savings to ensure we can afford extra care, which is typically provided by family members.

At the moment, we are investing $300‚Äì$500 per month, with 50% going into VUSA (S&P 500) and the remaining 50% split between MSF and ASML.

Would you consider this a relatively safe (as much as stocks can be) and sensible investment? We invest regardless of market fluctuations, as we are not focusing on short-term gains, but solely on the long term.

I would truly appreciate any comments or feedback.

thank you for everything!

¬†**The trade**

This trader placed a $500k outlay on $PATH on very deep OTM options, grossly exceeding OI. This far out, this close to expiry, is highly suggestive of strong conviction a specific direction, in Pelosi-esque style.

[high conviction \/ trader was probably not uncertain](https://preview.redd.it/v0bdf4eemboe1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=69d4bce1ef1e9fbebae5012d956d288ca1c31bff)

**Fact checking myself.**

I stated on the record that [regardless of the outcome I was going to debrief this.](https://x.com/topshotanalytix/status/1899895177923485879) If in the case I was wrong, this would have been a good lesson on how trades like this could be false positives ‚Äì i.e., this could have been a hedge on a massive long position. Also, IV was super high so if this didn‚Äôt move parabolic, IV crush would have wiped a lot of these positions out.

**Having said that, it looks like this played out favorably, for now.**

Earnings are out (conference call still pending), and $PATH is down 20% **so far.** I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen something re-correct by this order of magnitude overnight, so I‚Äôm of the opinion that the upcoming conference call won‚Äôt save the price action here.

Doing the back of the envelope math ‚Äì this trade needs to hit $10.02 to break even. $9.5 would be a relative 2x. $9.30 gives me a 2x. Still too early to call.

1i9bn5e_PATH,PATH,High Time for Change: The Path to Medical Cannabis Integration,"Pathway to Medical Cannabis Integration:

1. FDA Approvals and Rescheduling

Medications like Epidiolex (CBD) and Marinol (THC) show cannabis' therapeutic value, contradicting its Schedule I status.

Pathway: Reschedule cannabis to Schedule II or III to enable broader research, reduce stigma, and pave the way for hospital use.



2. Scientific Evidence

Studies confirm cannabis' efficacy for pain, epilepsy, and nausea, aligning it with other widely prescribed treatments.

Rescheduling would allow clinical trials to expand, ensuring hospitals can adopt cannabis-based therapies.



3. Health Organization Support

The AMA, NIH, and WHO advocate for cannabis reform, citing its medical benefits and potential for integration into healthcare systems.



4. Hospitals and Standardization

Rescheduling enables regulated production, dosage standardization, and hospital-grade cannabis therapies.




Conclusion
Cannabis belongs in hospitals, but this requires federal rescheduling to align science with policy, unlocking its full potential as a modern ""healing potion.""

1i94vsy_PATH,PATH,DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn‚Äôt go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I‚Äôm here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There‚Äôs a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath‚Äôs product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where‚Äôs their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath‚Äôs growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath‚Äôs potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

1huz90i_PATH,PATH,Biotech Momentum Monday: The Path Ahead for $OSTX,"Happy Monday, everyone! Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs in store for (your favorite) OS Therapies ($OSTX) as we kick off the week.

What We Know So Far

* Last week, $OSTX made waves with two major announcements:
* A $6 million capital raise, ensuring they have the resources to advance OST/HER2, their lead immunotherapy for HER2-positive osteosarcoma.
* A partnership with B2i Digital, a move aimed at amplifying their visibility among investors and stakeholders.

While $OSTX has shown promising developments, the chart reveals a bit of a cooling-off period. Support held above $4, which is a strong sign, but the price is still consolidating within an upward channel.

What to Watch This Week:

1. Reclaiming $4.50 The $4.50 level remains a critical pivot. A close above this level early in the week could set the stage for another test of the $5 zone. Watch for buyers stepping in as the stock continues to trade within the channel.
2. Volume Confirmation Volume will be the key metric to validate any price movement. Low volume during consolidation is normal, but a spike in buying volume could signal a breakout attempt above resistance.
3. Catalyst Anticipation Investors will be on the lookout for updates regarding their Phase 2b trial or other clinical milestones. Even whispers of positive progress could generate significant buying interest.

I believe we've all seen the kinds of people that say ""Trading is gambling!"" but the worst part is: these posts I'm talking about had thousands of upvotes, people agreeing left and right, telling the newbies to quit while they still can because trading will ""eat your whole life up and leave you miserable"".

I started swing trading, held stocks for a week or month then sold (I'm from India but I am going to use the USD so that everyone can understand). I had bout $9500 in the broker app and used about 30-50% of the funds and left the rest of it for average if the LTP dropped more than my Average. Made quiet a return from it (I don't really want to calculate how much return it was in %), though I bought myself my very own Honda Motorcycle, my very first Gaming Laptop, Gaming chair and desk, new Air conditioner for my room, Mobile phone for my Dad, paid all the electricity bills throughout the year and groceries for the month (I ain't flexing anything, just want to let you guys know that I bought all of this from my very own profit). 

Then the whole year ended and with the new year I wanted to learn about Intraday trading coz why not? I want funds for my college and for that swing trading isn't enough so I thought let me try Intraday trading. I started off the year with a $118 loss and then recovered it the next week (it was gambling off-course, as I had almost no knowledge about Intraday). Then lost a bit and recovered and then I went a bit deep into what we call as ""Revenge Trading"" and lost about $1700 and then I stopped for 2-3 months coz I was actually scared and started studying the market doing paper trading trying indicators for the first 2 weeks and then gave up on them. 

Then I went on to try all of those fundamental or technical analysis techniques I saw on You tube, Blogs, Articles. And finally after 2.5 months, I read some books, so I can figure out how do I calm myself to stop revenge trading? Made some rules to strictly follow during trading session and absolutely got the calmness. Next step was to conquer the ""Trading part"", for which I watched live sessions of almost all of the people worldwide, saw what they were doing, read some more books, tried some combinations and started using stoploss (I never used it when I lost those $1700, it was basically all scalping rather than actual Intraday trading). 

Now, I'm able to make at least $23 with bout $296 of investment (using leverage) daily and that's just 25% of the funds that I'm using so I can buy more number of stocks in an Intraday session rather than going all in-in just a single stock. Even if I lose, let's say about $30 in 2-3 days , a single trade comes by always (I don't even think now that I want to get back my lost money) and I get an easy stress-free profit of $50+ easily. My question here is: I get a lot demotivated every time whenever I think bout the time I lost those $1700 and there are thoughts that start building in my mind like ""what if I lose"", even though I don't. I don't to hear the comments of people saying to start investing in mutual funds or something (I'm doing that from the profit I get from my Day Trading) nor do I want to hear people saying to stop Trading and all that stuff, I really need some positivity. I want to know if now, what I'm doing is right or not. And how do I overcome that past experience? Thanks.",2024-11-23,0,12
1gwnz46_PATH,PATH,Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I‚Äôll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there‚Äôs no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The¬†**Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as ‚ÄúGMV‚Äù, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use¬†**Gross Merchandise Sales**¬†(‚ÄúGMS‚Äú), which is just a different term.
* The¬†**take-rate**¬†represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson:¬†***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that¬†***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn‚Äôt (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy‚Äôs revenue a decade ago. Now, it‚Äôs down to \~50%.

I‚Äôll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue**¬†(\~73% of total) - These are¬†**required**¬†fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue**¬†(\~27% of total) - These are¬†**optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay‚Äôs take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb**¬†(Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for¬†**$270 million**.
* **Elo 7**¬†(July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the ‚ÄúEtsy of Brazil‚Äù, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for¬†**$212 million**.
* **Depop**¬†(July 12th, 2021)¬†- a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of¬†**$70 million!**¬†No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of¬†**over $1 billion**¬†for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders‚Äô value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers‚Äô base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue**¬†\- Given that the number of active buyers hasn‚Äôt grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin**¬†\- I do think there‚Äôs room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is¬†**$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of¬†**$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

1guykbc_PATH,PATH,The Most Straight Forward DD: Turning the Tide: Cadiz Inc.‚Äôs Path to Sustainable Growth,"Cadiz Inc., a small-cap company in the water infrastructure and sustainability industry, paints a story of resilience amidst prolonged financial challenges. The company, driven by its mission to deliver water solutions, faces significant hurdles that are evident in its financial results over the years.

1. Revenue Growth with Mounting Costs:
   * CDZI has shown a steady increase in revenue, growing from $541,000 in 2020 to $5.5 million in the trailing twelve months (TTM). This growth suggests a rising demand for its services or the company‚Äôs expansion efforts.
   * However, the cost of revenue has consistently outpaced the total revenue, turning gross profit negative for the most recent periods. This indicates that their business operations are currently not sustainable without reducing costs or increasing prices.
2. Operating Expenses Outweighing Revenue:
   * The operating expenses, notably at $21.9 million (TTM), dwarf the revenue, leading to a significant operating loss of $22 million. This reflects either high fixed costs or investments in growth initiatives that have yet to yield results.
3. Debt Burden and Interest Costs:
   * The company carries a heavy debt load, evidenced by high interest expenses of $7.2 million (TTM). This has consistently eroded its earnings and contributed to substantial pretax losses each year.
4. Consistent Net Losses:
   * Net losses have remained substantial, reaching $34.4 million in the TTM. These losses stem from both operating inefficiencies and high interest payments, signaling the need for either external financing or restructuring to sustain operations.
5. Liquidity Constraints and Investment Challenges:
   * While the EBITDA has improved slightly (from deeply negative figures in earlier years), it is still negative at -$20.7 million (TTM). This demonstrates that core operations are not yet cash-flow positive, limiting the company's ability to reinvest in growth without external funding.
6. Shareholder Impacts:
   * With diluted EPS consistently in negative territory (-$0.51 in the TTM), shareholders have seen no return on their investments. The rising number of average shares outstanding (67.4 million TTM vs. 34.2 million in 2020) also indicates potential equity dilution as the company raises funds to sustain operations.

Key Challenges and Opportunities:

The financial data tells the story of a company under significant financial strain but with the potential for growth if it can address its inefficiencies. Here are the challenges and opportunities:

* Challenges:
   * High operating expenses and interest costs overshadow revenue growth.
   * Persistent losses hinder reinvestment capabilities and strain investor confidence.
* Opportunities:
   * Revenue growth indicates market demand, providing a foundation for the company to build on.
   * If cost structures are optimized or new financing mechanisms are secured, CDZI could turn its operations profitable.

The Road Ahead:

For CDZI to thrive, it must tackle its cost inefficiencies and debt burden head-on. Strategic partnerships, operational streamlining, or diversifying revenue streams could aid in stabilizing finances. As of now, the company‚Äôs story remains one of perseverance in the face of adversity, with its future hinging on strategic decision-making and effective execution.

1ddovgf_PATH,PATH,$PATH The Foundation for a Bullish Future,"
I‚Äôve been in the industry for a while now, and I can confidently say that UiPath ($PATH) is one of the most promising companies in the automation space. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm extremely bullish on their foundation, and why I‚Äôm buying in at all-time lows:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**:
   UiPath has shown consistent financial growth. According to a recent article by The Motley Fool, ""UiPath reported revenues of $243.4 million in Q1 2024, a 21% year-over-year increase, showcasing their strong market presence and growth potential"" ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/01/why-uipath-stock-skyrocketed/)). This kind of performance in the current market speaks volumes about their stability and potential for future gains.

2. **Industry Leadership**:
   UiPath is recognized as a leader in the automation industry. Forbes recently highlighted that ""UiPath's innovative approach to automation and their ability to integrate AI into their RPA solutions positions them ahead of the competition"" ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/05/20/uipath-the-future-of-automation/)). Their continuous innovation ensures they remain at the forefront of the industry.

3. **Strategic Partnerships**:
   The company has formed strategic partnerships that strengthen its market position. According to a TechCrunch article, ""UiPath‚Äôs recent collaboration with Microsoft to integrate their automation solutions with Azure highlights their strategic approach to expanding their ecosystem and driving growth"" ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/uipath-partners-with-microsoft/)). This partnership is set to open new avenues for market penetration and revenue streams.

4. **Robust Customer Base**:
   UiPath boasts a robust and growing customer base. A recent CNBC report mentioned that ""UiPath now serves over 10,000 customers, including many Fortune 500 companies, which underscores their reliability and market trust"" ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/uipath-customer-growth/)). Their ability to attract and retain top-tier clients is a testament to their strong product offering and customer satisfaction.

5. **Market Position and Future Potential**:
   Despite current market fluctuations, I believe UiPath is positioned for significant future gains. As reported by My boy Alpha, ""UiPath‚Äôs current stock price represents an attractive entry point for long-term investors. With their strong foundation and growth strategy, they are set to capitalize on the growing demand for automation"" Buying in at these all-time lows could lead to substantial returns as the market recovers and their strategic initiatives bear fruit.

My Position: currently 4,000 shares AVG $23.07 currently down $40,000 butttttt buying more and we‚Äôre coming back.

TL;DR -- I‚Äôve been in the industry and am extremely bullish on UiPath ($PATH). Strong financials, industry leadership, strategic partnerships, and a robust customer base make it a great buy at all-time lows. NFA.",2024-06-11,12,21

**Element79 (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0)**, a prominent player in the mining industry, is redefining the gold and silver market with its robust portfolio and innovative strategies. With its focus primarily on gold and silver, Element79 stands as a beacon in the mining industry, committed to delivering impressive results while adhering to the highest environmental and social standards. This article sheds light on Element79‚Äôs journey, its flagship projects, recent developments, and future prospects.

**About Element79**

Element79 (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0), a leading figure in the mining industry, has established itself as a pioneer in responsible mining practices. Its commitment to sustainable development and strategic acquisitions highlight Element79‚Äôs dedication to maximizing shareholder value. The company‚Äôs impressive portfolio features two flagship projects, the Lucero Property in Peru and the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada, both of which exhibit significant potential for high-grade operations.

**Lucero Property: The Goldmine in Peru**

Nestled in Arequipa, Peru, the Lucero Property is a high-grade gold and silver mine that stands as one of Element79‚Äôs flagship projects. With a rich history and immense potential for future development, Lucero is a testament to Element79‚Äôs commitment to mining excellence.

Historically, the Lucero mine boasted impressive grades, with an average of 19.0g/t Au Equivalent (Au Eq) during its five years of production ending in 2005. Recent assays from underground workings in March 2023 have further validated the potential for a significant high-grade future operation. These assays yielded up to 11.7 ounces per ton of gold and 247 ounces per ton of silver, indicating a promising future for high-grade operations.

https://preview.redd.it/7m7j7b5ma01d1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=8066bf93510ba5f558fb693359b9bd4e9a9e3a2f

**Additional Assay Results**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0) unveils additional findings from its recent underground and surface sampling efforts at the Lucero property, the cornerstone of its endeavors.

James Tworek, CEO of Element79, underscores the significance of these results: ‚ÄúThis data isn‚Äôt just promising; it‚Äôs pivotal. It forms the bedrock upon which we build our future at Lucero.‚Äù

Out of 97 samples analyzed, 56 returned notable gold grades, with peaks at 8.55 g/t gold and 523 g/t silver, as shown in Table 1. Additionally, high concentrations of base metals were detected, affirming the project‚Äôs richness and reinforcing the Company‚Äôs confidence in its resource potential.

These assay results serve dual purposes for Element79. Firstly, they lay the groundwork for resource development and future mine planning, marking essential milestones in the project‚Äôs evaluation process.

Secondly, this data will steer the Company‚Äôs 2024 drill program, informed by comprehensive 3D modeling of geology and historic mine workings. This approach aims for precision and efficiency, utilizing a wealth of data including historical records dating back to 2005, current geochemistry data, underground mapping, and geophysical surveys.

Tworek emphasizes the significance of this data in guiding future exploration efforts: ‚ÄúIt delineates areas of economic strength and directs our focus for ore extraction, leveraging both past data and current findings.‚Äù

**Maverick Springs Project: A Silver Lining in Nevada**

Another gem in Element79‚Äôs portfolio is the Maverick Springs Project, located in the renowned gold mining district of northeastern Nevada, USA. With its proximity to the prolific Carlin Trend, Maverick Springs presents an exciting opportunity for Element79. The project is a silver-rich sediment/carbonate-hosted deposit, similar to the renowned silver-rich epithermal deposits found in Nevada.

**Elevating Community Relations**

In its ongoing commitment to community engagement, Element79 (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0) orchestrated a strategic meeting with artisanal miners from Lomas Doradas. The goal? To cultivate collaborative ties, ensuring mutual support as the Company embarks on exploration efforts on surface land. Seeking exclusive agreements, Element79 aims for a unified approach to mineral extraction and sales, benefitting both parties.

In a bid to solidify this partnership, Element79 proposed draft contracts. These agreements outline a decade-long surface access arrangement for exploration at the Lucero mine site, reciprocated by granting local miners access to defined locations for their operations. Additionally, Element79 pledges to facilitate optimal market pricing for Lomas Doradas‚Äô ore, ensuring a steady revenue stream for both sides.

In March, Element79‚Äôs swift response to a landslide in Chachas exemplified its dedication to community assistance. The team provided vital support, aiding in the transfer of stranded community members until roads were cleared.

Embracing local traditions, Element79‚Äôs (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0) community relations team joined in a traditional Water Ceremony alongside local authorities and leaders. This culturally rich event, steeped in Chachas tradition, underscores the Company‚Äôs commitment to meaningful engagement and integration.

Throughout the year, Element79‚Äôs engagement in social awareness remains steadfast. Site visits and consultations with annex leaders bolster community support for ongoing exploration efforts. The Company advocates for a progressive approach, aligning with sustainable development goals and community interests.

Element79‚Äôs (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS0) commitment to responsible mining practices, coupled with its robust portfolio, positions it as a leader in the mining industry.

Reasons to buy calls:

- Strong momentum on AI, good history of strong results.
- Good revenue model, product is unique
- Solid earnings, crushed it last November Q3 (made a small profit)
- Growing and loyal customer base.
- Equity buyback of shares couple mil (as of March)

Reasons to buy Puts:

- Cathie Wood sold a large stake as of Feb 7, this year. (LOL I know she's untrustworthy as hell and you can technically inverse her for profit, however, she smartly sold $TWLO before they sold off before their earnings, so it's a mixed bag IMO) 
- Unprofitable for the next 3 years, although that hasn't stopped them from performing well over the last 3 years.
- Unsure guidance this year due to high competition in the sector.

I want to be bullish but above concerns are putting me off. What are your thoughts? Anything I've missed? Am I regarded?

18k5jxm_PATH,PATH,TDM ‚Äì would asset sale be an easier path?,"TDM is Bursa plantation company with a healthcare arm.

  
Professor Bruce Greenwald opined that you can get strategic insights by comparing the asset value (AV) with the earnings power value (EPV) of a company. 

  
In a very competitive environment would have the AV = EPV ie the assets have been well deployed to generate profits. If a company has a strong economic moat, you would expect EPV to be much greater than the AV. If you have a case of the EPV being much smaller than the AV, you have under-utilized assets.

  
In the case of TDM, a Bursa Plantation company, the AV is RM 0.40 per share. But its average earnings over the past decade was negative. The EPV can be thought of as zero.

  
This is clearly as case of under-utilised assets. Many would hold the Board and management accountable. Maybe the company should take a leaf from the sale of Boustead Plantation where the Revised Asset Value is about double the Book Value. But was sold at a price that is a bit higher than the Book Value.

  
So isn‚Äôt it better for the shareholders of TDM if its assets were sold and monies returned to shareholders. Why work hard for 10 years to have negative average earnings? Maybe then the shareholders could reinvest in other better plantation companies.

&#x200B;

Of course, you could argue that looking at historical earnings is not a good reflection of the future. And it is not the full story and TDM has a healthcare arm in addition to its plantation arm.

**$MTNB Matinas Biopharma Holdings Inc.**, a New Jersey-based biotech company, has completed clinical resolution of a patient's recurrent hemorrhagic cystitis due to Candida krusei, a fluconazole-inherited resistant fungal pathogen. The company's MAT2203 treatment led to clinical resolution. Traders are excited about this news, with shares of Matinas Biopharma Holdings currently bid up at $0.2693/share. Matinas BioPharma Holdings is focused on discovering and developing product candidates derived from its lipid-crystal nano-particle delivery technology platform, including MAT2203 and MAT2501.

**Tempest Therapeutics Inc**

**$TPST Tempest Therapeutics**, a clinical-stage oncology company, has seen a 2,000% increase in its share price from 30 cents per share to $6.40. The company, based in Brisbane, California, focuses on developing cancer treatments. Tempest conducted a study with Swiss healthcare company Roche Holdings AG, which found that its PPAR-Œ± antagonist offered a lifeline for patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma when added onto two Roche drugs in a phase 1/2 trial. Patients who received the ""triple treatment"" demonstrated a 30% objective response rate (ORR). Tempest is also testing its effectiveness against other types of tumors. The company has announced a limited-duration stockholder rights plan, but it should not be seen as a response to a takeover threat.

NVIDIA is a leading AI chipmaker with a strong track record of innovation, and as a result, it is facing soaring demand.

However, there are other chipmakers that are also developing AI chips, such as AMD, MU, and QCOM. These companies are investing heavily in research and development, and they are gradually closing the gap with NVIDIA. It is possible that one of these companies will eventually produce chips that are just as good as or even better than NVIDIA's chips.

If I had to place my money on a company other than NVIDIA, I would choose AMD. AMD has been making significant strides in the AI chip market in recent years, and it has a strong portfolio of products that are well-positioned to compete with NVIDIA. AMD is also more affordable than NVIDIA, which could give it an edge in the market.

Ultimately, the future of the AI chip market is uncertain. NVIDIA is the clear leader today, but other companies are making inroads. It is possible that the market will eventually become more competitive, and that one of these companies will surpass NVIDIA.

15vc7su_PATH,PATH,From lessons learned to penny stock success: Crafting a smarter investment path!,"I had thought of investing more in some new penny stocks, but based on my previous mistakes, I thought of doing some research and studying before that. I found a few points to keep in mind while investing in penny stocks. 

Penny stocks, which are known for their volatility and risk, appeal to growth investors due to their large potential returns. Finding successful penny stocks, on the other hand, is tough due to their potential for a quick increase in value and the difficulties in timing the market. Three essential aspects should be examined when identifying promising companies: obscurity, track record, and liquidity.

Financial statements that are vague or incomplete can imply subpar operations, but a company's track record can provide insight into its leadership qualities. Meeting or exceeding expectations on a consistent basis suggests talented leadership with outstanding capital allocation skills. Companies that repeatedly make promises but fail to deliver or blame external causes may be lacking in talent.

Low trading volume can make purchasing and selling shares difficult, perhaps resulting in a large discount to the stock's market price. These characteristics help as preliminary filters to remove poor investment options, but more research and analysis are required before making any investment selections. 

I want to know some more points that will help me with investing in penny stocks. Please help me with this. ",2023-08-19,15,5
15s2ic8_PATH,PATH,Path to $1M in 4 years,"Hey there, I know something similar has been discussed before but I don't remember anything constructive coming out of it, so here we go, trying again:


__Scenario__

You go for a prop firm that allows you to have up to 20 accounts. You go for evaluation + getting to $10,000 on stage 2 (performance) account ( and you start to trade 1 mini contract from there). You go, on average, for 15 points NQ daily - I will not speak for anyone else but for my strategy; this appears to be achievable - I've forward tested for almost half a year now and backtested years back, I'm profitable as of now. Some days you get no set-ups, sometimes you have a losing day but also sometimes you hit 30-40 or more points moves. So as I said, on average, 15 points a day. Ideally, you come in, make one trade per day, and leave. This whole routine and path to get there should take up anywhere from 6 months to a year, including the time where you're actually pulling out some money. This way, you average over $5,000 a month. Let's say, after that one year, you will go on to expand.

__Expansion__

You start 5 evaluations at the same time. Besides trading your ""main"" account with NQ, you use copy trader for these accounts with MNQ. You take the exact same route getting these accounts to the point where you can trade an NQ contract on each of them. Now you have 6 accounts. This took you another year.

For the rest of the accounts (14), you can go halfway through the second batch, or after, let's say you go for it after that. Now you're pulling out over $30k per month and you go for the rest of the accounts, taking you one more year. 

So, here we are, in theory, after 3 years, you have 20 accounts where you're ""safely"" allowed to trade 1 NQ contract (you're leaving $10k buffer in each of them and withdraw anything above that). Now you know for sure you're consistently able to pull off 15 points a day, on average. After commissions, profit split with the prop firm, other expenses, etc., let's say that nets you $250 pre-tax, per trade account. Now, it's times 20 as you have 20 accounts. That's $5,000 a day.

Let's say you start compounding and ""counting"" your actual gains at that point (even though you'll already have around $100k pre-tax from the first 3 years of trading). In four years of this journey (one year in with full 20 accounts), you are a millionaire...

__Discussion__

Now... I need objective perspectives and ideas why this wouldn't work. I don't need just pure hate on prop firms, I don't need conspiracy based theories, I don't need bitter toxic replies of hurt consistently unprofitable egos. I don't need comments about strategies and trading itself per se, this notion considers realistic consistently profitable trading (15 points of NQ per day, on average).

My sceptical thinking (about that particular prop firm):

‚Ä¢ I've only ever heard about eval and PA accounts, I've never heard about anyone being actually funded and what rules are even applying there. The transition itself is described vaguely in a way ""when the right time comes and we say it is the right time, you shall be promoted to a funded account"".

‚Ä¢ As mentioned before, there's no actual information about how the real funded account actually works - is it the same as PA but not on demo but actually live? Can you have 20 of them as well? Plus million other questions...

‚Ä¢ The rules of PA (and funded) accounts are also very vaguely put in their definition - I get the feeling their rules come down to ""you must trade the way we imagine you should trade, otherwise we can block you"" -> which is a very handy and convenient thing to have, especially once someone's actually milking money out of them this way

‚Ä¢ On the other hand, on their payouts page, there's multiple examples where you see the same person withdrawing usually $2000-2500 like 10 to 20 times (i.e. from 10 to 20 accounts) at one moment.

...

One way or another, if you're patient and dedicated enough and have a system that actually works, this should be achievable without you being bloody Ed Seykota kind of genius. So, I'm all ears for some constructive feedback why this shall not work!",2023-08-15,1,70

The goal of this post is to encourage new traders to stay the path and share some of my learning experience. At the end, I‚Äôll share some thoughts on how I‚Äôd go about learning if I were to start over. 

Options are complicated. The internet is a WEALTH of information but can also lead to data overload. This is exacerbated by internet assholes that literally have nothing better to do than try and tear others down online. Don‚Äôt allow their sad toxic existence slow you down. Remember, you‚Äôll rarely find someone who is doing better than you, that takes unnecessary shots at you. Let the trolls feel internet powerful, it‚Äôs the only place they get to. 

I started trading in 2007 and my path was not linear. The first year I was struggling to understand why options existed, how they fit into the broader markets, etc. For the first 3 years I accomplished little. I was bouncing between strategies, haphazardly, without outlining my strategies, tracking results, etc. There are several issues here:
-By not outlining anything, as I changed things, I had no way to objectively determine what variant was responsible for what output. 
-It also led to inconsistent deployment which makes optimization very difficult. 
-For earnings plays, do I want to buy the straddle 10 days out or 7? Should I flatten 3 days out ? 
-When selling IVol into the release, do I want to enter early to enjoy some early vol decay? Or does that expose me to directional movement that off-balances deltas before the release? 
-By writing a plan, we can track each variant and objectively determine what works. 
-I‚Äôd also consider maintaining a test for a set duration, 6M, 1Y, etc. I often found myself moving as soon as I hit a losing streak or got bored.

From the 3-5 year mark I started getting my feet under me. This is also when I experienced my largest loss due to greed and Dunning Kruger effect. The workaround here is the same, write a plan where we think through various scenarios so we‚Äôre not caught off guard and react impulsively. 

From 6-10 years, I created effective tracking (although I wish I started earlier), and began leveraging and scaling. The main thing I wish I did better in this window was spend more time testing how I was going to trade a large account and doubling down on those strategies. After $150K there‚Äôs little difference in trading $1.5M other than scale and some product / entry nuances. Ideally, you can tinker with those details earlier. 

Options are complicated and have a lot of nuances. To everyone‚Äôs dismay, you‚Äôre not going to master them in 5 years. 10,000 hours is the common referred benchmark for expertise. At 5 hours per day, for 365 days per year - you‚Äôll need 6 years at least. Don‚Äôt let that dissuade you. The way we accomplish large challenges is by breaking them into smaller pieces and tackling one by one. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt get scared away from internet nobodies. Find a supportive circle and stick it out. I‚Äôm 32 now in a spot I literally never imagined was possible by doing that exact thing. You got this.",2023-06-16,39,16

Year 1- Study, study, study and paper trade

Year 2- Develop a system and start trading with a small account, say $5,000 until consistently profitable

Year 3- Assuming you're a middle aged person, you probably have savings, long term investments, 401ks etc. So liquidate your assets, and fund a $100k trading account. Generate an average daily return of 0.5% (very modest according to this sub), compounded daily by the end of the year, with 250 trading days, $100k would have turned into \~$348k.

10j8ndp_PATH,PATH,The New Path for Netflix,"Overview

Over the past 25 years Netflix alternated the film and television industry forever. In the early 2000s Netflix founders offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for 50 million, an offer which they turned down, in due course Netflix triumphed over Blockbuster and forced the movie industry to adapt. However in the last year their long streak of unaltered growth came to a halt. 

Netflix was one of lockdown's sweet stocks, however after their all time high Netflix fell over 70%, for a combined reason of increased competition and a fall in followers.

In Q2, Netflix reportedly lost 970,000 subscribers, while their competitor disney plus gained 14.4 million, causing Netflix‚Äôs stock price to reach a valuation of 180. This is the first time that Netflix‚Äôs stock price was under 200 since 2017. 

Due to their recent fall, Netflix is planning on re-inventing themselves. One of their ideas would be to add a new and cheaper subscription option which includes advertising. This Idea is already up and running in the U.S since November and Netflix say they are ‚Äúhappy with the results‚Äù. Nonetheless, Investors have mixed feelings about whether or not including ads would be lucrative for the company. Additionally, It is estimated that Netflix loses around 6 billion dollars in revenue every year due to password sharing. Hence another project Netflix is striving for is to crack down on password sharing. 

Fundamentals

(Netflix)

* 60% of Netflix revenues come from outside the U.S, by consequence the surge in the dollar in comparison to other currencies impacted Netflix negatively. 
* In the past 6 months, Netflix‚Äôs stock price increased over 50%.
* Netflix‚Äôs revenue in Q2 grew 9% year over year, driven by a 6% increase in average paid memberships. 
* For 2022, Netflix finished with 231M paid memberships and generated $32B of revenue, $5.6B in operating income, $2.0B of net cash from operating activities and $1.6B of free cash flow 
* In 2023 Netflix stated that they expect at least 3 billion in free cash flow assuming no f/x (special effects) costs
* Currently Netflix's share price is $342.50. Netflix's Revenue per Share for the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended in Dec. 2022 was $70.06. Hence, Netflix's PS (**Price to Sales)** Ratio for today is 4.89: 
* According to Netflix's latest financial reports and stock price the company's current **price-to-earnings** ratio (TTM) is 29.8445.
* During the past 5 years Netflix‚Äôs **PS** ratio has gone down, with its highest at 14.65 in 2018 and its lowest at 2.7 in may of 2022

(Disney plus) 

* In 2021 Disney plus added 7.6 million subscribers from 38.8 million to 46.4 million subscribers
* Disney + is not lucrative yet and is not planning on becoming lucrative until 2024.
* The average monthly revenue per paying subscriber decreased from 2021 to 2022 from 6.81 to 6.1

Going forward

On January 19, Netflix published its final quarter of 2022 financial statement. 

Netflix recorded a revenue of almost 8 billion dollars, and a net income of 1.4 billion dollars. Furthermore, Netflix documented an exponential surge in their number of subscribers which joined in the 4th quarter compared to how much they expected, 7.66 million new subscribers compared to their expected 4.57 million. This caused their stock price to increase over 8% in a single day. 

Moreover, the Netflix co-founder Read Hastings announced that he will step down as ceo of Netflix appointing former chief operating officer Greg Peters to have executive power over the company alongside Ted Sarandos.

Personally, I believe that Netflix would be a good investment, considering they are still over 50% down from their all time high. Additionally, I think that if done correctly adding advertisements to Netflix has the possibility to be highly lucrative in the future.

107smp5_PATH,PATH,The Path To Becoming Profitable," **The Path To Becoming a CPT**

Throughout my career as a full-time trader and the several years studying leading up to it. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting countless traders both online and offline. Once the pieces of the puzzle started coming together for me, I realized, it didn‚Äôt have to be a puzzle. 

There are statistics that I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all heard that 90% of traders fail. Out of the 10% of traders who do not fail, sub 1% of them make a significant amount of money equivalent to 7 figures or more. 

What really makes trading so hard? 

Is it the nature of it? Is it the high barrier to entry? Is it the lack of knowledge? I personally believe it‚Äôs a mix of all of these things. Every trader I‚Äôve met has shared the adversity of overcoming one huge hurdle. No one knows where to begin when first starting out!

So not only are there tons of speed bumps inherent to becoming a trader but there‚Äôs no clearly defined path in which to study things and build a knowledge base. I‚Äôm going to put together to the best of my ability the study path I‚Äôd take if I were to start again without any of the knowledge I‚Äôve gathered over the last 7 years. 

**Step 1: Foundation**

Assuming we‚Äôre complete novices and all we have is an interest in trading and the stock market. We need to build our foundation. There‚Äôs tons of information out there that you can dive into and plenty of free resources out there for this. Our main goal for step 1 is going to familiarize ourselves with this new world. What is trading? What are the different types of trading one can do? What markets do I want to trade in? 

This is not the time we want to be actually opening an account and buying and selling random things. Just dive into the rabbit hole online and learn about the different types of trading. Day trading, swing trading, scalping, longing, shorting, understanding the concepts of short-term trading and how it differs from our natural knowledge base of the stock market. Many of us have the same premonitions of the stock market prior to studying short-term trading. We simply think of it as our economy or an investment vehicle to aid us towards retirement. Short-term trading is very different from this. It may live in the same universe but it is a completely different world.

**Step 2: Understanding the technicals**

I would go to say a large majority of short-term trading revolves around technical analysis versus fundamental analysis. This isn‚Äôt a matter of which one is better or worse but simply functional use. There are plenty of traders who solely use technicals and have zero use for fundamentals and still make money. While there are some who do the opposite and focus on fundamentals over technicals it‚Äôs simply not the most direct route. 

As always, a good mix of both is useful. Personally, for me, I have an intermediate understanding of fundamentals compared to my understanding of technical analysis. 80% of my trading is based on technicals while around 20% is based on fundamental research.

With that being said, it‚Äôs time to learn! There are many great free resources to learn technical analysis. Stock charts dot com has a great guide in my opinion for all things technical analysis and is a great one-stop resource for the novice. Some other topics regarding technical analysis that are worth studying are continuation patterns, supply and demand zones, volume analysis, trends, and trend reversals, as well as the concept that charts are really just visual representations of market players.

**Step 3: What do I trade?**

There are 4000+ listed stocks if trading the US markets and that does not account for any OTC stocks as well which would bring us up to 16,000 total stocks. So what the hell do I even trade? 

This question is easy to answer if the goal is I want to be a short-term trader and not an investor. As short-term traders, we get the luxury of letting the plays come to us, whereas an investor needs to figure out the next sound company to park their capital into the markets. As short-term traders, we need momentum to trade. We need volume and liquidity. We need range as well. There are tons of terms that get thrown around for what we are looking for and to name a few, there are active stocks, the flavor of the day, top % gainers, and stocks in play. 

The goal for us as short-term traders are to find stocks that are active and prime for trading. You want stocks that are on the move and opening up a playing field where we can find setups. Look for top % gainers whether that be on an intraday time frame, or even a daily or weekly time frame. Look for stocks that are trading more than their average range (ADR). Look for stocks that are trading more than their average daily volume (ADV). 

If you start here, you will begin to find patterns that you can turn into setups. To start, look each day at the end of the session at the 5 stocks that moved the most with say at least 2X their ADV. This will get you to at least begin to look at active stocks regularly where you want to be in short-term trading. 

**Step 4: Edge‚Ä¶ Looking for patterns**

Now that we‚Äôre looking at the right stocks on a daily basis we want to see if we can start identifying patterns. A pattern can really be anything and it doesn‚Äôt need to be a technical analysis-based pattern but can be anything repetitive that leads to a similar outcome. Check out the playbook by Mike Bellafiore as well as their youtube channel, SMB capital for edge ideas. 

Once you think you‚Äôve found a pattern that you see often, start to log its occurrence. There are also websites where you can pull historical data and find past occurrences of the pattern as well. 

**Step 5: Trade Management**

The goal now is to build a process around the pattern we‚Äôve found to execute it. Study the past occurrences of the setup. Find commonalities for when the move you are looking to capture originates as well as invalidates. Put systems into place and entry rules that will get you in your setup. Put systems into place to manage risk in your trade. Put systems into place to exit your trade and take profits. 

The goal here is to define setups of what you‚Äôre looking for in the market and then have a specific process tailored to how you will execute that setup to capture the opportunity as well as manage risk in the case that the trade is a failure. 

**Step 6: Review**

Once you have a process in place where you are looking for setups based on criteria you‚Äôve set from the above setups and you are executing them consistently with the processes you‚Äôve put in place you will need to review. You will be getting constant feedback each day of trading that will have you tinker and tweak your process. Think of the concept of getting 1% better each day. At the end of the year, you will be left with a completely different but most likely better process than what you started the year with. 

Review each trade as well as action on a weekly and monthly basis. See where you could have really maximized the potential of the opportunity you are capturing. Test different ideas for entries, add, and exits to see if there are creative ways you can capture more PnL from these trades. It‚Äôs a never-ending game of optimization and managing your trading edge.

**Thoughts**

I could write up countless other steps that are maybe not as useful and clear for your journey to becoming a consistently profitable trader. Look at these steps as books within a series, and with each book, it is up to you to find the chapters. 

If you create a foundation for yourself to understand the world of short-term trading and then move on to becoming proficient at technical analysis and having a general understanding of fundamental analysis then you‚Äôre in a great spot. Most people who begin their journey into trading actually get to this point within the path as well from my observations. Where they get lost is after this. They begin joining boiler room chat rooms, they subscribe to services that are alerting BS trade ideas when in reality it‚Äôs just a pump-and-dump scheme. They fall into the WSB and YOLO mentality and don‚Äôt manage their risk. Really all they are doing is treating the stock market as their mobile at-home casino. You do not want to be this person. 

After you complete the first two steps outlined above I believe there are two directions you can take on the path. One will add years of struggle, losses, and pain to your journey while the other will continue building upon your new knowledge and help you get to profitability.

Understand profitable trading is a game of probabilities and having an edge. Research trading statistics and make sure you are trading with edge before you even decided to risk real money. You should know your win rate on your setup, the average drawdown, the average winner, and the average loser. This is all information you should know about your setup before you even think about risking real money in the markets.

If you choose to go in the direction that will get you closer to profitability it‚Äôs all about thinking for yourself. After the first two steps, understand all you need to do from here is to discover edge and learn the concepts of how to trade it with positive expectancy. Instead of going into paid services that are going to teach you strategies or searching on youtube holy grail trading systems. Study the daily stocks in play, and look for patterns that you see with your own eyes. Backtest these ideas and create systems and processes around how you can systematically manage these trades. Create an excel database and calculate your probabilities and odds for your trade setups. 

I promise, attacking the market with this mindset versus a gambling mindset will save you years of heartache and frustration. This path will still yield plenty of frustration and struggle, but it‚Äôs a much more clear shot to profitability.

As always, if you need help on your journey or a sounding board to bounce some ideas off feel free to reach out and I‚Äôd be glad to help.

Cheers & Happy Trading!",2023-01-09,161,64

xl38ph_PATH,PATH,"Senator Elizabeth Warren has said ""I‚Äôve been warning that Chair Powell‚Äôs Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work ‚Äî and I fear he‚Äôs already on the path to doing so.""","Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear that unemployment will have to increase to some degree. The ‚Äúlabor market continues to be out of balance,‚Äù he said, and slower growth will necessarily push up the unemployment rate. Fed officials now expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% in 2023 and remain at the level in 2024 before inching lower to 4.3% in 2025.

The fundamental goal, as Powell has stated many times, is to restore price stability to the economy. ‚ÄúPrice stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWithout price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.‚Äù

xhceyb_PATH,PATH,Goldman Cuts US Growth Forecast for 2023 After Rate Path Change," Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its US economic growth estimates for 2023 after recently boosting its predictions for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.

US gross domestic product will increase 1.1% in 2023, economists including Jan Hatzius wrote in a note Friday, compared with a forecast of 1.5% previously. The projection for 2022 was left unchanged at 0%.

Goldman raised its federal funds rate forecast by 75 basis points over the last two weeks for a terminal rate forecast of 4% to 4.25% by the end of 2022.

‚ÄúThis higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial conditions implies a somewhat worse outlook for growth and employment next year,‚Äù the economists said. ‚ÄúOur growth forecast is slightly below consensus and implies a below-potential growth trajectory that we believe is necessary to cool wage and price inflation.‚Äù

The Fed‚Äôs rate-hike path has been a top focus for economists and investors this year as the central bank seeks to cool stubbornly high inflation.

Goldman also raised forecasts for the unemployment rate to reflect the lower growth, saying it will be about 3.7% by end-2022, compared with a call for 3.6% previously. It will rise to 4.1% by the end of 2023 versus 3.8% previously, and to 4.2% by end-2024 compared with a prior estimate of 4%.

umgo4g_PATH,PATH,The Cryptocurrency path to sanity," 

Hello, i read a lot of FUD post these days about how we all lost our money with the crypto crash and it is the proof that crypto is a bubble etc.

I am not considering myself a crypto guru but i am really happy in this bear market and i wonder why the most people do not like this. The Black Friday is finally here in the crypto space!!!

If you are in crypto for years you know and there is a smile in your face right now, but i have to say something to the new ones. Remember when you found out cryptocurrency and start investing? Remember when you said ""oh now is expensive to buy BTC, i wish i had bought before""?

There is a sad truth to understand. In a bull market everything looks expensive to you and in a bear market everything looks destroyed and not worth to invest. The market is always up and down and because of this, we have a chance to grow our portfolio. In a stable market there is no opportunity to make a profit. We like unstable market!

Be careful with small projects that may loose momentum and go to zero, invest only a very small amount just in case it skyrocket. Stick to the monsters of crypto (BTC, ETH) for long term profit.

Zoom out a BTC or Eth price chart and you will see that in the long term it is only up!

Never leave your crypto in a centralized exchange. There is always risk for a hack, block account or stop supporting your country. Move them to your hardware wallet. Buy hardware wallet only from official website.

So now some steps of my personal view of the situation for the path of sanity:

1. Invest only money you don't need.
2. When markets crash, BUY.
3. When markets crash, DO NOT SELL.
4. Sell ONLY FOR PROFIT in a bull market.
5. Don't panic.
6. Market will go up again. Just wait.
7. You never loose if you don't sell with a loss.
8. Be happy in a bear market, you have the opportunity to buy more with less fiat.
9. Drink a beer and relax, wish you the best!",2022-05-10,21,35

udj9k0_PATH,PATH,Benchmark Metals Achieves 93% Gold Recovery and Confirms Strong Precious Metals Results Towards the Path to Gold and Silver Production [Catalyst],"Benchmark Metals (BNCHF) has just announced advanced metallurgical laboratory test results for the Lawyers gold-silver Project. 

The testwork has provided **gold leach recoveries averaging 93%, and silver recoveries of approximately 65%** from the Amethyst Gold Breccia (AGB) and Cliffs Creek resources. 

The advanced test work confirms a simple preliminary design using conventional whole rock cyanide leaching and incorporating Merrill Crowe zinc precipitation to produce on-site gold and silver Dore. The test work builds a large data set throughout the main Amethyst Gold Breccia (AGB) and Cliffs Creek resource areas, in addition to composites representing potentially the first years of mining in a conceptual mine plan. The Lawyers Project is located in the historic mining region of the Golden Horseshoe, located in north-central British Columbia (BC), Canada.

Jim Greig, President and Director, commented, ""**The results demonstrate exceptional gold recovery from rocks utilizing a conventional and proven method that results in pouring gold and silver Dore bars.** Technical results and participation from miners like **Yamana Gold in Benchmark Metals continues to validate the potential to become Canada's next major gold and silver mine**.""

Ian Harris, VP Engineering, commented, ""We are very encouraged by the metallurgical test results that demonstrate robust recovery on a standard conceptual mining schedule and support using a straightforward, proven, industry norm, processing flow sheet. The growing data set is now incorporated into our modelling and supportive of the evaluation of multiple mining scenarios for future feasibility level evaluations.""

**The supporting studies have been conducted by several globally recognized laboratories including:**

* ALS Laboratory - Kamloops, BC: for detailed comminution testing;
* BV Mineral Process Laboratories - Richmond, BC: for optimization and variability gravity treatment and bottle roll leaching studies;
* FLSmidth Inc. - Salt Lake City, Utah: for leach response confirmation, gravity pre-treatment, and filtration test work, and;
* SGS Mineral Services - Lakefield, Ontario: for treatment circuit simulation for the leach process, liquid/solid separation, and Merrill Crowe.  


  
Various mineralogical studies have also been performed on AGB and Cliffs Creek samples that indicate the gold is primarily present as fine native particles. Depending on the sample specimen, the silver occurs predominantly as acanathite (Ag2S), or electrum, often as coarser particles of 200 microns or greater, although it can be fine grained as well. To a lesser extent native silver is present.

u8qqs1_PATH,PATH,Path Forward : Guessing Schumer's moves ahead of Midterms,"Before going into the details , I humbly remind the reader that I am a normal investor and doesn't have any insider information on Capitol hill movements. So , these are not investment suggestions , just trying to stay calm in the face of extreme inaction... your fellow bag holder

I OPTIMISTICALLY ASSUME THAT SCHUMER IS WILLING TO DO SOMETHING AND WILL NOT GIVEUP THIS CONGRESSIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE NAME OF ALL ENCOMPASSING BILL

Just like many of you, upon seeing the democrats getting control of both the houses , I was elated , joyous and dove into Weed markets ignoring the historical inaction on the Capitol hill and history repeated itself and NOTHING I mean NOTHING happened .If we can forget the nightmarish 2021, 2022 does carry some sort of optimism and these are my opinions on how it may play out...

SAFE baking in COMPETES Act: 

For some reason I cannot shake the feeling that Schumer will not let the SAFE banking bill part of competes act because it will not gain him anything , no social justice aspect nothing to use as an election tool and mainly Schumer has no hand in it . It is hard to believe that Senate will simply bow down to House and give up such a huge win and let it pass silently. So I give 20% of surprise chance of SAFE banking passing in the Competes ACT.

Schumer's SAFE+ in the next couple of months (May - June):

That being said about Competes act , it is not entirely in Schumer's favor to simply ignore and do nothing about SAFE , not before midterms , when the control of both the houses hangs in the balance. So they need to pass something to tout about their glorious work on this huge issue and the social justice they have done for Minorities in the election campaign.

I believe he might introduce a new bill which include the Federal Record Expungements ( Including funds to the states to process expungements at state level) + Tax reform (280E) + Banking as a package and present it as SAFE+ . Because of the limited scope of the bill , it has very good chance of getting the republican support. This scenario is very likely and he may use this during Competes act negotiation to cool down the house representatives. The senate is also under enormous pressure to pass the SAFE banking act due to the lives lost as a result of CASH dealing weed stores.  I give this 60% of chance and this may be the only path for the reminder of this congress.

CAOA before AUGUST Recess:

By announcing that the bill will be introduced so late during midterms , this approach has very very less chance of passing. By the time they introduce the Bill , majority of the congressional candidates are knee deep in election campaigns and once the election is over . I don't think republicans will let something this huge during the lame duck period... So I give this 5% of passing.

It also entirely possible that this Congress will not do anything and let republicans take over both chambers. But don't feel down , this market is a winner in the long term , fundamentals didn't change and guard your Bags with hawk eyes .... Cheers my fellow bag holders...",2022-04-21,39,23

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub.

So currently I am on the verge of blowing up my $100k account...I started seriously pursuing trading for a living June 2019.

noye28_PATH,PATH,"[CAREER ADVICE] Middle of crossfire, feel like I'll be setting my path in stone.","Hello all,

*I know algotrading isn't quite the subreddit for these questions, so feel free to delete this post. However, people here have the same interests as I do regarding algotrading; hence the reason I ask it here as well as* [r/financialcareers](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialcareers/) .

Let me first give some background, I am in my final year of a bachelors in mathematics and planning to do a masters in quant. finance next year. I have done quite some projects and worked interesting jobs and feel like I've got a strong resume. I have got quite some interest in trading and would like to work in finance.

This year I've joined an innovative startup in energy trading, during this job I've learned a lot; from analytics to execution. However, we never really got to trading as investors bolted just before we could launch. I believe that the partners got in some disagreement and investors could sense this, but this is all speculation. The problem arises here, all partners are extremely nice and helpful. They are willing to give me leads, recommendations and referrals. However, I feel these offers are quite mutually exclusive.

**Offer 1:**

One partner offered me a job so we could relaunch startup but focus more on analytics side and move to trading side when (and if) we attract new investors. This offer seems very fun as I could focus on what I want in analytics and let creativy fuel my brain. This partner is very fair and if there is profit to be made, he will split evenly. Furthermore, the partner keeps my study in mind and will plan accordingly. Pay is out of own pocket, so compensation will be not good first few months (if ever) but experience wise I'll grow a lot if I can leverage this correctly.

The only real downside to this is the fact that I get the feeling I'll be setting my path in stone. This startup will be energy related and I feel like my opportunities in the world of finance will be slimming. Even though I believe this job can be leveraged quite good on CV, I am afraid I won't ever get out of energy if I take this.

**Referral 2:**

One of the other partners offered to drop my CV at a top MM; he has worked there for quite some time so this has some value as well. This MM also has academic jobs so I could work there during my masters as well. The problem is, I'm aware that a referral in MM's do not really mean anything. You still have to pass all tests (which are the hardest in this MM), do the interviews and eventually get accepted. But compensation wise, this is extremely good if you get accepted.

Real downside to this referral is the fact that if I don't get accepted, I am not allowed to ever apply again (according to MM). This time of year, I'm quite busy with thesis, school and extracurricular so I won't have a lot of time to do mental maths, brainteasers and just in general preparing without the detoriation of quality in other areas. Also, I and the other partner (from **1**) can get along real well with eachother and I learned (and can learn) a lot from him.

**Questions:**

* How to leverage a startup that stopped all operations on CV?
* What is best option for me/ what would you choose?
* Do you think if my CV is dropped at MM, I can apply in half a year when I have more time?
* Am I stuck in field X, if I take opportunity 1?

**TLDR**; I *(feel like I)* can choose between startup in energy or a referral in MM *(to which if I fail I can never apply again)*.

Thank you guys for your time.",2021-05-31,37,14

nh3913_PATH,PATH,3D Systems Is on the Path to $28. Why It‚Äôs Time to Buy DDD Stock & Other 3D Printing Stocks.,"What Happened to the 3D Systems Stock Price Today?

3D printing leader¬†3D Systems¬†(NYSE:DDD) reported blowout first quarter numbers, and investors cheered the results by sending DDD stock up more than 15%.

‚Ä¢The blowout earnings report and subsequent stock price jump does little to ‚Äúfix‚Äù what has been a broken stock for months now. From its early 2021 highs, DDD stock is still off more than 50%.

‚Ä¢We think recent weakness is a great buying opportunity, and that the big rebound in 3D printings stocks starts now.

-Why It Happened

‚Ä¢3D Systems‚Äô first quarter earnings reports was stellar. In short, it was a huge double-beat quarter with accelerating revenue growth and improving margins.

‚Ä¢On the top-line, analysts were looking for essentially flat revenue growth, following just 2% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. But revenues smashed estimated, and rose 8% year-over-year. On an organic basis ex certain business divestitures, revenues rose an impressive 17% year-over-year.

‚Ä¢The healthcare business is booming (up 36%). The industrial business is recovering with the economy (organic industrial sales were up 1%).

‚Ä¢On the bottom-line, 3D Systems smashed expectations by even more.

‚Ä¢Strong top-line performance and demand flowed through into stronger-than-expected pricing and healthy gross margins. Gross margins clocked in at 44%, up from 42% both a year ago and last quarter.

‚Ä¢Strong top-line performance also coupled with strict expense control to spark huge EBITDA margin expansion. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 13.2% in the quarter. A year ago, they were sitting at just 1.6%.

‚Ä¢Analysts were expecting just two cents for EPS on the bottom-line. 3D Systems reported a number nearly 9X that big at 17 cents.

‚Ä¢It was an amazing quarter. DDD stock surged in response.

-Does It Matter?

‚Ä¢This print matters in more ways than one.

For 3D Systems, it matters because it shows that this company is, indeed, on a rebounding growth trajectory that is causing meaningful improvements in revenues, margins, and profits. That‚Äôs a huge win for DDD stock.

For the broader 3D printing industry, it matters because it shows that all the hype in this space that emerged in late 2020 was not overstated. It was legit, as it is being backed up in early 2021 by very strong numbers. Growth in this space is unequivocally and rapidly accelerating, as 3D printing functionality goes up and costs come down, to a point where these machines are ready to redefine manufacturing everywhere.

That‚Äôs a huge win for other 3D printings stocks, like¬†Stratasys¬†(NASDAQ:SSYS) and¬†ExOne¬†(NASDAQ:XONE).

-DDD Stock Price Forecast

We think 3D printings stocks are ready to rebound after a big lull over the past few months.

This rising tide will lift all boats, DDD stock included.

The consensus analyst price target on DDD stock is $28.

We see no reason why shares can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt rally toward that level over the next 12 months.

The once sleepy and left-for-dead 3D printing industry is ready to wake up and sprint into hypergrowth mode over the next decade.

For years, 3D printing was too slow, too expensive and too niche to be useful. Unless you consider small-scale, one-off prototyping as useful. The industry, though, has made huge technical advancements over the past several years. Today, 3D printers are printing faster than ever. This thanks to more efficient layer-by-layer printing technology. A byproduct of which is that they are becoming very affordable, as manufacturing processes have been streamlined, economics of scale has kicked in and material costs have plummeted. Most importantly, they are now able to print in metal (as opposed to just plastic), which makes them immediately usable on the factory floor.

The result is that more and more companies are incorporating rapid, cost-effective, metal 3D printing capabilities into their actual assembly lines. It‚Äôs the beginning of the long-overdue 3D Printing Revolution.

This industry is at a critical inflection point. It‚Äôs been a no-growth market for several years. Now, over the next few years, it‚Äôs going to transform into a sustainable 20%-plus growth market as a new generation of fast and affordable metal AM machines make their way onto factory floors everywhere, printing end-use parts for cars, planes, rocket-ships, medicine, and more.

We think these stocks could soar more than 10X in the coming years as they lead the world into a new of digital and on-demand manufacturing.

I've been working at this for about 9 months now. First, I looked into day trading, then learned of swing trading, and find that's more my speed.

I watched a lot of YouTube videos, opened an Ameritrade account, got the ToS software, and did a lot of paper trading.

I read a day trading book, then a swing trading book, took a technical analysis course from Ameritrade, looked at all the sites I thought others were looking at, like stocktwits, seekingalpha, tradingviews, finviz, ...

I subscribed to a few paid newsletters, but it seems it's better to figure this out myself. I've been trying to learn some patterns, mostly from the swing trading book, like looking for bull flags and reversals, and I've gone through the different scanner sites. I pay for one. 

I get a little overwhelmed with so many options. 

What do you mostly do, do you read the news, go through your scanners, use both technical and fundamental analysis?",2020-12-21,1,6

**As always PM me for more in-depth analysis on SPY and I'll send you my google doc. There's a form on the doc. asking for what other stocks you want me to analyze. Fill it out and I'll start analyzing other stocks for you guys if you wish!**

The test for SPY today will be at 361.33. If she can stay above the current resistance, then we will see a positive morning.

If not, depending on how far she falls, we could have a gloomy day in general - follow the white downtrend support and resistance.

CLIFF NOTE SUMMARY - SPY fell out of uptrend channel and into downtrend channel.

gkmbix_PATH,PATH,House Passes $3 Trillion Democratic Stimulus With No Path to Law,"The House passed a $3 trillion Democratic economic stimulus bill Friday that Republicans and President Donald Trump have already rejected and isn‚Äôt likely to trigger bipartisan negotiations any time soon.

The measure, passed 208-199, would give cash-strapped states and local governments more than $1 trillion while providing most Americans with a new round of $1,200 checks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it should be the basis of talks with the GOP-controlled Senate and White House, which have called for a ‚Äúpause‚Äù to allow earlier coronavirus recovery spending to work.

Pelosi this week has repeatedly invoked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who has said Congress will have to inject more fiscal stimulus into the economy to prevent a prolonged recession. The U.S. has more than 1.4 million coronavirus cases, and more than 86,000 have died.

But Republicans also cite the Fed chief, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying Powell hasn‚Äôt explicitly said how quickly Congress must act. He and other Republicans have dismissed the House Democrats‚Äô bill as a liberal wish list and are using it to attack Democrats, whom polls give an increasing chance of holding the House and taking the Senate in November‚Äôs election.

‚ÄúThis is much more about political messaging than effective legislating,‚Äù Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said.

Powell Warns of Broad Virus Danger, Bats Down Negative Rates

GOP members said some provisions don‚Äôt belong in a virus bill, such as reductions in immigration enforcement, providing stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants, money for the troubled U.S. Postal Service and a national requirement to hold elections by mail.

Trump and Republican congressional leaders have acknowledged, however, that some sort of further economic stimulus will likely be necessary as the economy continues to shed jobs. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits since March now exceeds 36 million.

‚ÄúPhase four is going to happen but it‚Äôs going to happen in a much better way for the American people,‚Äù Trump old reporters Friday. He said he holds leverage over Democrats in any future talks.

‚ÄúWe have all the cards because we have the cards of the American people. I know what they want,‚Äù the president said.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said he anticipates another bill eventually.

Right now, I feel like I've absorbed a lot of different sources (ranging  good to bad) and I am now settling on a couple things that I feel will continue pushing me forward to finally focus on that Alpha (I know what this is but still don't understand it).Right now, I have a background in coding in R. Using it to clean/scrub market data and also how to run different quantitative financial calculations on them to return ticks that fit those calculations. I learned this at University along with Time Series but I need to relearn as I could not grasp it well.My current sources includeData Camp: To learn more R code. I believe there are courses on their that stem into Finance and Linear Regression

Ernst P Chan: All his books starting with Quantitative Trading. Overall, I've heard good and bad about reading these but at the end of the day, despite them being a little dated, they still seem like the holy grail of jumping into algorithmic trading as an ""intermediate"" coder.

Old course materials: I took two courses that served as strong foundations for my interest here. One pertained to coding in R and how to clean and scrub market data. The other delved into time series where our final project took two cryptocurrencies to test some form of correlation. They didn't and I did not understand the course very well. Little did I know that it's exactly what I'm trying to learn now that I have grown and learned more about its potential in the market. 

Personally, my end goal is to have a system (not referring to a trading system) where I have the working environment  I need to code and pull data and test out different trading ideas I have. I know that's a fundamental 'duh' concept but I personally don't know how to manifest that for myself in a way I'm comfortable. I already trade on the market in my own time so I understand the general market behavior and that's why I have a very strong intrinsic motivation to take two huge things I've cultivated and found interest in over the years and combine them. If anyone can confirm that I am still pulling on the right threads of interest to eventually get to where I want to go, I'd love it as I know nobody can give me an outline of how to do everything cause that's ridiculous or if anyone has input on other sources to consider or to go to next! :) Thanks! I really love this sub for opening my eyes to a bigger picture goal that utilizes many of the individual skills and interests I've had over the years.

With every other television provider getting into streaming, programs that people love will continue to drop off and eventually Netflix will be composed of weird foreign shows and their own sporadically good original content. People will gravitate towards streaming services that apply to their tastes like HBO shows, Disney shows and eventually everyones brother, mother, father will stop subscribing in lieu for their own streaming taste prefecences and no one will be there to take on their own subscription of Netflix. Once this occurs Netflix's subscriber numbers will drop off like flies. Essentially this argument would apply to all streaming services but since this effects Netflix's entire business model I am going to to focus on it almost entirely.

Optimistically, there will be a company in the future that works to bundle these numerous streaming services into one package and that will take the place of the new cool streaming company that Netflix once was, that is unless Netflix reads the writing on the wall and does exactly that.",2019-07-18,18,50

I think the title says it all. I'm 23 and currently working at a store. As i only work part time i had plenty of time to dedicate myself to something that i really like and for that reason, i've been researching into financial markets/economics and computer science on my own. I have some trading tools and indicators developed by myself and i find no difficulty at all getting good at programming (there is a lot of information on the internet on this) but i think it is time i take the other part of the field into academic levels. I think that maybe it will open me a door to work with other like-minded individuals and that may make me a great indepedent trader.

I want a bachelor and a masters degree. Can you help me choose a pair of courses? My currently pool of possible pairs are:

Bachelor's in economics and master's in finance

Bachelor's in economics and master's in computer science

Bachelor's in mathematics and amster's in finance

Bachelor's in economics and master's in data science

TL:DR : i want to know a  good pair of courses (bachelor's + master's) for someone who already has some experience in programming and trading and wants to develop his own tools to trade for himself (or for anybody else as long as it involves both programming and finance)",2018-11-15,3,8

98c7ia_PATH,PATH,What can go wrong with this career path into algorithmic trading?,"Hi!

I'm a software developer and I'm almost 40 years old. I always wanted to create a systems-dependent business, i. e. one where revenue is not tied to me working (where I don't sell my time for dollars).

By ""business"" I mean a source of income that would generate enough money for two people living in a Western country, with one of them (me) working for 40 hours per week (that would be 4000-6000 Euros after taxes). Ideally, that source of income would be location-independent so that I can live wherever I want.

I also prefer to work as a freelancer without a boss and without employees to manage. Also, I'm getting older and I want to have a source of income where nobody can fire me (or make me retire) because of my age. I was looking for a business idea that would provide money for me when I'm too old for the labor market (I don't want to rely on the state pension system).

Recently I had a business idea that seems perfect for me. Therefore, I want to do a [pre-mortem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) -- I would appreciate, if you wrote in the comments all possible reasons this strategy could fail. I value honesty over politeness, therefore be as direct as possible.

**What is the product I want to create?**

Trading algorithms.

**How much do I want to earn?**

Between 48,000 and 72,000 Euros per month after taxes (55,000 -- 83,000 dollars) per year.

**How do I want to achieve that goal?**

The road to that goal consists of two phases:

1. Learning
2. Operating

**Phase 1: Learning (1-5 years)**

First, I would learn the basics of quantitative finance and try out the concepts in IPython notebooks. This is important because I learn things through experimentation.

Second, and most important: I would develop trading algorithms on Quantopian (or any other platform with similar functionality), run backtests on them, and submit them to their contest. In scope of that contest the performance of trading algorithms is evaluated over a period over 60 days on current (non-historical) data.

Latter two items (backtests and the contest) would give me feedback, which is crucial for learning. Especially the backtesting looks like a way to get feedback on the quality of my algorithms fast. It almost looks like I could use [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) to become better.

I don't expect to earn any profits during that time. Therefore I will work full-time to support myself during this time and work for about 20 hours per week on trading algorithm business (20 hours per week in addition to a 40-hour job is definitely doable according to my time tracking statistics).

**Phase 2: Operating (after phase 1 till my death)**

This phase starts when I have developed several well-performing algorithms on a regular basis.

Now I could

* license them to other people or institutions (i. e. they buy the code of my algorithm and use it to invest their money) and
* use them myself (I invest my own money) via a platform like [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com).

**Why do I like this idea?**

* **Fun:** I could earn money by following my interests. I always wanted to know how the economy works. In order to develop successful trading algorithms, I will need to deepen my knowledge in economics and finance. Also, if I manage to create profitable trading algorithms, this will be a proof that my understanding of how the economy works, is correct. In fact, I came up with this idea after asking myself ""How can I make money doing macroeconomics?"". Learning about economics (with finance being part of it) is fun. This can help push through the learning phase. Also, I tried to get into finance in my youth, but it failed (I approached the whole thing from the wrong angle). Building this business is like making my childhood's dreams come true.
* **Fast and easy feedback:** It's very easy to get feedback on the quality of my product (the algorithm). At least one platform gives you several metrics on how well your algorithm performed in real life (tells you where you can improve). This is different from most other products. For example, if the product is an app or a web site, it's challenging to find out whether or not it will be useful for the target audience. Even finding people who would give meaningful feedback on a product idea is hard because most products and services are so multi-faceted.
* **Tailored to my personality:** I like situations, where I can make money based on my skills. Like, I come to a company, they ask me to do a test task, and then hire me based on results. Some of the companies that hired me that way didn't care about my personality, whether I can present myself, whether I'm likable, whether I had experience etc. I assume that when I sell trading algorithms, it's the same -- my skills matter, my personality doesn't. Analogy: Imagine a weight-lifting competition. A shy person whom nobody knows walks in and lifts a record weight. He or she will get the prize, regardless of his personality and whether or not they have connections. (And if that person is too weak, they will know exactly by how much.)
* Contrary to most other products, an algorithm can sell itself. That's good because I'm not a particularly good communicator.
* I can re-use my programming skills to generate a semi-passive income.
* I assume you can do this business from any place in the world with a good enough Internet connection.
* Value for the customer is easily visible. I can see how much money an algorithm can generate for its owner. It is much harder to estimate the financial upside of an app, a web site, a gadget, or a software development service. This means it is easier to sell a good trading algorithm than a good app, web site membership, gadget, or software development service.

**What can go wrong?**

I am aware of the following risks to this plan. Feel free to comment on them (especially, if you consider a particular risk very, very unlikely) and **add your own ideas of what can fail**.

* I fail to acquire the knowledge and skills required to create quality algorithms (fail to complete the learning phase).
  * Counter-argument: See the part about fun. On several occasions in my life I did things related to economics and finance out of pure interest. The earliest time when I got interested in economics was at an age of 5-7 years. It's easier to push through hard times when the thing you are doing is fun.
* My math skills are not good enough.
  * Counter-argument: In the past I co-operated or hired people to help me with math problems that were too hard to me. When I can't learn a mathematical concept from a book, I usually can learn it with the help of another human.
* Due to a catastrophic event, such as Dollar losing its status as the reserve currency, the stock market collapses and nobody needs any trading algorithms any more.
* There are not enough buyers for trading algorithms in Europe (especially in its German-speaking parts such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria) apart from platforms like Quantopian and CloudQuant.
* There are potential buyers for the algorithms, but they don't want to work with me for cultural reasons. I can imagine that a big bank would never buy anything from a one-man-company, regardless how good the product is.
* I need to become certified to sell my trading algorithms (or buy-sell signals based on them) and the bureaucratic hurdles are insurmountable (I'm not sure whether it applies to selling algorithms, but [this list](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/setting-up-an-algorithmic-trading-business) of requirements is frightening).
* Algorithmic trading becomes outlawed.
* Trading platforms (Quantopian, CloudQuant, QuantConnect and others) go out of business and I won't be able to sell my algorithms to anybody.
* Revolution in AI makes human algorithm developers obsolete.
* Using my own algorithms with own money on platforms like QuantConnect turns out to be not viable because of too high transaction fees. I heard such complaint about Robin Hood trading platform (the fees are so high that an average investor can't make profits trading on this platform).

Thanks in advance

Policy makers continued to project a total of three increases this year

EDIT:

The Fed kept interest rates near zero for seven years after the financial crisis. It began slowly raising rates in December 2015. The Fed has now raised rates six times since the crisis-era lows.

Full article from Bloomberg:

Federal Reserve officials, meeting for the first time under Chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point and forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing an improving economic outlook. Policy makers continued to project a total of three increases this year.

‚ÄúThe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,‚Äù the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. Officials repeated previous language that they anticipate ‚Äúfurther gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.‚Äù

The upward revision in their rate path suggests Fed officials are looking through soft first-quarter economic reports and expect a lift this year and next from tax cuts passed by Republicans in December. Financial conditions have tightened since late January as investors look for signs that the central bank might raise rates at a faster pace, while forecasters predict stronger U.S. growth and tight labor markets.

The vote to lift the federal funds rate target range to 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent was a unanimous 8-0.

The latest set of quarterly forecasts forecasts showed that policy makers were divided over the outlook for the benchmark interest rate in 2018. Seven officials projected at least four quarter-point hikes would be appropriate this year, while eight expected three or fewer increases to be warranted.

In the forecasts, U.S. central bankers projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9 percent by the end of 2019, implying three rate increases next year, compared with two 2019 moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December. They saw rates at 3.4 percent in 2020, up from 3.1 percent in December, according to the median estimate.

Inflation Pickup
In another change to the statement, the Fed said inflation on an annual basis is ‚Äúexpected to move up in coming months,‚Äù after saying ‚Äúmove up this year‚Äù in the January statement. Price gains are still expected to stabilize around the Fed‚Äôs 2 percent target over the medium term, the FOMC said.


The central bank‚Äôs preferred price gauge rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through January and officials projected it to rise to 2 percent in 2019 and hit 2.1 percent the following year, the latest estimates showed. The estimates for inflation excluding food and energy, which officials see as a better way to gauge underlying price trends, rose to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020 from 2 percent seen in December.

‚ÄúJob gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,‚Äù the FOMC said. The statement said that household spending and business investment ‚Äúhave moderated‚Äù from strong fourth-quarter readings.

The statement also repeated previous language that ‚Äúnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.‚Äù

Powell will hold his first post-FOMC press conference at 2:30 p.m. local time.

Supply, Demand
The Fed‚Äôs goal is to keep supply and demand in balance in the economy amid a tight labor market, without lifting borrowing costs so quickly that the economy stalls.

Officials have had to factor in the impact of fiscal stimulus signed by President Donald Trump since their previous projections.

The median estimate for economic growth this year rose to 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent in December, signaling confidence in U.S. consumers despite recent weak readings on retail sales that have pushed down tracking estimates of first-quarter activity. The 2019 estimate rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent.

The committee‚Äôs forecast for the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy was unchanged at 1.8 percent, suggesting policy makers are still skeptical of the effect of tax cuts on the economy‚Äôs capacity for growth. The 2020 gross domestic product growth median projection was also unchanged at 2 percent.

While U.S. unemployment of 4.1 percent is the lowest since 2000, wage growth has remained moderate and inflation has been below the Fed‚Äôs target for most of the last five years.

The median projection for the long-run fed funds rate ticked up to 2.9 percent from 2.8 percent in December. The Fed had been gradually reducing its estimate of the long-run neutral fed funds rate since it began publishing its calculations in January 2012.

Estimates for the long-run sustainable unemployment rate also declined, pushing the median down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent seen in December.",2018-03-21,158,51

7vd9kx_PATH,PATH,AT&T acquisition of Straight Path Communications - something fishy or normal?,"Hey All,

I'm just trying to get a grasp of this situation and whether it is uncommon or not.

On the 10th of april 2017 ""Straight Path Communications Inc. issued a press release announcing that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with AT&T Inc."" which shoots up the market value of the company by around a 100 % over the next couple of weeks (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/732717/000121390017003560/f8k0417_straightpath.htm). This is a Monday, and the Thursday the week before insiders sell 1.403.349 shares and misses a silly 204 mUSD stock appreciation. The day after an insider buys 60.000 shares and banks 8,6 mUSD.

BUT this isn't the crazy part...

03-29-2017 (12 days prior) they rush through an Form 3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 issuing a lot of warrants with a strike price 34,70 plus the same amount of warrants that may become issuable between July 1, 2017 and December 1, 2017 at the same exercise price. At this point in time the shares will already be trading at 180,99.

So the big chunk sold makes me think that there was not anything to be know in advance, but the issue of warrants make me think otherwise. I must admit I have not investigated it further, does anybody have a take on this?

I am currently a freshman in college pursuing an engineering degree. However, I have felt passionate about working in finance/quant for a few years, and I think I am deciding to change my path.

I have a few choices. I can major in finance with an emphasis in financial investments. A quick look at the upper-level courses shows they have a class called ""portfolio management"" and ""investments,"" but it looks like the degree is littered with a bunch of general business classes (rather than programming).

My second option is a degree in Economics and Computational Analysis. The upper level classes include econometrics and other classes that teach quantitative methods rather than portfolio management. This degree REQUIRES a minor, and since I already have some engineering courses done, I can get a minor in Industrial and Systems engineering pretty easily. These classes include ""operations research,"" a few engineering stat classes, facilities design, etc. Also, since I have extra space in my schedule with this degree, I can take portfolio management and investments (after taking accounting prerequsites).

The second option seems like a well-rounded degree with some accounting, portfolio management, engineering, and quant experience whereas the first option seems like a straight-forward finance degree. The second degree looks miserably technical/difficult but I don't want that to be my main reason for not wanting to take that path.",2017-09-29,13,8

4gwpo3_PATH,PATH,The SPX Master Path - 4-28-2016,"Hey friends,

So it's come down to fulfill the things we've been preaching about the last few months. SPX took out the resistances one at a time on the way up (like in the videos we post) but at our ""The Top is In"" video we reiterated that the 2134 top was going to be the top for a while and today's post-BOJ, post-Fed clearly shows how quickly the market can deflate.  

So now I'm plotting out an approximate move for both bull and bear case [Here](http://imgur.com/3FiYLou)/ I'm labelling clearly the highest probability case for the decision point of bull or bear market with estimated timing.

We've been mentioning that bumping against a resistance that is from an ATH, and then just blasting through an ATH without a pull back first was such a low probability trade. Every hopeful bull in the world based a bull market on a 5 point a day trickle up to Fed day... for reasons I never understood. They believed we'd just walk right through a year long resistance and a $Trillion dollar wall with ease. But actually what it was, was shorts getting impatient and call buying to protect their stubborn positions. A little re-positioning to gamble on a rate hike (which we never got). So ""massive bull market going to ATH and beyond this month!"" Not at all. You can't decide bull market from the highs. That's not how trading works. 

The decision point is actually made at the first major dip, like the Anatomy of a Bull Market video I made a few months back. You have a bump against some resistance (c,b, or a from the videos) then a pull back first, and it's *then* where the pivot forms. At that dip (which is likely coming now over the next week or two) you will see the real volume of the bulls and bears fighting it out at which the market either flies to new ATH and beyond, or bounces down like a basketball falling down the stairs ending in an August/September crash to 1600. 

Either way you subscribe, as we said for months both the bull and bear case have shared trading paths, and this is it. The market isn't decided yet, and everything said now is just opinions, and nobody knows what the money will do at the pivot. The key points are highlighted in the chart with the most likely candidate being the 38.2% fib retrace, patterning after other dips in the last two years, which is a 2040 (assumed that 2070 is lost in the next few days). 

So for those of you with money out there in the market, invest wisely and understand that there is a lot of science and math behind the scenes of what most perceive as random. It's not. If it was, nobody would make consistent money ;)

Be safe out there, bulls and bears alike, because the REAL chop will come at 2040. Except it will be +/- 40-100 point moves, not +/- 10.

2eqxib_PATH,PATH,Guidance for 24 year old on the path to financial freedom,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to borrow some guidance for what path to take to achieve my goals of eventually owning a home and eventual financial freedom. 

- 24 y.o. in DC Metro Area making $65,000 annually 

- Taking advantage of 401K up to 6% employer match. Current balance is $10K

- $25K in savings, $8K in investments (will break these down below)

- $17K left in car payments, 1.99% interest rate (paying extra towards principal every month)

- Roughly $5K in student loans will begin to need payment in about 1 year (after graduation)

- Moving out from home in a week. Rent will be roughly $900 for my portion per month 

$8K in investments breakdown (rounded figures below):

- $4K in Vanguard 2050 Target Fund (not using for retirement, but rather as an easy diversified option for stocks/bonds)

- $1,100 in AAPL

- $700 in BBRY

- $900 in F

- $500 in FNMA 

- $900 in SGLB (my hail Mary stock pick)

- $100 in UNG

I've struggled with my stock choices and have not been able to make good gains consistently. I think I'd like to invest more in funds such as Vanguards. But, which ones?

I don't need $25K in cash sitting around. I think the best choice would be to invest most of it. But again, in which funds or where? I will own a home, but not for at least a few years so I can avoid PMI and also to stay mobile for the early stages of my career. 

Any advice out there? Thanks for reading. ",2014-08-27,31,34

zpw2b_PATH,PATH,is finance the right path to go for a fulfilling life? (background inside),"I've been thinking about this for a couple of years now.  I'm 25/M, currently work in wealth management, 65k+, mortgage a house, paid off car, currently pursuing my mba (nontarget GMAT 660), and am in a healthy relationship.  In paper everything sounds good.

In reality, like everyone, I work long hours and on free time I study for the MBA.  After the MBA come the CFA exams.  I have had no time to really enjoy leisure time, travel, parties, vacations, nothing.  I feel guilty when I put off anything work related.  Its become harder for me to enjoy simple things and I believe i'm falling victim to society's standards.  I've slowly alienated all my friends and family.  

What I do for a living doesn't seem to benefit society as it is very sales intensive with very little concern for client's outcome.  My question is, will this path lead to happiness?  Something I've been asking myself for a year now since I've become more familar with the industry...

EDIT:  Thanks for all your comments, looks like most of you have found happiness within finance.  I will continue to work hard.  Thanks.",2012-09-11,30,50

So if you don't know how education is organized in France, I'm doing the 2-year commerce preparation class (the most common way to get into any Grande Ecole) in order to get into HEC Paris or ESSEC Business school. There I'll follow a 3-year course for a master of Science in Management.

A double diploma with MIT Sloan is pretty hard to get from both schools. I know that the laws make it hard to get a job directly after a Master's degree in France. Except I have no idea where or how to pursue my education in the United States after the degree.
