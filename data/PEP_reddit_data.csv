1kaw8d7_PEP,PEP,PepsiCo: Time to Buy?,"Let's talk PepsiCo. You might think of them as a steady ship in choppy market waters, but lately, their shares have looked a bit flat. They've hit some recent lows and even missed earnings expectations for the first time in years, trimming their profit forecast for the year ahead. This has got investors wondering what's up with the drinks and snacks giant.

Turns out, it's a mix of issues. Pesky tariffs, especially one hitting the concentrate they bring in from Ireland for Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are biting into profits. Add general supply chain headaches and signs that shoppers are getting a bit wary of price hikes after years of inflation, and you see why the market's feeling jittery.

But hold on, this is still PepsiCo we're talking about. They're not just cola; their Frito-Lay snacks division is a massive global powerhouse, often carrying the load. Plus, they're a 'Dividend King', dishing out cash to shareholders for over half a century, with a nice ~4% yield right now.

They're not sitting idle either. Their 'pep+' strategy is pushing towards more sustainable practices and healthier options, aiming to future-proof the business. They're also banking on growth in international markets and adapting their snacks and drinks to keep up with changing tastes.

So, the big question is: are these current troubles just a short-term fizzle, or has the investment case gone permanently flat? Is it a chance to grab a slice of a solid company at a discount, or time to stand back until the storm clouds clear?

* Stock has pulled back from \~$190 to \~$130
* 53 straight years of dividend increases
* Fundamentals are still solid, no obvious collapse in the business

For options traders, it gets even more interesting:

* **IV Rank is 34.5**, which makes options premiums elevated,
* This could be a good setup for selling cash-secured puts, or even running the Wheel strategy if you want to build a position.

1jzt7p9_V,V,PepsiCo (PEP) - Good Opportunity or Value Trap?,"I've had me eye on PEP for a little bit and I'm (mostly) liking what I see. It's trading at a 25% discount from it's ATH ($196 v $146) and has a considerably lower P/E than it's rival Coca Cola (KO)  - (20.93 v 29.38) while arguably showing better growth (based on net income over 12 months). Additionally, it has a nice juicy dividend yield (3.7%).

On paper, it seems a fairly safe buy however my main concern is the tariffs China has put on US goods. PEP apparently derives 6% of its operating income from the Asian Pacific market and while there are no exact figures for just China I think its safe to say it will be the bulk.

Now, of course that 6% is hardly a material risk, but when a huge multi-global misses targets even a little bit it can have a very painful impact on the stock price. My concern is a loss of 6% is significant enough that even at current prices it's not a smart pick.

However, I am unsure and have somewhat limited knowledge of the company and its Asian operations even if there might be some exemption from China for food/beverages. As such, I thought I would put it to the board. Any thoughts?    ",2025-04-15,0,19

Pepsi is revising earnings down lately, but it’s still growing massively abroad. The company is ahead of the regulatory curve and has made smart acquisitions in health food brands. The stock is trading well below KO, despite operating in a similar market facing the same major challenges. 

KO has a bit of a better balance sheet, but PEP is quite a bit more diversified, so it’s not perfectly comparable. A lot of Pepsi’s debt is due to the aforementioned acquisitions. However, inflation reports are cooling, and many financial institutions are raising the probability of a recession. This raises the possibility of a rate cut, which is favorable to PEP’s balance sheet. 

Stock is trading near its 52-week low and is almost approaching 2020 levels of valuation. I feel that’s a great price for its assets and position as a historically great defensive stock. ",2025-04-11,6,4

1jdpo9l_NET,NET,"Pepsi (PEP) buys probiotic soda Poppi for $1.95 billion to expand their presence in the functional soda market, paying 13x+ topline revenue","**Shares of Pepsi closed 1.85% up today. Some information about Poppi, the acquisition target.**

\- Founded in 2018 by a couple, they reported upwards of $100 million in sales in 2024. Even if we round up to $150 million in sales, Pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit. Realistically 19.5x top line revenue on the $100 million reported if we don't use the rounded up $150 million figure.

\- The company previously appeared on Shark Tank and sold 25% of the business to Rohan Oza for a $400,000 investment. Rohan Oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as Vita Coco and Vitaminwater to market

\- The company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn

\- Poppi was previously sued in California class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks. With only 2g of fiber, a consumer would have to drink 4+ cans to ""realize any potential health benefits""

**Interested to hear what people think about this acquisition.**

\- Is Poppi overvalued and did Pepsi overpay?

\- Should Pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring? Does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management? It's hard to imagine that with Pepsi's scale in manufacturing, marketing, retail partnerships, etc. it have cost more than $1.95 billion to make a competing offering that could reach $100 million in sales within 6 years.

\- Naturally my next thought was, given the above on valuation, is the Poppi brand worth almost $2 billion? Maybe it's not the sales they are after, but the formulation, the brand, or the marketing partnerships.

\- Will Pepsi change the formula, leading to turning off long time customers?

1hyy2pm_GOOGL,GOOGL,Why I Think $RIME (SemiCab) Contract is with PepsiCo (Connecting the dots),"Based on the recent announcement by Algorhythm Holdings, their subsidiary SemiCab has signed a pilot program with a $200 billion global consumer packaged goods (CPG) company. While the name of the company wasn’t disclosed, I believe it’s highly likely to be PepsiCo, and here’s why.

PepsiCo’s current market cap is approximately $200 billion, which aligns perfectly with the size of the unnamed client mentioned in the article. Additionally, PepsiCo is one of the largest global players in the CPG industry, with a massive logistics network that relies heavily on efficient freight management. A Google search reveals that PepsiCo spends over $2.2 billion annually on freight, making them a prime candidate for SemiCab’s AI-powered logistics platform, which aims to reduce costs and improve trucking efficiency.

The contract focuses on optimizing logistics and supply chains, which is a critical area for PepsiCo given its scale and geographic reach. PepsiCo frequently engages in partnerships to enhance its supply chain efficiency, and a pilot program like this fits their operational strategy. The scale of PepsiCo’s freight spend also matches the opportunity described in the announcement, where SemiCab could deliver significant cost savings and operational improvements.

If not PepsiCo, the client is likely a similarly sized CPG company with a $200 billion market cap and heavy freight spending. However, based on the clues given and PepsiCo’s logistics profile, it seems to be the most plausible match.

For reference, Google “Pepsi market cap” to verify the $200 billion valuation and “how much does Pepsi spend on freight” to find the $2.2 billion freight spend. These details help connect the dots and strongly point toward PepsiCo as the likely company involved in this partnership.

Edit: This is just informational speculation post and not financial advice.

1hj94ea_PEP,PEP,Is PEP a screaming buy here? ,"Currently trading at April 2022 lows. 3.5% yield which is historically high for Pepsi. Well diversified and safe haven if things eventually turn south. PEP dividend is now almost the same as some HYSA yields. I know the RFK shadow is out there but I honestly don't think it's going to be as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. Some changes will be made but a company like pep is so massive I'm sure whatever is made they are ready to absorb it and find a way to deal with it to little impact to the bottom line. 

One thing I think Pepsi could do is a 3 for 1 stock split to bring the share price around 50 which would put it balance with KO and drive more retail investing. 

Another potential interesting thought is they acquire CELH. The two are already partners and CELH value has come way down from its peak. CELH has a cult like following of both investors and customers. Bringing them into the fold would drive a lot more growth interest to a ""boring"" company.

With a market cap of $230 billion and a hefty debt load of $73 billion, [Pepsi's 3% dividend yield](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/PEP/dividends) consumed a staggering 95% of its free cash flow last year. This raises the question: is this dividend sustainable in the long run?



While Pepsi has shown consistent profit margins around 10% and decent returns on invested capital, the revenue growth has been relatively flat, hovering in the low single digits. The video also highlighted that even though Pepsi is a well-known brand, its growth potential seems limited compared to competitors like Monster Beverage.



Given these factors, do you think Pepsi's dividend is at risk if the company faces any financial headwinds? How do you view the balance between dividends and reinvestment in a company like PepsiCo? Would love to hear your thoughts!",2024-10-11,135,51

1e16f05_PEP,PEP,This Soda is About to Pop / $PEP Pepsico,"A bunch of household defensive names are at 52-week lows. This includes things like Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers and Pepsico.

The AI hype has relegated defensive stocks to the dustbin, but this is about to change in a big way.

July is historically the strongest month in the summer for tech and it also has the highest statistical odds for the NASDAQ to form a multi-month market top.

Today's big sell-off in tech, in reaction to better than expected inflation report, may seem illogical but it actually was predictable. This AI led tech rally flew too close to the sun and it's getting a little crispy here.

This is by no means the end of the tech rally, but it's a clear signal that big money is rotating money out of tech and into these beaten down defensives. Especially as we enter the seasonally bearish time of the year in any year, but particularly bearish in election years. The fall.

This is no secret, hedge funds have been [dumping tech stocks at a record rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/hedge-funds-are-selling-tech-stocks-aggressively-goldman-says) in recent weeks ahead of this CPI read, and who's been buying? Retail.

https://preview.redd.it/n3v4d0u9zzbd1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe83c62d4f343f2f6d5d5dd3a4a6fcac8718b083

So what's the deal with $PEP, why is it a good deal here?  
1- The stock is at 52-week lows, but fundamentally the company is still growing and beating estimates.  
2- There's a defensive rotation starting right now, that happens every year but is especially pronounced in election years and if you catch it early you can make so much money.  
3- The stock has flashed a couple of very strong technical buy signals. It is now at a major supporting trendline, where the stock bottomed twice before. In the late 2018 market correction and in the COVID crash.  
It's at this support trendline again right now.

Just trading at a trendline is not enough on its own to trigger a buy signal. This is where you have to look for other clues that big money is buying and we have plenty of those here.  Sector rotation trackers have been showing that big money has been selling tech and buying staples in anticipation of bearish end of summer into fall seasonality. The stock also formed a double bottom with a bullish divergence. A historically powerful bottoming signal. That indicates stronger conviction by investors at these levels.

A simple mean reversion, to the middle of $PEP's historical uptrend would mean a rally to $190+ before the end of the year. And because $PEP is a low volatility name, options are cheap. Meaning the stock doesn't have to move up much for you to make money hand over first with calls.

1cb1s86_PEP,PEP,PepsiCo earnings beat estimates as international demand boosts sales ,"PepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations, despite a recall of some Quaker Foods cereal and bars that dented U.S. volume.

Shares of the company were down less than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.61 adjusted vs. $1.52 expected

Revenue: $18.25 billion vs. $18.07 billion expected

Pepsi reported first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.04 billion, or $1.48 per share, up from $1.93 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Pepsi earned $1.61 per share.

Net sales rose 2.3% to $18.25 billion. The company’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2.7% in the quarter.

But the company’s volume is still under pressure. Pepsi, along with many of its rivals, has seen its volume fall in response to higher prices for its Gatorade, Fritos and other products in its portfolio.

The company’s food division saw its volume decrease 0.5%, while its beverage segment reported flat volume. The metric strips out pricing and currency changes to reflect demand.

A recall of many Quaker Foods cereals and bars only worsened Pepsi’s volume problem. The company issued the first recall for potential salmonella contamination in December, then widened it in January. The North American Quaker Food division reported that its volume cratered 22% in the quarter. The Quaker Foods recall dented Pepsi’s organic volume by roughly 1%.

Pepsi will officially close a Quaker Oats plant tied to the recalls in June, although production there has already ceased. Pepsi said that the company has resumed limited production of certain products affected by the recalls.

Pepsi’s other North American divisions also reported weaker volume. Volume in its beverage unit fell 5% in the quarter, while Frito-Lay North America reported a 2% decline in its volume.

Outside of the U.S., demand was stronger. Its Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China region reported 12% volume growth for snacks. Even in Europe, which has also struggled with higher grocery prices, beverage volume increased 7% and snack volume rose 2%.

Pepsi also reiterated its 2024 outlook. For the full year, the company is expecting organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%.

“As we look ahead, we continue to expect a normalization and moderation in category growth rates versus the last few years,” Pepsi executives said in prepared remarks. “We also continue to expect that consumers will remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases.”

 on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as North American demand for its food and drinks weakened.

CEO Ramon Laguarta said that U.S. sales broadly slowed down in the fourth quarter.

“Part of that is a slowdown due to pricing and [consumers’] disposable income situation,” he told investors on the company’s conference call.

He added that U.S. consumers are also shifting their behavior from eating and drinking at home to picking up more of their snacks and Gatorade from convenience stores. But Laguarta expressed optimism about the overall state of the consumer, citing low unemployment and hopes that interest rates will fall by the summer and wages will rise faster than inflation.

Shares of the company fell 3% in morning trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.78 adjusted vs. $1.72 expected

Revenue: $27.85 billion vs. $28.4 billion expected


Pepsi reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.3 billion, or 94 cents per share, up from $518 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the food and beverage giant earned $1.78 per share.

Net sales dropped less than 1% to $27.85 billion. It’s the first quarter since 2020 that the company’s quarterly revenue has declined compared with the year-ago period. Currency exchange rates dragged net sales down by 1.5%.

Pepsi’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4.5% in the quarter, helped by higher prices. But those same raised prices have hurt demand for the company’s food and drinks. Pepsi’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, slid again this quarter.

PepsiCo executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings have squeezed consumers’ budgets, particularly in North America, in prepared remarks released ahead of the company’s conference call. They also said consumers are increasingly choosing smaller pack sizes for convenience and their low price points.

Pepsi’s North American Quaker Foods division reported an 8% decline in volume. A voluntary recall of its granola bars and cereals hurt its sales during the quarter, along with weaker growth for the overall category.

Frito-Lay North America, which includes brands like Cheetos and Doritos, posted a 2% drop in volume.

Pepsi’s North American beverage unit saw its volume fall 6% in the quarter.

For 2024, Pepsi now anticipates organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%. The company previously forecast an increase in organic revenue on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.

“Consumers are likely to remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases,” Pepsi executives said in the prepared remarks.

Pepsi is predicting a weaker first half of the year as product recalls dent its North American Quaker Oats business and international conflicts hurt sales in some regions. Executives are expecting international organic revenue growth to top that of North America for the full year.

18hmrvy_PEP,PEP,PepsiCo Had a Rough 2023. Expect 20% Returns for 2024.,"PepsiCo (PEP) is down 7%YTD. But using the strategy of sector rotation, Omega Trades sees this stock as the hottest pick for 2024.

Let's look into why PepsiCo has been down recently, and why this has led to an undervaluation.

PepsiCo (PEP) had a challenging 2023, as will be discussed. This decrease primarily stems from market sentiment rather than fundamental weaknesses. The rejection of consumer-staples stocks, including Pepsi, during the S&P 500's rally post-2022's bear market, along with higher bond yields and concerns over weight-loss drugs impacting snacking habits, have contributed to this sentiment.

&#x200B;

**The Resilience of Pepsi**

However, as 2023 concludes, sentiments might be on the verge of a shift. The reduction in bond yields and growing concerns about economic growth may redirect attention to staples, potentially making them an essential asset once again. Additionally, Pepsi's anticipated growth is set to accelerate as investments made in the last five years start to yield returns. Analysts' sentiments support Pepsi's resilience, considering it a durable business likely to outperform in risk-off environments and to compound earnings ahead of peers.The concerns surrounding weight-loss drugs impacting Pepsi's snack business might be overstated, as indicated by industry experts. Companies in the packaged-foods sector view the volume-related worries linked to weight-loss drugs as exaggerated and foresee no immediate negative impact on their businesses.

&#x200B;

**New Products, New Strategy, New Revenue**

Pepsi has strategically begun diversifying its product offerings towards healthier options by reducing package sizes, introducing zero-sugar beverages, and acquiring brands focused on health and wellness products. Leveraging its global distribution network, Pepsi aims to market these products to consumers who previously preferred traditional snacks.Despite a slight decrease in product volumes, Pepsi has implemented high-single-digit price increases, resulting in almost 9% sales growth in the first three quarters of the year. The company anticipates a 4.6% growth in total revenue next year, with a marginal increase in demand and volumes.With approximately $60 billion in investments made since 2018, Pepsi foresees profit margins expanding in the upcoming year. Operating margins are expected to rise, and earnings per share are estimated to climb around 8% to $8.15 next year, reflecting an attractive valuation compared to the S&P 500.Furthermore, Pepsi's status as a Dividend Aristocrat with a consistent payout history spanning 51 years offers a 3% yield, increasingly appealing in the current falling yield environment.

&#x200B;

**Summary: Why Pepsi is a Buy**

Considering PepsiCo's strategic diversification towards healthier products, anticipation of sales growth, expected rise in profit margins, and attractive valuation compared to the market indices, analysts' sentiments largely favor a positive outlook for the company.The enduring nature of PepsiCo's business, coupled with its consistent dividend payouts, renders it an appealing asset for investors seeking growth and stability in their portfolios. If the company continues on its trajectory, potential gains of up to 12% to 21% might be achievable based on analysts' estimates and historical trading multiples.PepsiCo appears positioned to rebound from the challenges of 2023, offering a compelling investment opportunity for those interested in a combination of growth potential and stability in the market.

Net sales rose 6.7% to $23.45 billion. The company’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 8.8% in the quarter.  


But PepsiCo’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter. Pepsi’s price hikes to mitigate inflation have weakened demand for its products. The company has also been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to drive more transactions, Pepsi executives told analysts on a conference call. That strategy results in more affordable options for consumers — and lower volume sold.  


Pepsi’s North American beverages unit reported volume declines of 6%. CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has pruned some promotions, such as for its bottled water business, in order to preserve margins. But those deals drove volume for the drinks, gains that disappeared without the promotions.  


There were some bright spots in beverages. Gatorade, for example, saw double-digit revenue growth. The company also plans to relaunch Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a fan favorite flavor that is available only at Taco Bell.  


The company’s North American food divisions performed better than the beverages unit did. Quaker Foods North America’s volume rose 1%, while Frito-Lay North America’s volume was flat. Quaker Foods’ brands also gained market share in key categories, such as pancake mix and syrup, executives said in prepared remarks.  


Looking to 2024, Pepsi anticipates organic revenue growth on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.",2023-10-12,25,6

172yq1k_KO,KO,PEP vs KO: some questions about evaluating companies,"I am trying to educate myself a bit about evaluating companies. I have been finding out about the balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement. To get a bit of a hang of the metrics that come from these, I am now comparing 2 industry giants: Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

The numbers below are from a 2006 - TTM timeframe. For example: between 2006 and today (TTM), PEP revenue grew 146%:

||PEP|KO|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dividend CAGR|8.34|2.08|
|Dividend Yield|2.9|3.4|
|MarketCap|142|143|
|Revenue|146|79|
|Revenue CAGR|5.37|3.42|
|Net Income|41|107|
|FCF|43|109|

I have a few questions about these numbers:

* PEP seems to be the stronger company, with a revenue that grew a lot more than KO's. However, where PEP net income only grew 41%, KO's grew 107%. What is -generally speaking- the meaning of this? Does it mean that KO is running a much more efficient operation?
* Marketcap of both companies grew basically the same: up \~140% over the last 17 years. But revenue growth of PEP is a lot bigger than KO's. Would that mean that either KO is overvalued right now, or PEP undervalued (compared to one another)?",2023-10-08,4,3

That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then.

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

[Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%.

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.  
  
So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment.

That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings 

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then.

Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke. While Pepsi looks like the better technical buy, it looks overvalued from a fundamental standpoint. **Coke looks like a much better buy in terms of valuation**. However, if I have to be honest, neither of these offers much in the way of margin of safety! I mean, both of these companies have a forward PE that resembles Google, but neither of these have the growth opportunities that Google has. I'm not saying that you should be comparing Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola because they are obviously extremely different. However, it is obvious that Coca Cola and Pepsi have a massive safety premium attached to them and that limits your potential profit. Plus, the current 2.8% or 3% dividend yield is nothing to be excited about. You could make a case for Pepsi given their dividend growth rate, but the price makes me think twice. I personally don't have any positions in either of these and I don't think I'll be buying soon unless they somehow drop by 20%. 

That's my 2 cents. What do you think? Yay or nay on Coke / Pepsi? If so, why?

16kypdq_PEP,PEP,Coca Cola ($KO) vs Pepsi ($PEP): Are Either Worth Buying Right Now?,"Coke or Pepsi? These two companies have dominated the soft drinks industry for over a century. Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that [some argue they have shaped modern marketing](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coke-vs-pepsi-rivalry-brand-marketing-metaverse/621711/). Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, [it's hard to say that today](https://awario.com/blog/coke-vs-pepsi-analysis/). Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that [Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/why-did-warren-buffett-invest-heavily-cocacola-ko-late-1980s.asp) and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, [making up almost 7% of his portfolio](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#tabholdings_tab_link). Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke? Or, would you choose Pepsi instead?

Historically, [Pepsi's total return has been higher than Coca Cola's](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%252CPEP%26interval%3DMAX%26metric%3DtotalReturn%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). That's been the case in the last 30 years, the last 10 years, the last 5 years, 3 years, 1 year, even year-to-date. Does this mean Pepsi is the better choice or was Coke just unlucky? Let's take a look at the latest earnings.

# Latest Earnings

At the end of July, [Coca Cola beat earnings estimates by 8.3%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3991061-coca-cola-non-gaap-eps-of-0_78-beats-0_06-revenue-of-12b-beats-250m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), but their revenue fell short of expectations despite growing 6.2% from the previous year. For the financial year, Coke expected revenue growth of 8 to 9% with earnings increasing 9 to 11%. They also expect a solid free cash flow of $9.5 billion compared to the $7.8 billion they had last year. Meanwhile, [Pepsi beat earnings estimates by 6.6%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3987312-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-2_09-beats-0_13-revenue-of-22_32b-beats-590m%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and revenue estimates by 2.7% while showing a revenue increase of 10.3% as compared to last year. Pepsi also increased their guidance. They now expect a 10% growth in revenue and a 10% increase in core EPS, $0.15 cent above the consensus. Despite the good news, Pepsi's stock price did not move a lot and is actually down almost 5% since then.

# Valuation Metrics

Pepsi seems to have done better in their recent earnings than Coke, but what about the fundamentals and the valuation? Both companies are on the expensive side. [Coke has a slightly lower forward non-GAAP PE of 22](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), whereas [Pepsi stands at 24](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fvaluation%2Fmetrics%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). However, Pepsi has better growth expectations, putting their PEG at 3 whereas Coke stands at 3.4. Coke has a higher Price-to-Sales of 5.6 compared to 2.7 for Pepsi, but then Pepsi has a higher book value of 13 compared to Coke's 9.6.

# Margins

The small difference in the valuation comes down to profitability and growth expectations. [Coke has higher net and free cash flow margins](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) than [Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fprofitability%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) which is why the PS ratio is higher. It also seems that Coca Cola's margins are more stable than Pepsi's, at least in the last 5 years. To me, that's a big plus and I think this is a big part of why investors like Coca Cola. Stability is key and people pay a premium for that.

# Capital Structure

The capital structure of Pepsi and Coke is extremely similar in terms of market cap and debt. Both have a market cap of \~$250B and debts of \~$44B. The only difference here is that Coke ($15.7B) has double the cash of Pepsi ($6.45B).

However, Pepsi pays a higher interest than Coke with $600 million in net interest expenses versus Coke's $400 million. This puts Coke in a better light although honestly the difference is not that big. Their earnings before interest and taxes are almost identical at $12.6 billion and that covers the interest more than 20 times over so it's nothing to worry about. The financials are safe and secure.

Since that's the case, let's look at how Pepsi and Coke return value to shareholders. [Pepsi has been a lot more active with share repurchases](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DPEP%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) (and Buffett himself is a big fan of share repurchases!). You can see the steady trend here over the last 10 years. Pepsi's outstanding shares went down from 1.53 to 1.38 billion, a reduction of 10% or 1% every single year. In comparison, [Coke only bought back 2.2% of their shares](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fcharting%3Fcompare%3DKO%26interval%3D10Y%26metric%3Dtotal_common_shares_outstanding_ecs%26source%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Their share count was 4.42 billion in 2013 and is currently just 4.32 billion. In fact, we can see that their shares started going up over the last 5 years! Buying back shares is linked to a growth in share price and this could explain why Pepsi's stock price has been doing better than Coke.

# Dividends

Coke does have [a better dividend of 3.2%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D). Even though the 5-year growth rate is only 3.4%, Coca Cola has been increasing it every year since 1963! The payout ratio is a bit high at 70% and that's not great. However, Coke is financially stable. Their earnings are also meant to growth by around 10% so I think the dividend is safe and can keep growing. I don't see any issues although Coke should really focus more on share buybacks. One of the side benefits there is that the total dividend payments get reduced that way because there's just less shares to pay dividends on. This also allows the company to grow its dividend faster.

That's exactly what we see with Pepsi. [Pepsi has a lower dividend yield of 2.8%](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fdividends%2Fscorecard%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D), that's true. But, the growth rate is two times higher than Coke's at 6.9%. Pepsi has also increased dividends for 50 years so they have officially joined the American dividend kings list. Pepsi's payout ratio is relatively high at 65%, only 5% less than Coca Cola. However, I don't think the dividend or the growth rate is threatened as Pepsi is financially stable and is growing earnings at close to 10%.

At this point guys, I have to tell you that I did not expect Pepsi and Coca Cola to be this similar. I knew they would be close, but ***they are almost identical***. The main difference I see here is that Coca Cola has higher, more stable margins, whereas Pepsi is growing a bit faster, it's raising dividends more and is buying back more shares.

# Technical Analysis

Now, a quick technical analysis (I would add a screenshot, but you can't really do that here, sorry). I think Pepsi wins here by a large margin. You can see the steady bullish trend in Pepsi's price. They have dropped in the last 4 months, but the 100-day simple-moving average has been a good level of support for the stock price. It was retested in the first week of September and so far, Pepsi hasn't closed below it. I think that's a good sign. In comparison, Coke hasn't been doing too well. It's down 10% since May and is actually trading below the pre-COVID levels. Unlike Pepsi, there is no clear established bullish trend. Coca Cola's price peaked in April of 2022. Since then, we've see this wedge pattern form. To me, it looks Coca Cola's price is heading down for the 200-day simple average at $56. If it breaks it, then next stop is $54 dollars and so on.

# Price Targets

My personal valuation models put Coca Cola's fair price at somewhere between $61.5 and $68.4 with the exception of the Gordon Growth model which puts it at $50. Given the current price of $58, that's somewhere between a 6% and 18% potential upside. The [Wall Street consensus for the price of Coca Cola is $69.7 dollars](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FKO%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) and a 20.3% upside so they are clearly more optimistic than me. On the high side, they see $76 dollars, on the low side they see $60 dollars.

On the other hand, my models put Pepsi at somewhere between $127.7 and $196 dollars with The Gordon Growth model looking too optimistic at $222. That's a massive difference and the reason behind that is Pepsi's free cash flow. Even though Pepsi grows faster than Coca Cola, their free cash flow margin is half as big. That's why the discounted cash flow model ends up with such a low fair value for Pepsi, almost 30% below the fair price. Value investing is all about buying at a discount so I can't say that Pepsi is really trading at a good price right now. [Wall Street disagrees with me and puts a target price of $197.5 dollars on Pepsi](https://www.sahg6dtr.com/21WPXRQ/R74QP/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fsymbol%2FPEP%2Fratings%2Fsell-side-ratings%3Fsource%3Daffiliate_program%253A%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3D%257Baffiliate_name%257D%26affid%3D%257Baffiliate_id%257D%26oid%3D%257Boffer_id%257D%26transaction%3D%257Btransaction_id%257D) with a 10% upside. On the low side, they see $156 dollars which is closer to my valuation, and on the high side they see $220 like the Gordon Growth model.

# Final Verdict

Now, what's the verdict here? To me, it looks like **the market is more optimistic about Pepsi than Coke**. This could be because of the higher growth rates, the earnings beat or simply because share buybacks add up. There is no question that Pepsi has a better momentum than Coke.

[PepsiCo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PEP/) (PEP) – The snack and beverage maker reported an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.97 per share, 13 cents above estimates, with revenue also topping forecasts.

ta6jlt_KO,KO,"McDonalds's, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks exit Russia","McDonald's which has come to symbolize Russia opening up to the West post-Soviet Union, announced Tuesday that they will be shuttering their 850 locations in Russia. Of these brands, it takes the biggest financial hit. 9% of its global revenue comes from Russia, and they will continue to pay the salaries of about 62,000 workers.

**In recent days**, Pepsi, Coke, McDonald’s and Starbucks have drawn criticism for continuing to operate in Russia while other U.S. companies backed out and paused sales.

* **Yale Professor** Jeffrey Sonnenfeld compiled and made public a list of U.S. companies that have withdrawn from Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion — and those that hadn’t. Until Tuesday afternoon, Coke was among the most recognizable names on the spreadsheet.
* **“Our hearts** are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” Coke said in a brief statement Tuesday afternoon. “We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.”

Russia is one of the few places worldwide where PepsiCo has a larger presence. In a regulatory filing, Coke said its business in Ukraine and Russia contributed about 1% to 2% of its consolidated net operating revenue and operating income in 2021.

Pepsi has sold its cola in Russia for more than six decades, even when the company had to trade its soda concentrate for Stolichnaya vodka and warships. McDonald’s opened its first location beyond the Iron Curtain in Moscow months before the Soviet Union collapsed.

**Pepsi generates 4% of its annual revenue** in Russia. They will discontinue selling beverages, capital investments, and all advertising and promotional activities. They will keep selling some essential products, like baby formula, milk and baby food in the country.

**What they're saying:** “As a food and beverage company, now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,” PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote in a memo to employees viewed by CNBC.

* **The Wall Street Journal** reported earlier on Tuesday that Pepsi was weighing different options for its Russian business, including writing off its value. Economic sanctions have complicated the process of offloading Russian assets.
* **Yale’s Sonnenfeld** makes the case for companies ceasing operations in Russia Since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, many U.S. companies have looked to reduce their exposure in both Russia and Ukraine. Some restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, have sold off some of their company-owned locations to local franchisees.

**Starbucks** went a step further than McDonald’s, saying it would suspend all Russian business activity, including shipment of its products. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson condemned the attacks in a letter on Friday.

snvs29_PEP,PEP,"PepsiCo Raises Dividend, Marches Toward Dividend King Status","PepsiCo is raising its dividend once again 
PepsiCo will be increasing its quarterly dividend per share to $1.075, payable on March 31, 2022, for shareholders as of March 4, 2022. That will be a 5% increase from the dividend in the same period a year ago and consistent with PepsiCo's announcement that it will increase its annual dividend to $4.30 from $4.09. Since the pandemic's onset, the company has thrived as billions of folks spend more time at home where they have more opportunities to reach for snacks and beverages.

The dividend increase is part of a long trend. Between 2011 and 2020, PepsiCo investors saw their dividends per share nearly double from from $2.03 to $4.02. Those gains came despite PepsiCo's difficulty in growing earnings, which expanded at a compound rate of just 2.7% in that same time. As a result, PepsiCo's dividend payout ratio increased over the years to reach 70.5% most recently. While on the high side, it is still manageable.

A dividend payout ratio above 100% is unsustainable as that means a company is paying more in dividends than it is earning in net profits. In that case, the excess over 100% is coming from either savings or borrowing, which are unsustainable sources in the long run. That said, existing shareholders should expect only a modest dividend increase in the near term from PepsiCo until or if it can unlock more robust earnings growth.

Still, PepsiCo's stock pays a healthy dividend yield of 2.46%. Combined with gains in the stock price, it has delivered respectable shareholder returns. Interestingly, after struggling to grow revenue for the first half of the decade, PepsiCo accelerated growth in the past four years. In 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, PepsiCo increased revenue by 1.2%, 1.8%, 3.9%, and 4.8%, respectively. If it can sustain the momentum for the next several years, it could give earnings a boost and further fuel increases in dividends to shareholders. 

What this could mean for PepsiCo stock 
Reaching the 50-year milestone may give PepsiCo stock a home among income-seeking investors who prefer Dividend Kings. The status is proof that the company can sustain and grow dividend payments through good times and bad as a company will have encountered a myriad of challenges over that period. The most discerning dividend investors can place PepsiCo on their list of income stocks to consider.",2022-02-08,79,22

**$PEP – Pepsi Co. Stock Analysis:**

*Company Overview:*

$PEP – Pepsi Co. is a leading global food and beverage company. Pepsi has a large portfolio of brands, with some of their biggest being Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana, and Quaker.

***Investment Information:***

*Recent SEC Filings:*

In this section, I will summarize Pepsi’s 7 most recent SEC filings to help you get an idea of what is currently going on in their business.

· The board of directors elected Edith W. Cooper as an audit committee member (effective Sept. 1st 2021) which comes with a stock reward.

· Pepsi “redeemed” their 1.7% Senior Notes due 2021

· David Flavel (Pepsi Co Executive VP) purchased 2,000 shares of $PEP stock for an average price of $154.39, resulting in a total expenditure of $308,780.

· PepsiCo raised their Full-Year Guidance in their most recent 10-Q filing.

*Competitors:*

· **$KO – Coca-Cola:** Coca-Cola is a beverage (water, sports drink, juice, dairy, tea/coffee, concentrates, syrups, and energy drinks) company that manufactures, markets and sells their beverages to their customers worldwide. Coca-Cola is Pepsi closest competitor in terms of general operations and relative size.

· **$MNST – Monster Beverages:** Monster beverages develops, markets, and sells their energy drink beverages and concentrates to their customers worldwide. Monster sells their products to grocery chains, wholesalers, membership stores, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, and e-commerce retailers.

· **$KDP: Keurig Dr Pepper:** Keurig Dr Pepper operates as a beverage company domestically and internationally. The Keurig side of their business pertains to the manufacturing, and selling of their coffee systems, packaged beverages, and beverage concentrates. The Dr. Pepper side of their business involves the manufacturing, and selling of their various beverage brands, beverage concentrates, vegetable juices, and water.

· **$FIZZ – National Beverage:** National Beverage develops, produces, markets, and sells their waters, juices, energy drinks, and soft drinks in the USA and Canada.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Pepsi increased their net revenues by 5%, and their gross profit by 4%.

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Pepsi’s operating profit decreased by 2%, their cost of goods sold increased by 5.5%, their net income decreased by 3%, and their EPS decreased by 2%.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, Pepsi increased their net revenues by 12%, increased their gross profit by 5%, and their net income (before tax) by 7%.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, Pepsi increased their cost of goods sold by 15% (more than the increase in net revenues, which leads to decreasing profit margins), decreased their net income by 3%, and held their Net income attributable to PepsiCo constant.

· **Option Exercising:** In 2020, approximately 4M common shares were exercised as part of option contracts. These 4M shares had a dilutionary effect of 0.3%.

· **Share Repurchases:** In 2020, Pepsi repurchased 15M common shares, which increase the value of each previously existing share by roughly 1%. Considering the hardships that many businesses faced during 2020, seeing Pepsi have a net shares outstanding decrease YoY is something to be excited about.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing Pepsi’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following:

*ROE:*

Based off of Pepsi’s ROE in comparison to their competitors, $PEP should be valued at $247/share, which would imply a share price increase of 63%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*D/E Ratio:*

Pepsi’s D/E ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $60/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 61%. This is very low, so I decided to take another comparable into consideration.

*P/E Ratio:*

Pepsi’s P/E ratio indicates that their fair value is $169/share, which would translate into an upside of 11%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Based off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $158.64/share, which would imply an increase of 4.2%. This indicates that Pepsi is very close to their fair value.

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $PEP stock of $149/share, whichb implies a potential downside risk to this investment of 2.5%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that Pepsi is sitting at/around their fair value.

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with Pepsi’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 3 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find Pepsi’s fair value to be $162/share, which implies an upside of 6%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that Pepsi is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $PEP stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $PEP stock of $156.44/share, which implies an upside of 2.5%.

***Risks:***

· **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Many of the supplies and raw materials that Pepsi uses to make their products are sourced from countries that are experiencing some sorts of political instability, civil unrest, or poor economic conditions. Some of Pepsi’s raw materials are sourced from a single/few supplier(s) that may not be able to keep up with Pepsi’s demand. However, Pepsi has increased their guidance, which shows that they are expecting to continue their growth, and they do not view this as a probable event.

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking), and their net income has been steadily decreasing during these timeframes. If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, Penn reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net revenues and gross profits have both been steadily increasing (which is good), however $PEP can take this to the next level by breaking the downward trend of their net incomes. It will be performances like these that compel Pepsi to keep increasing their guidance and excite their investors.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, Pepsi has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital.

Why $PEP, a boring ass boomer stock? Well, a few reasons. Firstly, earlier this month Pepsi announced that they would have a quarterly dividend of $1.0225 a share, a 7% increase versus the comparable year-ago period. If you own the stock by March 3rd, and hold it through the end of the month, you get paid.

Cool dude, I can get four dollars and nine cents a share per year when I just lost five figures diamond holding GME. Yeah, it's a boomer thing to care about, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm excited to get my $57.26 in late March for my common shares. And I'm betting a lot of risk averse bears like myself are thinking the same way. Google best dividend stocks - Pepsi comes up frequently. All these boomer money managers are going to want to show some cash in their clients accounts - they're moving over to Pepsi.

You're probably thinking I'm an idiot for believing I'm the first person to consider that stocks might rise before a dividend payout. Clearly the market will account for this and price it in beforehand. I'm not outsmarting Wall St. However, I do believe there might be extra pressures this year that just might not be accounted for. We're all a little nervous in this market. Money flew to travel stocks today and out of tech. But once travel stocks take their profits, I think dividend stocks will seem extra comfortable.

In addition, $PEP has been a little unloved lately, despite surviving COVID just fine and slightly beating earnings estimates. Their forecast was boring and nothing special, just like it should be for the company, but in this insane tech valuation market Wall St has sent the stock in a slow sell off. I don't understand technicals, but it looks like the stock is potentially oversold, and that most of the sellers are now out of the game, and dividend buyers are ready to jump back in:

So why the strike prices and dates I've chose? I don't really know. Perhaps March 5 would maximize profits. I'm mostly being a nit on this one, as I have no idea what I'm doing.",2021-02-22,17,24

l72an6_PEP,PEP,Read this if you need a pep talk.,"Look at it this way: You are on a rocket. 🚀 it might be bumpy but you will get there. If you cannot financially afford drops and it will drastically impact your life (ex. you used your credit card for huge amounts and you can’t pay rent if this does not pan out) then I understand your need to be paper handed and pull out. Always assess your own risk tolerance and do your due diligence. However, if you choose keep the momentum going just remember there are plenty of strong women and gentleman doing the same. Several people are willing to take the risk for a company they believe in, it’s up to you to decide if that risk is worth it for you. Many retail investors are not as misinformed as talking heads continue to incorrectly assume ( and you know what they say about assuming.) To succeed in anything, you must believe. Hedgefunds can be greedy and bet against a company all they want but there are several people passionate for a company’s success. It is hypocritical to impose restrictions on one side and not the other, retail investors deserve the same right as hedge funds to spend their money. Keep in mind: average people such as myself don’t have financial institutions to bail us out. People are investing their hard earned cash in a market primarily catering to millionaires/billionaires. The hypocrisy in who can come up big versus who will get harshly regulated is absurd, unethical and borderline illegal. 2008 damaged the lives of so many people. I wish I could do my part to help back then but alas I was too young at the time. Here we are 13 years later. I didn’t forget the pain that was brought to millions of people. Several of us are being strong and fighting for our families, friends and strangers who were undeservingly wronged by higher institutions. Several of us don’t want to see another company suffer due to irrational hedgefund attacks. How is it fair for these money-hungry monsters to act how they are, get bailed out and continue to instill fear in retail traders? How is it fair that several trading platforms are silencing the voices of retail investors who don’t have billions of dollars in funds to bail them out? You came this far and took the initial leap for a reason. It is time for you to decide if you will allow yourself to be scared or fight harder. The choice is yours at the end of the day. I think it’s beautiful that normal people are so passionate about a company. Example in mind: GameStop. I view this as symbolism. Large institutions have treated people like toys and let millions suffer to relentlessly line their own pockets out of greed. It is time for this ridiculous GAME to STOP. GME motto is: power to the players. Let’s bring back power to the real players- the players who are risking it all, the players who have been harshly affected for years, the players who don’t have millions or billions in funds to bail them out. The players who were treated as worthless time and time again- cheers to those players, cheers to you, cheers to us. Power to the REAL players. These unethical institutions do not need all the power they are hoarding. Sharing is caring, after all. For those of you who are following along on this crazy bumpy ride, I hope you continue to manifest positive thoughts and stay strong in your passion and belief. Passion is energy and you are stronger thank you think, do not EVER forget that. Please keep in mind this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock. 


TLDR: Several retail investors are internally strong and awesome overall. Passion is energy and you are stronger than you think. I really like GME stock. Video games are fun.",2021-01-28,27,4
l5itwq_PEP,PEP,Thoughts on Pepsico (PEP)?,"I've never taken too close of a look at Pepsico in the past, but did today and got thinking. 

The part that intrigues me is Pepsico compared it to Coke (KO), who I would say is their #1 competition. Pepsico has a market cap of  $195b and a P/E of 28, while Coke is at $210b and 25. Coke also has a slightly higher dividend and is still down from pre-covid levels, but the part that got me intrigued was the growth potential of Pepsico. Pepsi owns a lot more brands than Coke, including several popular snack brands, and continues to innovate for the future. Pepsi has a goal to reach zero net carbon emissions by 2040 and with the beyond meat deal today, they clearly have a vision of continued expansion. Plus, the diversification into the snacks industry, through brands like Frito Lay, Tostitos, and Quaker, just adds to their portfolio and growth potential. 

I wanted to see everyone else's thoughts on Pepsico as a dividend plus potential capital gains play. I could very well see this stock having a higher market cap than Coke within the next 5 years. And even if Pepsico doesn't have the best growth over the next few years, it will still be a very solid dividend stock.",2021-01-26,16,21

""We cannot understand the actions of the directors in that they know we were willing to offer a lot more than $17,"" Icahn told Bloomberg.",2015-12-28,66,17

3cfqrv_PEP,PEP,$PEP,"Bought 65 July 17 (10 days) OTM $98 calls for $0.25 for ~$1625 + fees.  

Current share price is around $95. Current bid/ask is around .27x.30

Earnings is on Thursday pre-market (2 days). 

Target stock price for my exit is $97-98. I would like to sell the options around $0.70-$0.80+

This is not a normal trade for me, but they have beat earnings 17 Q's in a row and have moved around 3-4%+.  

I happen to have some extra cash to bet/invest on this. #YOLO",2015-07-07,1,2
