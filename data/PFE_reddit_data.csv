1ktq10r_PFE,PFE,Let's try like this - I bought today AES and PFE,"I bought today AES + PFE + PFE options with strike price 27.5$ December 2025.   
Here is why:  
  
Tomorrow, I‚Äôm entering a position in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)‚Äîa globally recognized pharmaceutical giant with strong fundamentals and an attractive technical setup.  
  
Pfizer maintains a solid revenue base, reporting $62.46 billion in total revenue in the last fiscal year. Despite recent fluctuations, its profitability remains intact, with a gross profit of $45.15 billion. The company continues to invest in drug innovation and strategic acquisitions, ensuring long-term growth.  
  
Pfizer is a consistent dividend payer, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. Its dividend yield remains competitive, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term hold.  
  
I see strong upside potential ‚Äî both technically and fundamentally. Now is the perfect time to enter.

\+

AES has a solid business model, strong cash flow, and strategic growth in the energy sector.  
Harmonic patterns indicate an ideal buying opportunity, further confirmed by negative divergence on the RSI indicator.  
I expect not only capital appreciation but also passive income through dividends, with strong upside potential in the coming months.  
  
I see significant growth ahead‚Äînow is the perfect time to enter.

That's it guys. ",2025-05-23,12,23

1kbpebo_PFE,PFE,[DD] Could Pfizer Acquire Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)? Here‚Äôs a Deep Dive into the Possibility,"

# üß† 1. Pfizer‚Äôs Strategic Gap in Obesity Treatment

Pfizer recently **terminated development of its oral GLP-1 candidate danuglipron**, leaving a major hole in its cardiometabolic pipeline‚Äîparticularly in obesity. However, the company has repeatedly emphasized that **cardiovascular and metabolic diseases remain top strategic priorities**. CEO Albert Bourla has publicly stated that Pfizer will actively pursue external opportunities to bolster its pipeline, with obesity at the center.

According to analysts, **Pfizer has \~$10‚Äì15B in deployable M&A capital**, and with the company falling behind in the GLP-1 space, **an acquisition appears to be the most efficient solution**. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) stands out as a compelling, smaller-cap candidate to fill this void.

# üî¨ 2. Viking‚Äôs Pipeline: VK2735 and Its Commercial Appeal

Viking‚Äôs lead asset is **VK2735**, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist in both injectable and oral forms.

* **Injectable VK2735** showed **14.7% mean weight loss at 15mg** over 13 weeks in a Phase II trial‚Äî**rivaling or even exceeding** tirzepatide (Eli Lilly).
* A **Phase III trial is scheduled to begin in Q2 2025**.

The **oral formulation** also delivered promising results in a 28-day Phase I study:

* **5.3% average weight loss** at the highest dose group, with good tolerability.
* A **Phase II study started in early 2025**, with results expected later this year.

Viking also has **VK2809 for NASH**, which met its Phase IIb endpoints. However, given obesity‚Äôs much larger market size and GLP-1‚Äôs rising dominance, **VK2735 is clearly the primary attraction**.

Notably, Viking lacks in-house commercial-scale manufacturing. They‚Äôve partnered with **CordenPharma** to expand capacity, but this **dependency on CDMOs** raises concerns about Viking‚Äôs standalone commercial readiness‚Äîa risk factor for potential acquirers.

# üí¨ 3. Rumors & Analyst Sentiment

While there‚Äôs **no formal indication of deal talks**, several major investment banks (e.g., William Blair, BMO, Goldman Sachs) have listed Viking as a **likely M&A target for Pfizer**. Social media and investor forums are buzzing with speculation, especially citing Pfizer‚Äôs management statements that hint at pipeline expansion in obesity.

There are, however, **counterarguments**:

* Pfizer still holds other internal candidates (e.g., PF-07976016).
* Its prior acquisitions (e.g., Seagen) have **added substantial debt**, possibly reducing appetite for mid-stage pipeline risk.

# üßæ 4. Summary: What‚Äôs the Probability?

From a strategic and financial perspective, **Pfizer has both the motive and the means** to acquire Viking. VK2735‚Äôs strong data and GLP-1 positioning make Viking an attractive bolt-on acquisition‚Äîespecially at its current valuation.

**Challenges remain**:

* VK2735 is still in early-mid clinical stages.
* Commercial infrastructure is underdeveloped.
* Pfizer may choose to advance internal programs or wait for more de-risked assets.

üîç **My take:** I assign a **moderate (50%) probability** that Pfizer acquires Viking within the next 6‚Äì12 months.

Key variables to watch:

* Phase II oral VK2735 results (due 2025)
* Pfizer‚Äôs internal R&D progress
* Competitive dynamics in the GLP-1 space

If these stars align, Pfizer pulling the trigger on Viking would be a **strong validation of the GLP-1 trend** and a likely windfall for VKTX shareholders.",2025-04-30,1,2

1jcwj8x_PFE,PFE,Thoughts on Pfizer (PFE) as a Value Play?,"
I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on Pfizer (PFE) recently, and I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts. From my perspective, it seems like there‚Äôs a lot of upside potential with relatively low downside risk, especially given the current market conditions. I don‚Äôt believe rfk and the administration are as big of a threat or extreme as people portray them.


Dividend yield of (6%+), which is pretty appealing. But what really stands out to me is the pipeline potential. Pfizer has some promising drugs in development, alot projected to generate significant revenue late 2020s. Danuglipron data coming out in the next 2 weeks.

I know it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in short-term noise, but with good execution, I think this company could offer decent growth prospects along with the safety net of that dividend. The low downside risk, considering its defensive nature, makes it attractive in a market where volatility is a concern.

Any construtive thoughts?

I've been watching it for awhile and in the past it hasn't stayed around its current price for long,  seems like it oversold over the last couple weeks even tho it outperformed its latest quarterly results. Have i missed something? I would consider myself a novice investor at best.

This is not financial advice; all information here is for educational purposes. Please do your own due diligence. Also, if you feel the thesis outlined here is overlooking anything, please reach out. I‚Äôm delving into the financial sides of the company, and all forward-looking statements are subject to change.

**Potential Bias:**

I started the analysis while owning shares of the company. I have 5% of my portfolio invested in the company. I was hoping to find enough reasons to continue having my money in this company for the long run. Albeit, the company was outperformed by broad market indexes.

**The Good Days are over, Son!**

These few paragraphs intend to elaborate on why Pfizer (PFE) is in dire need of tectonic changes to be able to survive the upcoming tides of change. If you are not an anti-vaxxer, there is a good chance (estimate 1 in 2 people) you received Pfizer‚Äôs Covid-19 shot. Once a hailed company, it is now having problems. Big problems .

**Concern 1: Bad Management**

The company is outright having problems from top to bottom. The main focus is haphazard acquisitions. The sheer amount of money wasted on bloated acquisitions is just mind-boggling, not to mention, a simple failed acquisition. Global Blood Therapeutics comes to mind when Pfizer decided to voluntarily withdraw the product from the global market (see Table 1).

*Table 1 Pfizer‚Äôs Failed Acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics*

|Aspect|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Acquisition Cost|Pfizer paid $68.50 per share, totaling $5.4 billion.|
|Regulatory Challenges|GBT‚Äôs primary drug, Oxbryta, faced scrutiny and was later pulled from the market, raising questions about the due diligence conducted prior to acquisition¬† .|
|Market Response|Following the acquisition announcement, GBT shares initially rose, but Pfizer‚Äôs shares dipped, indicating potential investor skepticism about the acquisition‚Äôs value .|
|Notes|Please refer to [https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-voluntarily-withdraws-all-lots-sickle-cell-disease](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-voluntarily-withdraws-all-lots-sickle-cell-disease)|



Additionally, the management showed a preemptive PR shit-show as soon as they heard the word that Starboard Value is reaching out to the former C-Suite team. Specifically, I‚Äôm referring to the Fortune piece by Sonnenfeld and Tian. The text is ambiguous and full of false hope. The piece only provides the scope that supports the management and misses the whole picture. The incompleteness of the statements shines through as soon as you open up the slide deck they falsely hoped would convince the audience everything is good enough.

For instance, outright, the authors claim that the pharmaceutical sector is divided into two categories: those who embraced and frontiered the GLP1 and those who didn‚Äôt. The authors masterfully changed the x-axis in their report to show only the last year. Let‚Äôs be honest, the problems with Pfizer did not begin last year. The problem is the management and the fool‚Äôs hope that through constant acquisition a company could be maintained healthy and profitable. Even BMY surpassed PFE in performance, if you compare them from early 2021.

PFE needs to acknowledge the problem in the management and not target those who try to help.

**Concern 2: Sunset of Existing Patents**

Based on the estimated revenue share and the gradual patent expirations, one-third of PFE‚Äôs revenue might be affected. The major issue would not, however, occur until 2026 when around 15% of the current revenue might be affected. Here is another simple truth that the Fortune piece‚Äôs authors simply don‚Äôt mention. They overlook the estimated revenue shares and the years these products were introduced to the U.S. market.

*Table 2 Estimated Revenue Share from Products*

|#|Product|U.S. Patent Expiration|Estimated Revenue Share (%)|Cumulative Revenue Share (%)|Description|Year Introduced (U.S.)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Adcetris|2024|2%|2%|Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin): A monoclonal antibody used to treat certain types of lymphoma by targeting CD30.|2011|
|2|Inlyta|2025|3%|5%|Inlyta (axitinib): A kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).|2012|
|3|Xeljanz|2025|5%|10%|Xeljanz (tofacitinib): An oral medication for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.|2012|
|4|Eliquis|2026|10%|20%|Eliquis (apixaban): An anticoagulant used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation.|2012|
|5|Prevnar|2026|6%|26%|Prevnar (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine): A vaccine designed to protect against pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia.|2000|
|6|Ibrance|2027|7%|33%|Ibrance (palbociclib): A CDK4/6 inhibitor used to treat HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in combination with hormone therapy.|2015|
|7|Xtandi|2027|4%|37%|Xtandi (enzalutamide): An androgen receptor inhibitor used in the treatment of prostate cancer.|2012|
|8|Vyndaqel|2028|3%|40%|Vyndaqel (tafamidis): Used for treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a rare heart condition.|2019|

The company is now solely focused on broadening its moat instead of deepening it. LLY has been focused on GLP1 for a while, and it would take astronomical effort and investment by other competitors to reach their status.

**Concern 3: Dividends**

In the Fortune piece, the authors present PFE‚Äôs ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù dividend growth as a safeguard for the old shareholders and an incentive for new shareholders. However, for how long can the management keep up with both splurging on wrong M&As and paying a hefty share of the revenue to shareholders? If anything, as an investor, I would be second-guessing the health of the balance sheet if the company is losing momentum just to keep the dividends growing.

Even from a value perspective, the sheer amount of cash the company raked in after the Covid-19 pandemic should have moonshot organic growth and not parasitic M&As.

**Conclusion:**

These three issues are enough for me to get out of the company for the time being. I hope the management would be open to the next meeting with Starboard on Oct. 16th. This is the station where I would be getting off this bus, as the cost of going in the wrong direction is mounting up. I hope this company makes a U-turn soon.",2024-10-14,53,43

# Activist Investor Starboard Value Takes $1 Billion Stake in Pfizer

It's the classic tale of a corporate shake-up: missed targets, mounting investor frustration, and then the activists come knocking on your door. Starboard Value, helmed by the ""most feared man in corporate America"" Jeff Smith, has just taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer, seeking to revive the pharmaceutical giant's fortunes.

Pfizer's stock rose 2.12% on the news but remains down 1.83% for 2024‚Äîa stark contrast to the S&P 500's 20% climb this year.

**A Pandemic Peak and a Post-Covid Slump**  
Pfizer's pandemic glory days seem like a distant memory. During the peak, the company became a household name thanks to its record-breaking vaccine rollout. Revenues skyrocketed from $42 billion in 2020 to $100 billion in 2022. But as the world returned to normal, demand for its Covid-19 products took a nosedive.

The problem? Pfizer's other offerings couldn't pick up the slack. Even its much-hyped anti-obesity drug flopped, leaving the pharma giant without a clear path forward.

CEO Albert Bourla went on a spending spree during the pandemic‚Äînearly $70 billion in acquisitions since 2020‚Äîwhile also boosting Pfizer's R&D budget. Despite these efforts, results have been underwhelming.

Just this month, Pfizer had to pull a sickle cell drug it acquired for $5 billion. Another setback in its acquisition-heavy growth strategy.

**Reuniting with the Old Guard**  
Now, Starboard is looking to bring back some familiar faces: ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio. Both have expressed interest in returning to help steady the ship, according to reports.

Under Read's leadership from 2010 to 2018, Pfizer had a more focused approach, zeroing in on core businesses like vaccines and cancer. Starboard seems to hope that a dose of the old guard's discipline can turn things around.

Pfizer has already started reining in spending, with a $4 billion cost-cutting program announced last year. But it hasn't been enough to lift the company out of its post-pandemic slump.

Maybe Starboard's intervention, paired with a reunion of past leaders, can help Pfizer regain its lost momentum‚Äîor at least give the stock a much-needed shot in the arm.

# Google Play Must Allow Rival Android App Stores, Judge Rules

Big news in the tech world: a federal judge has ordered Google to loosen its grip on the Android app market. Starting November, the tech giant must allow rival app stores to compete more freely with Google Play‚Äîa move that could reshape how apps are distributed across Android devices.

The ruling comes after Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, scored a significant victory in its long-standing antitrust battle against Google. The judge concluded that Google abused its power by restricting developers and creating barriers for competing app stores.

Now, for the next three years, Google can't force developers to exclusively use its app store or its billing features. Rival stores will also get a shot at accessing Google's app catalog.

**Antitrust Pressure Mounts**  
The court's decision is the latest blow in Google's ongoing struggle with antitrust authorities. Just this August, the search giant lost another major case over claims that it monopolized online search and advertising markets. The pressure on Google keeps mounting, and it's not just in the U.S.‚Äîregulators worldwide are eyeing similar app store practices.

Judge James Donato, who issued the ruling, made it clear that his aim is to restore fair competition. Google will have to let developers tell customers about alternative ways to download apps, allow rival stores to have access to its platform, and ensure that app developers aren't forced to use Google's billing services.

The injunction lasts until 2027, giving competitors time to establish a meaningful presence in the Android ecosystem.

**Epic Games Is Not Done Yet**  
Epic Games, which has had mixed results in a similar lawsuit against Apple, isn‚Äôt backing down. CEO Tim Sweeney took to social media, announcing that Epic will launch its own app store on Android next year. He sees this ruling as a major opportunity for developers, carriers, and app store makers to create a more competitive Android ecosystem.

Google, for its part, is gearing up to appeal. The company insists its practices benefit users by enhancing security and consistency on Android devices. The judge allowed Google to implement ""reasonable measures"" to ensure platform security, but those measures will be under scrutiny by a committee formed by both Epic and Google.

The battle over app stores is far from over.

But one thing is certain: this ruling opens the door for a lot more competition in the Android world.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow brings the release of the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September, offering a glimpse into how small businesses are feeling about the economy. Last month, the Index dipped 2.5 points to 91.2, marking the 32nd straight month below the 50-year average of 98. Inflation was the main worry for most businesses, but with the first rate cut now in effect, it‚Äôll be interesting to see if small business sentiment changes‚Äîor if they‚Äôre still feeling the pinch from higher costs.

# Before Market Open:

* **PepsiCo**¬†($PEP) stock is coasting into its earnings report without much movement. But honestly, shareholders are unfazed‚Äîit‚Äôs all about the solid dividends and reliable earnings growth with this snack and beverage giant. PepsiCo‚Äôs strong margins and steady performance keep investors happy, and as long as the trend continues, there won‚Äôt be any complaints. Expectations are set at $2.29 EPS and $23.81 billion in revenue, so it‚Äôs more about maintaining the status quo than delivering a surprise.",2024-10-07,1,0
1fps4il_PFE,PFE,Pfizer(pfe) Undervalued ,"It‚Äôs puzzling to see Pfizer (PFE) stock currently trading so low around $28.50 when all indicators point toward much higher valuations. For a company that has generated over $100 billion in revenue during the pandemic that fueled investment like the Seagen acquisition and continues to show robust growth in its core products, the current price level seems disconnected from its true value.

Pfizer‚Äôs diverse portfolio, including blockbusters like **Eliquis**, **Prevnar**, and cancer therapies, alongside its expansion into biotech with the **Seagen acquisition**, supports a strong future. Even excluding COVID-related sales, the company‚Äôs non-pandemic drugs generate billions in steady revenue annually. With oncology advances and digital innovations accelerating productivity and growth, the stock is undervalued relative to its potential.

### 1. **Current Performance Overview**
In 2022, Pfizer generated a record $100.3 billion in revenue, driven by its COVID-19 vaccine **Comirnaty** and antiviral treatment **Paxlovid**. While the pandemic-related demand is waning, these products still contributed significant sales:  
- **Comirnaty**: $37.8 billion  
- **Paxlovid**: $18.9 billion  

However, even excluding these COVID-related products, Pfizer has a robust pipeline and portfolio that supports a strong growth outlook.

### 2. **Core Products**
Several key drugs continue to drive solid revenue:
- **Eliquis** (anticoagulant): $6.5 billion
- **Prevnar family** (vaccines): $6.3 billion
- **Ibrance** (cancer treatment): $5.1 billion
- **Vyndaqel** (for heart conditions): $2.4 billion  

Collectively, these core drugs generate about $20 billion annually, showcasing the stability in Pfizer's non-COVID business segments.

### 3. **Oncology Pipeline & Seagen Acquisition**
Pfizer's recent acquisition of Seagen strengthens its oncology portfolio, adding advanced cancer therapies and a technology platform for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). This move doubles its oncology pipeline and positions it to potentially dominate this lucrative segment. Seagen alone could add over $10 billion in revenue by 2030, as Pfizer focuses on cancer treatments for prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and other indications.

### 4. **Long-Term Growth Potential**
Pfizer is rapidly advancing in its digital transformation efforts, leveraging AI for drug discovery and operational efficiency, which could unlock an additional $750 million to $1 billion in near-term value. Coupled with innovations in oncology, vaccines, and gene therapy, Pfizer‚Äôs diversified approach to medicine ensures it will continue to grow and provide strong shareholder value.

### 5. **Justifying minimum $40 Price Target**
Using conservative estimates:
- **Non-COVID revenues** are projected to grow steadily from around $45 billion annually.
- With future oncology revenues from the Seagen acquisition and other pipeline products, Pfizer could generate over $50 billion in stable revenue post-2024.
- Assuming a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 9x on estimated future earnings of $5 per share, Pfizer stock could easily justify a $40 share price.

### Closing Remarks:
I firmly believe this is an amazing opportunity to invest in. Pfizer is well-positioned to capitalize on its current strengths, future innovations, and strong cash flow. A target price of $40 is not only realistic but conservative given its trajectory. The current market price provides an exceptional entry point, and those who recognize this will likely see significant gains as the market corrects this undervaluation.",2024-09-26,60,50

1f10rhn_PFE,PFE,Help: Were pfizer earnings low in 2023 due to the acquisition of Seagen?,"Hi

I'm trying to learn about pfizer and, i know that in 2023, there was a significant downfall in the revenue due to the drop in sales of covid products. I also know that Pfizer acquired Seagen. 

My doubt is, the acquisition of Seagen is reflected on the income statement? I don't understand at all if the reason of the 0.37 EPS (very low compared to for example 2.82 EPS in 2019, year in which the revenue was less than in 2023) is that or if the acquisition appears elsewhere in the financial statements.

If the reason for the low EPS is not the acquisition, why is EPS so low compared to previous years with less revenue?",2024-08-25,12,6

Total gain today (and likely for the week) was 704.82

Overall I‚Äôve made 7851.91 since 21 June and I thought I‚Äôd start sharing what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôs modest gain but it‚Äôs something. 

 $NVDA CC, 2 contracts, premium 2.11 a share , strike of 124 expiring 7/26. I may end up rolling this as I‚Äôm long at 118.91 and I love that low avg price. 

$GME CC, 3 contracts, premium .41 a share, strike at 29 expiring 7/26. I have an additional 24 contracts from last week expiring this week as well that I rolled for about 2k. 

$DJT CC, 1 contract, premium 1.60 a share, strike 36, expiring 7/26.

 I stupidly sold cash puts on this immediately after the assassination attempt. The fundamentals are terrible, I‚Äôm just in it for the pump and dump. Just after the assassination attempt there was a pop on the 24 hour market, another pop in premarket, and at market open. I expected the same with Biden dropping out and while there was a surge on the 24 hour market, it failed to maintain those levels premarket and at the opening bell. I‚Äôll be selling these just as soon as I can. 

$AVGO cash puts is kinda hurting me. 1 contract from last week with a strike of 158.5. I don‚Äôt think it will come back down to that level by end of week and I‚Äôve tied up 16k that I could use to just buy the stock. It has an avg price projected price in one year at 192 on Fintel, with the price at 160 right now it's basically got a bigger upside potential than $NVDA. $NVDA is sitting at 123 with a projected 1 year avg of 132. Thinking between a 5:1 or 3:2 investment ratio $AVGO to $NVDA.

Finally $PFE.  I bought 30 calls, .55 a share premium, at a strike of 31 expiring 8/30. $PFE just spent 2.54 million on lobbying (info from quiverquant.com). They have earnings coming up on 7/30 premarket and there‚Äôs been breakthrough in glp-1 medication in pill form. Covid vaccinations will be on-going revenue and they‚Äôve had positive earning several quarters in a row. My breakeven price is 31.55, so in retrospect I should have spent more money on a lower strike price, as there is significant resistance at 30. 

This is my first true options play.

The biotechnology industry has strong tailwinds set to fuel its growth with industry revenue set to grow 3.1% annually to $481.3 billion USD by 2027. Almost half of the industry revenue is generated from products to improve health and as adults over 65 spend more on healthcare. The growth in this population segment will increase the demand for biotechnology products. The emerging markets present an attractive opportunity for further market expansion as the sales in emerging markets are growing at a faster rate than in European markets due to the increasing access to healthcare and rising standard of living. The US currently accounts for 40% of industry revenue. The industry is split with 40.5% minor players and 59.5% major players. It is an increasingly consolidating industry as major players continue to acquire minor players. The Pfizer family continues to grow!  
  
**Investment Thesis** ***I*****: Strong Free Cash Flow Supports Value-Added Tuck-In Acquisition Strategy**  
  
Pfizer has a maintained strong cash flow generation and benefited from significant free cash flow growth due to the pandemic tailwinds. Pfizer‚Äôs free cash flow grew 145.3% in 2021 to $29,869 million USD. This offers Pfizer a great opportunity to continue its tuck-in acquisition strategy! Pfizer announced its deal to acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company specializing in cancer care, for $43 billion, set to be completed in late 2023 or early 2024. This acquisition enhances Pfizer‚Äôs leadership position in oncology across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology, and precision medicine with opportunities for combo therapeutic regimens. Seagen is predicted to contribute over $10 billion to 2030 in risk adjusted revenues. Over its lifetime, Pfizer has acquired 49 companies with 13 acquisitions in the past five years alone. In April, Pfizer acquired Lucira Health for $36.4 million USD (Lucira specializes in development and commercialization of infectious disease test kits) In October 2022, it acquired Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) for $5,881.63 million USD.  (GBT discovers, develops, and commercializes therapeutics for blood-based diseases). M&A offers large companies like Pfizer access to higher levels of market growth and innovation through a lower risk pathway than R&D investment. Due to its strong free cash flow, Pfizer is well positioned to deploy a tuck-in acquisition strategy, continuing to acquire minor industry players. Active acquirers outdo competitors across industries, outperforming peers‚Äô organic growth. Pfizer is ready to dig into its deep pockets!

**Broader Market ETFs**

**Last Week** ‚Äì SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.

**This Week** ‚Äì SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.

**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:

The major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:

* SPY **0.8%**
* QQQ **1.0%**
* IWM **1.5%**
* DIA **0.8%**

The 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here‚Äôs an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move. It's tight, but that's what a 16 VIX looks like vs Condors and other OTM credit spreads.

**In the News**

Covid booster shots are now a topic of conversation and Pfizer (PFE) may be available for a roll-out by the end of September with their FDA review scheduled for the 17th. Moderna (MRNA) will likely lag Pfizer and officials are recommending those that had the Moderna shots to wait for a Moderna booster. There is no timeline yet for review of a Johnson & Johnson booster. Here's how options are pricing expected moves for those three stocks out to October 1st:

As the vaccination push accelerates, vaccine stocks are getting a second-wind...or at least most are. Pfizer has struggled to match Moderna in price due to their amount of outstanding shares, lack of pipe projects, and a bit of activity on the shorting end. HOWEVER, I believe most analysts have the valuation here massively wrong due to lack of foresight in what policies and activist efforts are being pushed forward...

Call options for this thing are CHEAP. Like let me buy 100+ realistically-profitable contracts for the price of a fancy steak dinner cheap. While the technicals and white papers may not show this to be as lucrative a long-term hold in comparison to $MRNA, I believe this thing could still make millionaires out of quite a few degenerates smart enough to notice the trend from the talking-heads on social media pushing the delta-variant and subsequent stock up-ticks.

ndt9if_PFE,PFE,$PFE revisited,"This sub does not seem to have much appreciation for Pfizer. It may seem the stock is stagnant, but it has nearly doubled since 2014. It has yet to reach previous highs despite a great outlook due to the spinoff of VRTS, which got rid of a good chunk of revenue but allowed the company to focus on growth and transitioning their position in the pharmaceutical space. VRTS was all their declining drugs facing generic competition. With a 4% yield and promising room for growth, here‚Äôs why PFE is a buy and hold. 

As the pandemic rages on, the world is starting to pick favorites in the vaccine space. mRNA is coming out on top, as it should due to impressive efficacy and broad defense against variants. Pfizer uses a tiered pricing model in selling its vaccine, with first world countries paying the most and the poorest nations paying only cost, with others somewhere in the middle. Pfizer offered all nations of the world the ability to reserve shots, but the third world largely rejected it. The first world bought in big and continues to make additional purchases. Pfizer has stated this is pandemic pricing and will go up, as shown by the EU now paying more than the US for additional doses despite paying less initially. Requiring cold storage, it will likely continue to be dominant in the first world. However, multiple new formulations are being developed and Pfizer has submitted a request to approve storage of the vaccine for many weeks at a time under normal refrigerator temperatures - this will be approved. 

In America, Pfizer is the only vaccine approved for those under 18, just recently securing the 12-15 range as well. It‚Äôs playing out similarly around the world, as the FDA remains the gold standard for drug approvals. This first mover advantage will be huge as Pfizer has already stated that they believe boosters will absolutely be necessary. If you got Pfizer for your first shot, you‚Äôll be getting Pfizer boosters for ever. They are developing a great regulatory pathway to allow fast tracked approval of boosters that fight specific variants, which are easy to develop on the mRNA platform. The current vaccine is effective against all variants, however, and a first booster will likely just be another shot of the same. I believe the market continues to under appreciate the buoy to revenue boosters will provide, as it will likely be similar to a flu shot on a yearly basis. For reference, flu shots command a price of about $40 a shot but Pfizer has numerous other vaccines which are well above $100.

Pfizer has been transitioning to focusing on vaccines, and this years investments in production capacity and new technology will pay dividends. Outside of the vaccine, Pfizer has seen strong growth in core sales despite a year of lockdowns and a stoppage of elective procedures and doctors appointments that would drive growth. Additionally, major products like Prevnar saw declines due to cautionary warnings against getting the Prevnar vaccine in tandem with the COVID vax. Studies in progress will lift these as well. Excluding the COVID vaccine, revenues grew 8% operationally this quarter, and other blockbusters like Eliquis continue strong growth with patent expirations significantly far out. 

The company provides very conservative forward estimates for non COVID growth. They expect to produce up to 3 billion doses this year and have a massive pipeline with numerous highly promising candidates. 

In essence, Pfizer is a great company that has made great strides to position themselves for growth in the past few years, easily valuing the company in the mid to high 30s. Massive free cash flow from the COVID vaccine will defend the 4% yield and provide the company the opportunity to invest aggressively in their pipeline. Not only do I have shares, but I have leaps as well, as I‚Äôm quite bullish on the growth prospects. But in terms of safety of both yield and share price, I think the company presents a great opportunity for dividend investors. ABBV is a dividend love child, yet the company is wholely dependent on Humira which will face serious pressures within the next few years. I would begin rotating out of ABBV as the market will start pricing in those future pressures relatively soon.

n6d2k6_PFE,PFE,ITM leaps on $PFE,"Just bought a January 2023 $37c on Pfizer. They just announced eps of .93 and revenue of 14.5B the other day, beating expectations handily. IV is low at 30%, and they also just went ex-dividend as of today. 

The ‚Äúpatent waiver‚Äù is complete non-news. Any WTO waiver would take months of negotiations as well as unanimous consent by all parties - given Merkel‚Äôs recent comment, this is looking pretty unlikely. Regardless, vaccine availability is by and large an issue of materials sourcing and scaling manufacturing. Moderna and Pfizer say it takes them about 9 months to build a facility - they were in the process well before the vaccines were authorized for emergency use. 

Pfizer and Moderna have by far the highest quality vaccines, utilizing technology that not only does a fairly decent job of being non-specific to variants and providing antibody response orders of magnitude greater than natural infection, but also being very, very workable in terms of developing boosters.

Currently, guidelines do NOT suggest any type of mix and matching between vaccine types. Those who get a Pfizer shot first, will be told to get a second shot, and then eventually a Pfizer booster. Pfizer already is approved for those 16-18, and will be the first in the US to be approved for those 12-15 within a week or so. This first to market advantage will pay dividends as younger folks are ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù as recipients of the Pfizer branded vaccine. 

Pfizer is providing guidance of 2.5 billion - 3 billion doses in 2021. While Pfizer has stated repeatedly that it‚Äôs current $19/dose is ‚Äúpandemic pricing‚Äù and that in the future doses will be priced in line with ‚Äúother vaccines‚Äù (e.g. ~$120), we will use $19 as our guide as many of those billions of doses have already been purchased. At $19 a dose for 2.5 billion doses, that‚Äôs $50 billion in revenue. $50 billion. That‚Äôs Pfizer‚Äôs entire revenue last year. 

Pfizer‚Äôs acquisition of Wyeth set them up for great success with vaccine manufacturing, giving them the industry knowledge and experience to excel in the hard to navigate, capitally intensive space. This positioned them incredibly well for COVID, but these capital investments will be rewarded beyond the pandemic as Pfizer maintains a significant pipeline of other vaccines, as well as it‚Äôs blockbuster Prevnar 13. Prevnar sales are actually down, as there was a warning against getting both the COVID vaccine and Prevnar within a close period. 

Beyond this, Pfizer has undergone significant restructuring setting them up for growth, as well as made smart investments into rare disease and biologics. Blockbuster Eliquis somewhat recently secured patent protection up to 2026, as well. 

The market continues to under appreciate the first mover advantage and recurring sales that will result from COVID vaccines. The disease isn‚Äôt going anywhere, we will very likely need at least annual booster shots to manage variants - just like the flu. 
Pfizer is a very solid ‚Äúbig-pharma‚Äù company with really impressive management bringing a new vision to the company. With a 4% dividend yield and a forward p/e of 11, it is incredibly attractive. 

Providing $3900 of leverage with only a $450 investment, this is a bet I‚Äôm willing to make. May end up exercising this call in 2023, who knows. This is a great stock for a long term hold as well, I have been buying shares for months, but I believe this stock has been seriously suppressed this year as worries about the companys track record and pharmaceutical pricing have hampered it. It‚Äôs becoming more and more apparent that this company is a cash flow powerhouse, and will remain so for the next few years at the very least. As the market becomes more and more overbought, value like Pfizer will be sought out.",2021-05-06,2,4

I am curious why the company hasn't put its cash to use buying back shares since the price per share is extremely low right now.  Historically, doing so, will send the shares significantly higher and makes the reward far greater than the risk for buying Pfizer stock.

We filled a gap that happened back in Nov 9 last year. That often happens. Can't fight it. Now I hate that this has been going down just like everyone else.

Now volume is pretty even now and it does not seem logical that the company stock is moving down when they have the number one med out for this virus prevent. Logic would suggest other wise.

Now back to Rigel, this company has been Solid gain for me for last 2 months slow but surely.  When my friends helps me I provide 50+ pharma companies and they look at Clinical trial data to see if pre to phases are promising, next product market size, the competitors, and the management.

RIGL has multiple bangers here, Rigel Pharmaceuticals is aiming its immune thrombocytopenic purpura treatment Tavalisse (fostamatinib) at COVID-19. Rigel has initiated a Phase II study for Tavalisse that is being supported by the National Institutes of Health. The primary endpoint of this study is cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) through day 29, with multiple secondary endpoints designed to assess the early efficacy and clinically relevant endpoints of disease course as well as in vitro biological correlatives evaluating the effects of the drug on pathways involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Topline data from the study is expected in April.

Additionally, Rigel launched a Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tavalisse in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without respiratory failure that have certain high-risk prognostic factors.  moderna or Pfizer vaccine is to prevent contracting Covid, which mNRA is completely useless after having COVID-19.

If you read above statement, RIGEL is also supported by NIH (National Institutes of Health)

Recently Department of Defense funded RIGEL for clinical testing on Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK).

 **November 05, 2020**

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today further details regarding the proposed spin-off of its Upjohn Business and the subsequent combination of Mylan and the Upjohn Business to form Viatris Inc. As previously announced, Pfizer has set the close of business on November 13, 2020 as the record date for the spin-off, and the combination of Mylan and the Upjohn Business is expected to close on November 16, 2020.

No action is required by Pfizer common stockholders to receive the distributed shares of Viatris common stock. Pfizer stockholders who hold Pfizer common stock on the record date and do not sell those shares ""regular-way"" prior to the distribution date will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of Viatris common stock or their brokerage account will be credited with Viatris common stock. In addition, Pfizer stockholders will retain those shares of Pfizer common stock.

Pfizer has been advised by Nasdaq that a ‚Äúwhen-issued‚Äù market for Viatris common stock will exist beginning on November 12, 2020, the date that is the business day immediately prior to the record date for the spin-off, and continuing until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020. During this time, a Pfizer stockholder will have the option of selling the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the spin-off while retaining shares of Pfizer common stock. This option will be available under the temporary Nasdaq symbol **‚ÄúVTRSV‚Äù**.

In addition, Pfizer has been advised by the New York Stock Exchange that the following markets will exist in shares of Pfizer common stock in connection with the closing of the transaction:

* **Pfizer common stock ‚Äúregular way‚Äù market (NYSE: PFE)**: If a Pfizer stockholder sells shares of Pfizer common stock in the ‚Äúregular way‚Äù market beginning on November 12, 2020, the date that is the business day immediately prior to the record date for the spin-off, and continuing until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, that Pfizer stockholder will be selling both his or her shares of Pfizer common stock and the right (represented by a ‚Äúdue-bill‚Äù) to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the distribution. Pfizer stockholders should consult their brokers before selling their shares of Pfizer common stock in the ‚Äúregular way‚Äù market during this time period to be sure they understand the effect of the NYSE ‚Äúdue-bill‚Äù procedures. The NYSE ‚Äúdue-bill‚Äù process is not managed, operated or controlled by Pfizer, Viatris or Mylan.
* **Pfizer common stock ‚Äúex-distribution‚Äù market (NYSE: PFE WI)**: If a Pfizer stockholder sells shares of Pfizer common stock in the ‚Äúex-distribution‚Äù market, which will begin on the record date for the spin-off, November 13, 2020, and continue until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, that Pfizer stockholder will be selling only his or her shares of Pfizer stock, and will retain the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the distribution.

Trades under the symbols ""VTRSV"" and ""PFE WI"" will settle after the closing date of the combination, which is expected to occur on November 16, 2020. If the combination is not completed, all trades under these temporary symbols will be cancelled.

If the combination is completed on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, then beginning on November 17, 2020 (the first trading day after the closing), shares of Pfizer common stock will no longer trade in the ‚Äúex-distribution‚Äù market, shares of Pfizer common stock that are sold in the ‚Äúregular way‚Äù market will no longer reflect the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock and shares of Viatris common stock will no longer trade in the ‚Äúwhen-issued‚Äù market.

You are encouraged to consult with your financial advisor regarding the specific implications of trading Pfizer common stock or Viatris common stock prior to or on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020.",2020-11-05,1,5

jaxp4b_PFE,PFE,Opportunity in Pfizer (PFE) on upcoming vaccine news,"I have been studying the various vaccine candidates and their phase 3 trial timelines. I believe that the Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) partnership has the clear advantage and will likely be able to show efficacy and obtain FDA approval first among its rivals.


--

**Rationale**
In order to show efficacy, the standard is that at least 30,000 individuals must be enrolled in a phase 3 trial of a vaccine candidate. This already presents a barrier to smaller companies that cannot muster the logistics to organise and carry out such a study. It improves the advantage of larger companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Although Moderna captured early hype and headlines in the USA for promising early stage results, it will likely lag behind larger companies in crossing the finish line for Phase 3 (see google trends graphic linked below).  Pfizer has recently increased its total study to include 44,000 people, making it one of the largest phase 3 studies in the world and increasing the diversity and age range of participants.

Both Moderna and Pfizer began their phase 3 trials on 27th July. Moderna's study was limited to the USA, while Pfizer's included the USA, Brazil, Argentina and Germany. Widening the geographic scope provides more opportunity to capture diversity in the sample as well as accelerate statistical results if areas within the study have higher rates of natural COVID-19 infection. The trial is like an experiment - it requires that people in the placebo (control group) get ill at a higher naturally occurring rate than those given the vaccine. The study  therefore needs to include a lot of people so that enough have a statistical chance of naturally falling ill and showing efficacy of the vaccine.

Pfizer/BioNtech are using a protocol which consists of two shots, a first vaccination and a booster 21 days following the first injection. Moderna's is similar, but with 28 days between the first and second shot. While small, this provides a 7-14 day advantage to the Pfizer study.

Those paying attention will note that second booster shots would have started to be administered to Pfizer participants after the 16th of August, meaning that two months have now passed since the first set of volunteers were fully vaccinated under the Pfizer trial.  This should provide enough time to begin evaluating the efficacy of the trial on participants, given COVID's 15-day infection timeline.

I expect data to begin rolling in imminently showing the efficacy rate of the Pfizer vaccine trial. Moderna's will begin to come in shortly after that.  In fact, this is already what regulators in Canada and Europe are expecting. Last week PFE applied successfully in Canada to have its phase three results evaluated in real time as they start to come in.  see here: https://www.pfizer.ca/rolling-submission-for-COVID-19-vaccine-candidate

While not the front-runner in the public imagination over the summer when Moderna was grabbing headlines, Pfizer seems to be ticking up in terms of news interest. See Google Search volume for various vaccine candidates over previous 12 months: https://i.imgur.com/87sIk6H.png




**tldr:**  Pfizer to $45 and beyond on the biggest headline of the year: First vaccine candidate to pass clinical phase 3 trials and move toward emergency FDA approval.

PFE will have 30k people in 130 international sites, their dosage will be two 30 microgram injections, moderna is doing 30k, in 100 US sites (think cross section of people and age ranges will be better at more sites and internationally, so 1 point to PFE)

MRNA will do two 100 microgram injections, in their phase 1, 67% of the 100ug dose had adverse side effects and from what is published looks like only 8.3% had bad fevers with the pfe 30ug doses in phase 1....so no scientist but more than a 3x dosage probably wont go as well in a 15k people vs the pfe 30ug dosage, which seemed to have better phase 1 results, thats probably why they got a huge contract right away from the US....1 point to PFE

-The government is giving Pfizer a ""due date"" (again, NY Times): ""The contract is part of what the White House calls the Warp Speed project.""

* * *

An experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the drug giant Pfizer and the biotech firm BioNTech spurred immune responses in healthy patients, but also caused fever and other side effects, especially at higher doses.

The first clinical data on the vaccine were disclosed Wednesday in a paper released on MedRXiv, a preprint server, meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. 

The Pfizer study randomly assigned 45 patients to get one of three doses of the vaccine or placebo. Twelve receive a 10 microgram dose, 12 a 30 Œºg dose, 12 a 100 Œºg dose, and nine a placebo. The 100 Œºg dose caused fevers in half of patients; a second dose was not given at that level.

Following a second injection three weeks later of the other doses, 8.3% of the participants in the 10 Œºg group and 75% of those in the 30 Œºg group developed fevers. More than 50% of the patients who received one of those doses reported some kind of adverse event, including fever and sleep disturbances. None of these side effects was deemed serious, meaning they did not result in hospitalization or disability and were not life-threatening.

hgaron_PFE,PFE,PFE Call Options Looking Extremely Bullish in the Short Term,"Like a lot of other biotech companies, Pfizer (PFE) has been working around the clock to develop the COVID vaccine. They currently have multiple vaccine candidates undergoing clinical testing, which has been fast tracked by the FDA. This is as far as the current publicly available information goes. What I believe the public doesn‚Äôt know yet is that one of Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine candidates has been granted approval and will begin mass production in the coming weeks. Check out the link below:

https://imgur.com/gallery/1Tw5GQA

The link is a screenshot of a job posting on Indeed, which refers to PFE as a ‚Äúwell known pharmaceutical company in Kalamazoo‚Äù looking for sterile inspection specialists to ‚Äúassist with the production of the COVID vaccine‚Äù beginning in early July. As soon as news breaks that PFE is manufacturing the approved vaccine, they WILL SOAR. Investors are ready to pour money into whichever company is first to manufacture this vaccine, and it appears to me that company will be Pfizer.

TL;DR: PFE $35 8/7c

EDIT: an awesome redditor, u/utopian201 just made me aware that the recruiting company that posted the job has altered the language of the original posting to reference Pfizer by name, but has removed mention of the COVID vaccine. My personal take on this is that too much information could be inferred from their original posting; information that is not yet supposed to be publicly available. For that reason, PFE asked them to change the posting to remove references to COVID. The listed job responsibilities are still the same, and include that it is vaccine work. You can compare the screenshot of the original post that I linked with the current posting linked in the comments, and make your own determination. 

Personally, this only reaffirms to me that this is really happening; production is ramping up and they‚Äôre trying to conspicuously hire. May purchase more contracts on Monday with August and September expirations. Thanks to all for your thoughts and input!",2020-06-26,7,35

gvyy0d_PFE,PFE,Pfizer (PFE) calls are warp speed for your portfolio,"TLDR: Simple. Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. 

If you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)

Pfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. 

They are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). 

Pfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. 

While BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. 

Another reason why Pfizer? Because they are oversold following a Phase 3 drug trial fail at start of week. Irrelevant for our play.

I think we all know by now that pharma pumps hard off good data and thats what we are hoping for. Given Pfizer had a few billion in their market cap wiped off recently I am sure they will use this oppurtunity to retrace back to 38 and potentially beyond (my personal price target is 40+)

This is a set and forget play. 

June 19 have good liquidity if you are really bullish on them (risk they wont publish data before then?), July is also a good bet along with Septembers.

gvyy0d_JNJ,JNJ,Pfizer (PFE) calls are warp speed for your portfolio,"TLDR: Simple. Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. 

If you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)

Pfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. 

They are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). 

Pfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. 

While BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience.

Look at SPEX and INO and a few other company, their shares can gain over 100% on a good news and immediately drops to around previous level, if investors are buying good news, why the stock plummet right after? Any speculations who will be the next?

I own some Gilead (GILD) and Amgen (AMGN), so I am leaning toward CAT to diversify.  Since GILD is up because of the coronavirus treatment rumors, I am starting to get a bit bearish on them if they divert their R&D to that instead of their current pipeline.

From what I have been able to read, PFE is trying to slim down and focus more on new research.  CAT has kind of been just treading water lately.  But with the economy about to be turned upside down, I think they will have less competition when work starts ramping back up.

So between PFE and CAT, what does r/dividends think is the better opportunity?",2020-03-19,7,1

dy61di_PFE,PFE,Season 1: episode 1 | Undervalued stock pick $PFE (Pfizer Inc),"Hi all

I would like to share the knowledge and experience I have gained by reporting on analysis of the stocks I pick as long-term buys. These shares are **value oriented which means that the price of the share is lower that what the company could be at based on the finances of the company**. I use free cash flow metric since having profitable steady cash flow is paramount to continued growth of the company.  These valuations are calculated using the **conservative assumptions** leaning towards a grimmer outlook than what may be to hedge against the worst-case scenario. For example, in current calculations for the CPAM (capital asset pricing modeling) I am using a 9% return of the S&P500 benchmark (as opposed to 10% overall or 24% for 2019), and for a return available on a ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù investment is using a 10-year CD fixed rate of 2.5%). I will also present 2 numbers ‚Äì where 0 growth is projected in the future versus projected analysts reported growth). The former is if the company were to stop growing and its worth today versus if it was still productive and continued to grow. Clearly, the 0 growth number is the worst-case scenario so if this is close to current valuation, then there is only room to go up (for most part, excluding unforeseen situations)

Pfizer Inc (PFE)

Drugs, medications, vaccines, healthcare and medical therapy

Price as on 11/18/2019 was 37 USD/share

1. Free cash flow 11.4 B
2. Shares outstanding 5.5B
3. Cash per shares outstanding = 2.07
4. With a beta of 0.64, the risk adjusted discount rate is 6.66%
5. Using Free Cash/share: With a 0-growth scenario the stock is worth 31$ with a 5% EPS growth over the next 3-5 years and 1% growth after that ***stock is valued at 44$ (potential upside of 18%)***
6. Using earnings per share (EPS): With a 0-growth scenario the stock is worth ***40.84$ (potential upside of 10%)*** with a 5% EPS growth over the next 3-5 years and 1% growth after that, ***stock is valued at 57$ ( potential upside of 54%)***

Current P/E is 13 which supports the undervalued nature of the stock. This does not include the dividends that the stock will yield when it is held long term, current dividend yield is 3.88%.

>IN CONCLUSION: **This stock is cheap at present and will increase anywhere from 10 to 54% in long term if things keep up!**

That would mean a guaranteed 3.3% growth in that holding between now and the buyout. Is it worth selling now and reinvesting into a different holding that might yield better than 3.3%?

1ifcsb_PFE,PFE,Long term prospects for Pfizer (PFE),"Pfizer (PFE) is a major biotech company.  According to its 10k in 2012, 87% of its revenues come from biopharmaceuticals, mainly in humans.  47% of that revenue came from 10 drugs - some of which have recently lost patented exclusivity.  Lipitor in particular showed a loss of revenue of 789 million from April 2012 to March 2013.  The contract for Enbrel partnered with Amgen will soon expire as well.  Geodon I believe has lost patent exclusivity as well.  

As I perused through the 10Q, nothing looked rosy.  Sales were in decline in most of their major products due to patent expiration.  Lyrica appeared to be their shining star with over 1 billion in yearly revenue.  

While Pfizer has cut operating costs, specifically through restructuring acquisitions, notably Wyeth, revenues appear to be in decline.

There are drugs in their research pipeline seeking new indications, along with some novel compounds in late stage testing, however, I feel the days of blockbuster drugs may be near an end.  The vast majority of useful small molecules have been discovered.  New biologic medications appear to be where the industry is headed.  These, however, are expensive to produce and are usually for severe & complicated disease states.

Share buy backs and dividends have been historically the norm for this company for the past 10 years.  There doesn't appear to be any obvious conflicts of interest in management at a cursory glance.  All positives in my opinion.

I foolishly bought a few shares around 27.85 without doing my homework.  While I am up a small amount, can anyone shed some positive light on this company that I may be missing?  If not, I'm going to sell.  ",2013-07-16,1,1

I'm fine, but I'm out a really reliable car and need to get another very reliable car. This exceeds the $2,000 I had in emergency funds, so it looks like I need to get rid of some stock. I know this place is all about diversifying, but we don't need to talk about that right now. I have stock in GEO, JNJ, PFE and all three have been very good to me.
