1jurpqz_PG,PG,Procter & Gamble (PG) Dividend Increase- 2025,"***Congratulations*** to my fellow Procter & Gamble owners on your raise.

Cool 5% increase. Goes from $1.0065 per share/per quarter to $1.0568 per share/per quarter.

Currently sitting at a forward yield of 2.67%.

PG is a big position in my portfolio. It’s a buy & hold forever stock. It's the strongest CS company IMO. Everyone in the world uses products made by Procter & Gamble daily. Even in the worst of times, their products are in demand by consumers. As the market volatility impacts everyone, P&G is a safe haven. While the stock price has seen a slight decline as the market sells off, it's no where near the hurt we've been feeling with many other stocks. 

*P&G has been paying a dividend for 135 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890 and has increased its dividend for 69 consecutive years. This reinforces our commitment to return cash to shareowners, many of whom rely on the steady, reliable income earned with their investment in P&G.*

1i1yari_PG,PG,PCG - PG&E is oversold,"
PG&E got oversold(18%) in the LA fire selling frenzy despite
1) having no skin in the game in Southern California
2) ongoing massive EV adoption in NorCal 
3) having gotten approval for 5.5% rate hike in 2025
4) being in the process of deploying sensors that detect fires and shut off power. 
5) ongoing work under grounding lines. They have a better defense in any lawsuit this time around.
6) successfully legislated residential solar out of California 


Calls are super cheap on this stock with so many upsides. Downside is a massive fire in the 3rd quarter and PGE gets nailed for it, but then they can always pass on the costs to the customers. So no downsides whatsoever.
I hate this company but I am not saying no to free money.

Position: Edited out my positions as people seem more hung up on them than the DD. I keep changing my positions as the market evolves. Ty for the concern I did make money off today’s rally. 


Edit: For those offended by my playing options on Value stocks, that is kinda of my jam. When I am heavily invested in other stock and see a surefire value play why waste the opportunity for lack of money? I have benefited from this sub so took my time to post here to pay it back. That is all. That is my take on value investing. Take it or leave it.

Edit2: why is this sub anal about holding long term? You spot an unreasonable dip you make profit out of it. Everyone is here for money, everyone plays the system. If you hate pge because they lobbied to change laws in their favor, you shouldn’t be in the US stock market. Every company does it. I live in NorCal and am affected by their monopoly. When the time comes I will vote them out. I hate them with a passion and hence I have researched them thoroughly. I have no shame using that info to make money off their stock.",2025-01-15,22,110

1gqokli_PG,PG,PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

Analysts are saying that PEs will contract this year as the FED raises rates and that things like NVDA will take a big hit.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still long NVDA and my cost basis is $127 and it's still 3% of my portfolio, but I feel the share price WILL go lower and if it hits 200 to 230 or so I'll probably add some more shares.

Also, analysts are predicting things like consumer staples will fare well this year and so I thought a nice balance would be to add some PG for a little stability.

I've also got things like UNH HD SHW ODFL TMO and NEE, but feel we may correct 10 to 20% towards February or March.

rnrmcb_PG,PG,Do stocks like PG make sense in an accumulators portfolio?,"To me I think of proctor and gamble more as a way to preserve already attained wealth.  To me that would be something like $50 to $100k i didn't want to risk much of and may still be some years from retirement.

If I was within maybe 5 years I'd maybe have even less than the $100k (for example) in something like a PG just to make up for inflation.

Anyways I'm wondering if someone like myself that's in accumulation mode should even have a stock like PG with any sizeable percentage.

I mean if I have 10 to 20 years till retirement, why not something like COST instead?  Or heck even MSFT performing poorly should give a better return than Proctor and Gamble.

Even things like JNJ.  Are those better suited to preserving already attained wealth?

I realize bonds were in the past, but now they don't yield that much.

Back in John Bogles days bonds could yield up to 10% with relatively low risk.

So I guess my main question is is it better to be mostly in growth type stocks if you have a long runway and not much of a portfolio?

Does holding 5% in Proctor and Gamble (one stock for example) do anything for someone sub 6 figures portfolio?

&#x200B;

 

Embattled California power giant Pacific Gas & Electric could be a “big beneficiary” of the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by Congress on Friday, given the legislation’s focus on bolstering the nation’s power grid, according to a new report.

The bill, a pared down version of President Biden’s initial infrastructure plan, allocates roughly $25 billion to power transmission and distribution, with a focus on “building out new capacity and increasing reliability,” wrote a CreditSights team led by Andrew DeVries, co-head of U.S. investment-grade credit, in a Monday report.

“One provision we are surprised has not been discussed more is the $5 billion provision for preventing outages and enhancing the resilience of the electric grid to ‘disruptive events’ defined as an event in which operations of the electric grid are disrupted, preventively shut off, or cannot operate safely due to extreme weather, wildfire, or a natural disaster.”

Last year, the utility emerged from Chapter 11 in the unusual position of having more debt than it had before, while struggling to pay out claims to its near $13.5 billion fire victims fund. The fund was created as part of plan to exit bankruptcy.

A PG&E spokesman said the utility applauds the passage of the legislation, including its proposed appropriation of $5 billion through 2026 for extreme weather-related grid resilience improvements, in a statement to MarketWatch. The statement also pointed to the bill’s ability to “reduce customer costs for investments around undergrounding, grid hardening, microgrid implementation, fuel reduction and other critical wildfire mitigation measures.”

myv8rj_PG,PG,Procter & Gamble (PG) - a question about its future,"Hello!

I just wanted to ask this humble subreddit a question and gather your thoughts on PG - everything about this company sounds solid: from the balance sheet, cash flow, fundamentals etc.

My question is - why people would stick to those known brands, when you could for example buy soap from an unknown producer, try it, and be satisfied that you've managed to save some money? Now, hypothetically, you would have more people buying products from other sources than PG when they prefer noname products.

What PG offers that makes you think they will stick around for decades? I realize that soap, toilet paper, toothpaste etc. are essentials, but what if people will go for the cheaper options?

Mind you I like PG, I strongly consider it adding to my portfolio as I am a long-term investor, relying on dividends, dividend growth - or both. But I can't pull the trigger knowing that there's competition for the essentials and they could be left in the dust when people will try to buy the cheaper equivalents. I believe KMB, UL, CL are strong competitors? I guess this question could go to them as well.

lns27w_PG,PG,Warren Buffet's thoughts from pg 14 of 2000 shareholder letter,">What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive scale. By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters. At bottom, the “business model” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.  
>  
>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall Street ¾ a community in which quality control is not prized ¾ will sell investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.

Warren Buffet wrote this in his year 2000 shareholder letter, which I read for the first time today. It was interesting as it might be something to consider and think about as we continue to fly high. I don't profess to knowing anything about valuations, but clearly we have been doing quite well for quite some time. I, for one, am not intelligent enough to try and beat the market so I just DCA into boring ETFs and funds and am satisfied doing so, but nonetheless, these paragraphs were interesting to me as it seemed to be potentially relevant to all of the news that has been coming out lately.  


With so many new traders and so much more ease of access to the world of finance, hopefully, we see even more transparency and ease of access to information, as well. As I continue to learn and understand more I find there is an increased need for the great input and sharing of ideas that a community like this can provide.   


I am interested to know if you all think we are at risk of, yet again, replicating what Buffet spoke of in 2000.",2021-02-19,63,71

k3ptxl_PG,PG,(DD)Bullish case for PG&E,"Look guys, there is sweet tendies to be had on these meme stocks and dont think for a damn second I am not feasting on them. But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.
PG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.

1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.

2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case

3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.

4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.
Fire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.

5. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. “Hey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.” Nerds;”Hey PGE thats not generally accepted” PGE; “Exactly you retards, why would you let us do this”. They are on track to reinstate them based off of their average annual non-GAAP earnings in 2021 but you never know.

The last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.

So dont be a 🌈🐻 and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.

h8ny8s_PG,PG,PG&E: Monopolies Make You Tendies,"Okay, okay, I know what y'all are going to say. You got burned on this one before, but I think that's because y'all timed how to buy this VERY wrong.

A little background: my last picks were Activision, New Relic, and Box before earnings. All returned bigly (at least 200%+ on each one). I think PG&E is my biggest trade that will come to date, and I ask you to do a lot of research on this one before investing; there's just too much news to encapsulate it all in one DD. This is a value (Buffet) play with an autistic spin because we are fucking with calls here.

This one is a pretty simple play; the State of California will not let PG&E go bankrupt because they are a monopoly, and it's simply not that easy to get rid of a utility company that has monopolized the region. Regulators have already approved the deal ([https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/122140-pge-bankruptcy-plan-okd-by-california-regulators-now-awaiting-court-approval](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/122140-pge-bankruptcy-plan-okd-by-california-regulators-now-awaiting-court-approval)), and all that is left is for the judge to approve it as well, which is very likely for the reasons stated. Also, an important thing to note is that the judge has helped PG&E navigate bankruptcy before in 2001: [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html).

This time especially looks promising for PG&E to exit Chapter 11 because the main focus is for victims to get compensated which mostly will be in the form of stonks. If PG&E goes bankrupt, the victims really do not get left with much; thus, 88% have voted for them to exit bankruptcy. Judge Montali has said on numerous occasions that he will likely side with what the victims want, and California regulators have already approved the plan and Newsom has as well. Last time the plan was approved by regulators the stock jumped 56%, and there's currently a lot of bullish activity going on among institutional investors which you can see in dark pool volume and the new investments lead by Dan Loeb and debt financing by JP Morgan.

You should not be worried about dilution as the stock is undervalued so much that buying at current prices will still give hefty returns. I can see a rally happening anywhere from $15-21 (the broader market can have a huge effect in my opinion). Judge Montali has on his calendar that he has a PG&E hearing on Tuesday which I suspect will be decision day, and he has indicated that next week will be the week when he releases a decision. In addition, PG&E is borrowing money from the California Wildfire Relief Fund to fund their bankruptcy, and they have until June 30 deadline to exit bankruptcy to get their hands on the money they need from the state. If you want to stay extra safe, buy calls past June.",2020-06-14,188,155

gz3pwj_PG,PG,"Alright, folks, there's a possible amazing opportunity brewing up with PG&E (PCG)","PG&E is the utility company that provides electricity and gas to 2/3 of California. It has entered chapter 11 bankruptcy and its CEO left in January 2019 following the devastating California wildfires. It is set to exit bankruptcy on June 30th and its plan to do so has so far been approved unanimously by the CPUC, a judge now needs to sign off on the plan for it to go forward.

The justification to buy is simple, the company is pretty much a monopoly for an essential service  which equals a near-constant revenue, making its current price of 12-13$ a bargain.

The risk is that to exit bankruptcy is that it needs to raise a lot of money, there's an 11 billion debt refinancing deal going on and a 5.75 billion public offering, which includes 3.25 billion to common investors. This huge amount could very easily dilute shares and cause prices to drop if demand doesn't go up for the shares.

I am no expert in this and still learning a lot in terms of investing, let's discuss and try to pool our heads together and try to lose/make money together :) Now would be the time to buy depending on how we analyze the effects of the risk.",2020-06-08,8,11

(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom wants Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to make a takeover bid for bankrupt utility giant PG&E Corp.

If Berkshire is interested in buying the San Francisco-based power and natural gas company, now is the time to make an offer, Newsom said Saturday.

“We would love to see that interest materialize, and in a more proactive, public effort,” he said in an interview. “That would be encouraging to see. They are one of the few that are in a position to make a significant run at this.”",2019-10-27,210,221

PG&E Corp. PCG -25.07% stock and bond prices tumbled on Friday, as Wall Street wagered that the damage from the Kincade Wildfire will likely complicate the utility firm’s attempts to emerge from bankruptcy.

PG&E shares dropped 24%, tumbling $1.70 to $5.50 each in early New York Stock Exchange trading, after the Kincade fire spread through Sonoma County in northern California.  The company’s $3 billion bond due 2034 fell about 3.5% to 106.63 cents on the dollar and was the third most actively traded bond Friday with $130 million changing hands, according to data from MarketAxess.

The action reflects expectations that the firm may face some liability for starting the blaze, traders said—an outcome that would likely reduce any potential recoveries by investors in PG&E’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.

Officials haven’t determined the cause of the blaze, but PG&E filed a public report Thursday stating it became aware of a broken wire on one of its transmission lines in the area seven minutes before the fire began.

Among the issues at hand Friday: PG&E could be solely responsible for wildfire claims that arise before it emerges from bankruptcy, while payment for postbankruptcy claims could be shared through a statewide wildfire fund that is being set up to help shore up the finances of California utilities.

Close to 2,000 residents of the county in Northern California have been evacuated as the fire quickly grew to over 10,000 acres, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions. PG&E has been under intense pressure in the state for its role in previous fires and for a program of blackouts that aim to limit the likelihood of blazes.",2019-10-25,40,8

ag2nz5_PG,PG,"Shares for energy suppliers to PG&E are also declining, but is the risk proportional to the drop?","As a consequence of likely wildfire liability and investigation, Pacific Gas & Electric has cut its dividend to 0, their bonds were downgraded to junk status, they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, and shares have plunged. There are apparently several options for how things will proceed, depending on regulators and other factors. But whether they are converted into a public utility, bailed out by the government, issue bonds to fund liabilities, or vanish entirely, those Californians will still need electricity. Companies like Clearway Energy (CWEN) supply energy to PG&E (PCG) through long-term contracts (power purchase agreements). CWEN receives roughly 20-25% of its revenue from PCG, and its shares have fallen roughly 30% from its 52-week high, with a majority of that directly attributable to plunges following PCG news. So it seems that the market has already priced in complete failure of those contracts, but however the PCG situation shakes out, CWEN's assets will still be located in the region, ready to supply energy to the next provider. This would apply to other companies whose shares have dropped on PCG's major down days, like Atlantic Yield (AY), another yieldco with a single PCG contract. I'm probably missing some critical fact because my knowledge on the situation is very limited. Does anyone have more insight? In a worst case scenario, why couldn't these Yieldcos just renegotiate or issue fresh contracts with a new provider to replace PCG's (hypothetically) cancelled contracts?",2019-01-15,1,1

agdyyv_PG,PG,PG&E long term call options,"I'm following stock news and trying to grasp as much as I can, not doing any investing yet, so please bear with me here. 

I've seen people hoping PG&E stock would recover as it is too big of a company to be let to die. If this would be the case, having long term call options could be a very speculative, but lucrative play. But I'm wondering how would they actually play out. 

From my understanding, shares of a bankrupt company are suspended for a while - but as situation improves, would trading be resumed?

Also, if options are bought today, with 1y maturity, then trading is suspended but resumed before the maturity expires, will those options still be available, or is the bankruptcy ""cancelling"" them?

2t7sv8_XOM,XOM,Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends $MMM $XOM $PG $UGI $ARLP $GLP,"Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends

The best-known collection of stocks that keep increasing dividend payments is the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

This is where you’ll find blue chip dividend stocks like 3M $MMM), Exxon Mobil $XOM and Procter & Gamble $PG … stocks that have given investors annual dividend increases for at least 25 years in a row.

There are two other things a stock needs to be an Aristocrat… a market cap of at least $3 billion and average daily trading volume of $5 million.

Those are some serious hurdles, aren’t they?

This is why the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats get so much attention.

But what about the stocks that grow dividend payments that don’t have heavy trading volumes, and aren’t huge companies with big market caps?

Here’s where to go find them.

Here are four great places to find stocks with growing dividends, and each one of them flies under the radar compared to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 

The Dividend Champions – These are like junior versions of the Aristocrats. The Dividend Champions have raised dividends for the past 25 years, but they don’t have to be an S&P 500 stock. And there are no liquidity requirements.

The Dividend Achievers – These stocks have increased dividends for the past 10 years, and the liquidity requirements aren’t tough. Daily trading needs to be above the $500,000 mark.

The Dividend Contenders - Just like the Achievers, these stocks have raised dividends every year between 10 and 24 years. Unlike the Achievers, there are no liquidity restrictions… the stock does not need $500,000 worth of trading every day.

The Dividend Challengers - These stocks have raised their dividends between 5 and 9 years in a row.

Now that you know where to find stocks that have a history of raising their dividends every year, here’s how to get the breakthrough you need for your portfolio.

It’s all about balance. It’s a simple lineup of different kinds of dividend stocks that offset strengths and weaknesses.

The data will be entered personally by me on a daily basis at market close (unless there is a way to automate, but that's for another time).  

For tracking various GICS sectors I thought it would be easiest to enter closing prices pulled from S&P's website or closing prices of various SPDR ETF's (which should be a close approximation to the official S&P sectors).

Is there an way to find and include FY1 P/E ratios of these sectors to see if they are trading at a historical discount/premium?  I don't think you'll be able to as effectively calculate FY1 P/E on an ETF, but I'm not entirely certain.",2012-09-27,11,14

Procter & Gamble Co Lowers Q4 2012 Guidance; Comments On FY 2013 Guidance
3:52am EDT 

Procter & Gamble Co announced that for the fourth quarter of 2012, it expects organic sales growth to be in the range of 2%-3%, compared to a prior range of 4%-5%, Foreign exchange to reduce net sales by 4%, net sales to be in the range of down 2%-1% compared to a prior range of an increase of 1%-2%. Core earnings per share (EPS) are now expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, compared to a prior range of $0.79 to $0.85. All-in diluted net earnings per share, which includes a gain of $0.47 to $0.50 on the sale of the Snacks business, are expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.26 per share, compared to a prior range of $1.21 to $1.32. The revisions to the Company's fourth quarter 2012 outlook are primarily driven by slower than anticipated top-line growth from slower than expected market growth rates and market share softness in developed regions and negative impacts from foreign exchange rate changes. For fiscal 2013, it expects organic sales to increase in the range of 2%-4%, core EPS to be in-line to up mid-single digits percentage versus fiscal 2012 results. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, core EPS outlook equates to approximately mid-to-high single digit growth.",2012-06-20,16,4
