1gl448a_PLD,PLD,"Buying (right now) PLD, CCI, and O: Market Overreaction to Potential Deregulation","I’ve just taken positions in **Prologis (PLD)**, **Crown Castle (CCI)**, and **Realty Income (O)**. 

Despite concerns around potential deregulation under a future Trump presidency, I believe the market’s reaction is an overreaction. 

These companies are strategically positioned for consistent growth and income, and the risks are likely being overstated. Long-term fundamentals remain strong, making this a good opportunity.

**Crown Castle (CCI)**: A key player in telecom infrastructure, particularly 5G, with long-term leases, inflation-protected contracts, and a solid dividend yield.

**Realty Income (O)**: Known for monthly dividends, it owns a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate with long-term, stable tenants, ensuring reliable income and growth potential.

  
I know I could have simply bought \*\*XLRE\*\* or \*\*VNQ\*\* and avoided all the hassle, but as you've come to know, I like to complicate things, and the players in \*\*XLRE\*\* are very overbought in my opinion...

oziife_PLD,PLD,"Prologis $PLD - Crazy P/E, Awesome company.","With a P/E of around 65 and trading near ATH I still think this company is undervalued. I know I sound nuts but hear me out. It basically all boils down to quality industrial distribution warehouses with AAA tenants. 

I’m an industrial real estate broker and over the last 3 years I’ve seen first hand the value of quality industrial real estate values quadruple in many markets. Sometimes even more. And there is no other institutional landlord and developer that builds higher quality facilities than Prologis. They’re on the cutting edge on what otherwise is a simple concept: build really big and tall rectangular buildings with lots of shipping doors and have them occupied by quality tenants. In every market I work Prologis consistently has the best buildings and they always seem to have something under construction. 

Industrial real estate, especially warehouses and DC’s is in epic demand and I can’t see that changing anytime soon. I’ve moved all my REIT holdings from other asset classes like office and retail all into industrial REITs and Prologis is still my #1 pick long term. If this trend continues I can see them trading at double what they are at now within 18 months. I’ll gladly buy the dips along the way.",2021-08-06,3,6

j5q04d_PLD,PLD,Prologis Inc DD: The next big earnings jump,"So there's no need to really explain that Amazon is a big boi and that while you can still trade it for money, if you want astronomical gains on amazon in under a month you're out of luck since everyone has already played that fiddle to death.

And of course every idiot and their mother has pumped the amazon copy cats. No need to go over those, they've already meme'd out as much as possible. Most of these places have worst margins than amazon without the attached data and cloud components to subside the remainder of their operations. Sure they're decent companies doing insane amounts of business but I don't expect to see Wayfair go up another 15-30% anytime soon.

So how do we squeeze the remaining juice out of this E-Commerce trend? After all while alot of these companies have reached their peak evaluations, the market they've created hasn't and ecommerce will likely continue to grow for the rest of our lives.

Well let me introduce you to my little friend: Prologis

Amazon and all of these other companies need warehouse space bigly and Prologis has taken advantage of this the best they can. They've recently raised their warehouse rents on papa bezos by [over 20%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-warehouses/behind-those-amazon-prime-boxes-a-bull-market-in-warehouses-idUSKCN0Z92AK) while still growing their business. 

That same article I mentioned argues that this trend will continue due to a pretty interesting catalyst:

> Some fund managers expect the rally to continue, in part because of a technical change by S&P that will recognize real estate as its own sector, rather than a part of financials. That will require active U.S. equity fund managers - who have traditionally been underweight real estate - to buy more than $100 billion in real estate shares to reach a market neutral position, according to J.P. Morgan.  
>  
>“You’re going to see more adoption of REITs overall, especially on the part of managers who haven’t held the sector before, and they’re going to gravitate to what they know,” said Mike Underhill, portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments.  
>  
>Underhill estimates Prologis will be among the companies that see the largest inflows as a result of the change because of its connection to the more-familiar consumer discretionary sector.

So asides from the rent thing what does this have to do with earnings? Not as much. But keep in mind their next earnings report is October 20th. Not only will they report a blow out earnings as a result of a massive increase in their margins but they've also been preparing for it with a massive acquisition that happened last august of DCT, the fruits of which should just [start to ripen](https://www.prologis.com/logistics-industry-news/press-releases/prologis-completes-85-billion-acquisition-dct-industrial):

&#x200B;

>SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today announced it has completed its all-stock acquisition of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (NYSE: DCT) for $8.5 billion, including the assumption of debt.  
>  
>In connection with the transaction, each share of DCT common stock was converted into 1.02 shares of Prologis common stock.  
>  
>The DCT portfolio is highly complementary to Prologis' existing portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. The DCT portfolio includes the following:  
>  
>71 million square foot owned and managed operating portfolio  
>  
>7.5 million square feet of development, redevelopment and value-added projects  
>  
>305 acres of land in pre-development with an estimated build-out potential of over 4.5 million square feet and 131 acres of land under contract, or option, with a build-out potential of over 1.6 million square feet

So tldr:  They are gonna benefit massively from the ecommerce boom and have some big catalysts coming up. They are gonna go up pretty nicely so get in on it now while it lasts!

6ntrt8_PLD,PLD,"Bank Earnings Tomorrow Morning (BAC, GS, PGR, AMTD, PLD, CMA)","Plenty of banks are reporting earnings tomorrow.

We know JPM and Citigroup already beat on their earnings, although it did not result in significant gains in the share prices.

We know they said that trading profits are down, which may be bad for GS.

Short interest on XLF has been rising as of late.

All the same I think we will see all these banks beat earnings and it will push XLF above the 25 resistance.

I am playing this just by buying some OTM weeklies on XLF and KBE. I also am holding my Sept XLF calls that I've had for a while. Low probability of win, low capital risk, and big capital reward.
