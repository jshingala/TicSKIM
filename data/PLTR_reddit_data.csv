1kez2cr_PLTR,PLTR,PLTR: The Most Overvalued Stock in History,"While everyone‚Äôs focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir.

Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stock‚Äôs valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals.

Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately):

![img](s3lyvzswauye1)

**Nvidia**

Nvidia‚Äôs valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher.

**Tesla**

Tesla‚Äôs 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesn‚Äôt have anywhere close to that growth coming.

**Cisco**

Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline.

**Zoom**

The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while we‚Äôre at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop.

Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we‚Äôve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia‚Äôs peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.

**Conspiracies**

Palantir‚Äôs surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I‚Äôm 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.

Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn‚Äôt stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.

tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it‚Äôs the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share.",2025-05-05,262,93

Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

Palantir (PLTR) recently showed strong buying momentum ‚Äî lots of fresh upside bets around the $105‚Äì110 range.

However, **last week a lot of downside protection expired**.  
This leaves PLTR more exposed if new downside bets show up.

**Key tip:**  
Always check if new downside pressure is growing faster than upside momentum before making any move.

* If downside pressure rises = caution.
* If upside pressure holds = rally can continue.

1k5bvyk_PLTR,PLTR,Help with PLTR covered call strategy,"I‚Äôve been rolling covered calls on PLTR since mid December. I have $200 shares at a cost basis of $23, so significant gain.

I, however, sold a 2x covered calls when the market crash a couple weeks ago for a $55 strike, expiring May 23rd.

My MO would be to let theta decay it down, wait for the next down trend, and re-roll to a high strike at 45-60 day expiration to start the process again.

I‚Äôve tried to read different strategies but am struggling a bit to verify potential risk. I‚Äôm wondering if this strategy makes sense?

1) sell the 200 shares while they are high at $90-95
2) sell 2x puts at a lower strike (60-70?) for an earlier expiration assuming I think the stock will drop to that point, obligating me to buy 200 shares at a lower price while keeping the gains of that spread
3) either re roll the $55c 5/23 or let it hit ITM and take the spread as the loss.

1jdayon_PLTR,PLTR,Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Analysis,"Disclaimer: Please note that I am not a financial adviser, and the views expressed here are solely my own. Do not rely on my analysis for investment decisions; always make your own judgment. I am not responsible for any gains or losses you may incur. However, if you'd like to share your thoughts on my analysis, feel free to do so in the comments.

Understanding:

Palantir's platform specializes in processing large volumes of both quantitative and qualitative data, transforming it into easily digestible visualizations (such as charts and illustrative methods). This enables users to extract actionable insights from complex datasets, helping them make informed decisions. Palantir‚Äôs software is versatile, capable of handling a wide range of data types and enabling deeper analysis compared to many competitors.



Strengths:

\- Advanced Data Processing: Palantir excels at analyzing diverse data inputs (both structured and unstructured) in a way that provides deeper insights than many competitors, effectively handling complex datasets.

\- Highly Customizable: The platform is flexible, offering tailored solutions for both government and commercial clients, catering to specific needs and demands.

\- Strong Government Relationships & Proven Track Record: Palantir has built long-term, trusted relationships with government agencies, thanks to its proven success in handling sensitive, high-stakes projects. This track record reinforces its reputation for reliability, security, and effectiveness, providing Palantir a competitive edge in securing new government contracts. Additionally, its stellar performance enhances its ability to secure new commercial contracts, further strengthening its portfolio.

\- Seamless Integration: Palantir's platform integrates easily with existing systems, facilitating adoption without requiring significant changes to client infrastructures.

\- Long-Term Contracts: Many of Palantir's contracts are long-term, ensuring steady revenue streams while allowing for client diversification.

\- Potential Interest Rate Cuts: If interest rates fall, companies may have more funds available for internal upgrades, which could boost demand for Palantir‚Äôs services.



Weaknesses:

\- Niche Use Case: Palantir‚Äôs offerings are highly specialized, meaning only organizations requiring sophisticated data analytics will find value in its services. Simpler needs can often be met by cheaper, less complex solutions.

\- Dependence on Government Contracts & Government Spending Cuts: Palantir relies heavily on government contracts, which provide consistent revenue. However, this dependence makes the company vulnerable to potential reductions in defense spending or budget cuts. Any decrease in government spending could negatively impact Palantir‚Äôs revenue growth and overall financial performance.

\- R&D Spending: Palantir invests heavily in R&D, and while the risk is relatively low due to the strong foundation of its current platforms, failure to produce significant innovations could impact the company‚Äôs future prospects.

\- Impact of Government Spending Cuts and Slower Growth on Palantir‚Äôs Future Performance: Reductions in defense spending, potentially driven by political shifts such as decreased U.S. global military involvement under a new administration, could reduce the need for Palantir's services. This may slow the company‚Äôs revenue growth and negatively impact its bottom line. While Palantir has experienced rapid growth in recent years, concerns about these spending cuts may lead to slower growth in the near future, potentially resulting in negative net income growth for a year or two before returning to a more modest pace. This anticipated slowdown could also cause stock price volatility, as investors may shift their focus to other stocks offering more immediate, high-growth potential.

  
Summary:

Although Palantir remains a solid company, the factors mentioned above may negatively impact its bottom line over the next few years, potentially affecting its stock price. Based on technical analysis, I‚Äôve identified four key levels of support and resistance: 75, 80, 90, and 100. Currently, the price is around $86. Considering the macro headwinds and the possibility of slower profit growth in the near future, I‚Äôm opting for a more conservative approach to this trade and aiming to take profit at the $90 mark. While there is a scenario where Palantir could rise back up to $100, based on my belief that other investors may share a similar cautious sentiment and my outlook for the company, I prefer to adopt a more prudent strategy.

PLTR rallied close to a Fibonacci return of 0.5(94.34$) due to macroeconomic selling pressure, such as major shareholder selling, under RSI overbought and technical analysis. However, it failed to fill in the MACD gap and RSI has yet to enter the oversold section indicators suggest a downward trend, but the price seems to have risen and is judged to be a downward divergence, and the adjustment seems to be a little bit more. The target price is around $95.2$ What do you think?

It's hard to think the fundamentals have been damaged, and the four-hour candle shows no signs of slowing down as the MACD gap narrows yet

Based on the hour candle data, I think the adjustment is almost complete. Although I think the current location still has adjustments or fluctuations, I think it's a place to consider new entry or additional purchases

3. Because CEO is gonna sell regardless. 
4. Because ppl wanna liquidte and get in on SMCI action. 
5. Because, fuck your calls.

üîéStrategy Components:
1. **Long Position:**
   - ‚ûïBuy a LEAP deep ITM call option (minimize theta decay)
   - E.g: Purchase a PLTR Jul18 $90 Call for $4,000 with a theta of -$5.

2. **Short Position:**
   - ‚ûñSell weekly OTM call options against the long LEAP call to collect premium income.
   - E.g: Sell a PLTR Feb21 $130 Call for a premium of $140 with a theta of $18.

üî¨Example Trade:
* Buy PLTR Jul18 $90 Call for $4,000 (theta = -$5).
* Sell PLTR Feb21 $130 Call for $140 premium (theta = $18).

üóùÔ∏èOutcome Scenarios:
1. **PLTR Closes < Short Call Strike Price:**  
   - I retain the premium collected from the short call.  
2. **PLTR Closes > Short Call Strike Price:**

1ikmpma_TSLA,TSLA,Are Morningstar's Fair Value Estimates Consistent? My Experience with PLTR and TSLA,"I've been a Morningstar subscriber for the past 5 years, and while some of their advice and analysis has been helpful, certain recommendations leave me puzzled. Let me share an example:

As a novice investor, I bought Palantir (PLTR) during its initial public offering and made a profit. After each earnings report, Morningstar kept increasing the company's fair value estimate up to $32. Then suddenly, the value dropped to $7-8. This coincided with a change in analyst coverage, and they initiated new coverage with a fair value around $9. 

Now that the stock has skyrocketed due to market enthusiasm, I checked their analysis again. I notice they've changed analysts once more, and the fair value has been dramatically revised to $90. I find this difficult to comprehend. While I highly respect Morningstar, I struggle to understand how they can justify such a valuation.

A similar situation occurred with Tesla. Morningstar advised avoiding Tesla in 2019-2020, but now they've set its fair value at $250. These dramatic shifts in valuation estimates make me question their consistency.",2025-02-08,24,36

1ih6aa7_PLTR,PLTR,I hold both $PLTR Palantir and $BB Blackberry. Why I'm confident Blackberry will be the next Palantir,"Ah yes, I'll say it first, ""oh look, another BlackBerry thread, these always come up once every year and nothing ever happens"" or ""been holding BBags since $15"". Well, I've been holding onto my BBags for 4 years (just as I have with Palantir) - you can check my posting history for receipts - and I'm holding for glory.

Back to the comparison. Once upon a time, Palantir was building an operating system called Foundry that Wallstreet and paperhands collectively decided could be a worthless pipedream and dropped it back to and below it's original DPO price to $6 and change.

Fast forward to today and the stock is $100 and you have Dr. Alex Karp saying this:

***‚ÄúFor the first time people want to partner with us, it used to be partnership meetings where it was a complete waste of time and BS just so they can say they met with us like high school dating for nerds‚Ä¶now, I have real partnership discussions because a lot of these people in verticals have to deliver and are under a lot of pressure and know how good our products are‚Äù. - Alex Karp***

\----------------

Now lets compare this to BlackBerry with a short little history lesson. Okay, a super short  history lesson. Forget their phones ever existed - they acquired a company called QNX in 2010 and have since been the de facto **OPERATING SYSTEM** for most cars not named Tesla and are in 24/25 EV's that are becoming increasingly complex and data driven (they also have a significant presence in the growing medical devices field and soon to be robotics field as well, which are gravy on top of the cherry).

Palantir was head banging away 20+ years to get their operating system to be future proof (okay, admittedly I don't know if it actually took them 20 years to develop Foundry, but lets go with that) and similarly, BlackBerry has been doing the same with QNX.

Now lets read a couple quotes from the BlackBerry team about QNX.

Quote #1:  
***The moat -- the competitive moat around this QNX business continues to remain very deep.***

***And to John's point, if anything, we're in a fairly strong position here that OEMs are coming to us and asking us to do more. - Tim Foote, Chief Financial Officer***

Quote #2:  
***Customers are now coming to QNX for its proven safety and security credentials, which are essential in today's market. - John Chen, Former CEO***

\-----------------

Okay, now it's time for you to do some brain work and think this thought through carefully. Do you think an operating system that makes your car and whatever future car(s) you're going to buy (unless you buy a Tesla) functional and is critical for safety, is worth only 3.71 billion dollars?

What if I told you that this operating system could also be the foundation for medical devices that'll keep you alive after your 10th trip to Vegas or Thailand? Or what if I told you that it could be integral to making sure that your robot housemaid isn't stealing your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend?

The TLDR of all of this is:

Would you rather buy a McD's burger for $4 or a single share of an operating system that hasn't yet been discovered as the most secure operating system for cars and in the future, robotics and medical devices?

\------------------

My total dollar amounts invested (attached a screenshot for proof):

Account #1 - $173,644.56 CAD (currently worth $114,615.60 CAD)

* End of wars: I know, this is as unconventional opinion as me buying PLTR puts. But the whole ideology of new guv is reciprocal _""scratch my back""_, as opposed to Biden's _""give us the oil or else..""_. I see tightening fiscal spending, DOGE which includes defense, to some extent.
* Valuations: this one is easy to see. Take PE, PS whatever metric. It's overvalued AF!! I doubt, if PLTR engineers are necessarily smarter than any Mag-7 tech guys. I'd bet the opposite rather. I've seen their products, trust me üòâ, I know. The whole sales pitch is based on cronyism, arm-twisting, because those ""POCs"" (proof of concept testing of their software) is as corrupt as Pfizer's new drugs.

Technical/ options data facts:

* Ridiculous run up in price - it is THE BEST preforming stock of 2024, and after a tiny dip, has sprung back to life. To me, this is plain euphoria.
* Besides, it's a high beta stock. It's a good hedge against any softness in broad markets, which too are getting frothy. I see this PUT as a hedge against my tiny profits on index ETFs.
* Ridiculous premiums. Implied volatility at 70-80%. This means even for a good 5% move in stock price, OTM options would barely move 10%. This is great news for sellers, but also for buyers, because the premium value is farely stagnant and ""safe"". I know, it won't stay like this forever but then it's volatile *for a reason* (i.e. earnings). 
* Based on previous guidance, the '24 earnings are not going to be as stellar as people expect. On that note, even if the earnings are good, as happened often to NVDA, market isn't ever satisfied. NVDA crashed even after 100% revenue growth! Same could happen to this one too. Of course, this is pure speculation, but hey, did you read the title of this post? üòâ",2025-01-24,0,26

1hwed3s_PLTR,PLTR,$PLTR BLOODBATHü©∏ü©∏,"Looking at Palantir ($PLTR), I think we‚Äôre about to see a pullback. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Seller Pressure: There‚Äôs a noticeable seller pressure building up. On the daily chart, we can see a consistent uptick in volume, which indicates that there‚Äôs more selling activity than buying. This is often a sign that a stock is losing steam and may be ready for a correction.

2. Valuation Concerns: Palantir has been extremely extended, especially considering its current valuation. While the company has impressive technology, the market is pricing it at a level that might not be sustainable in the long term. The stock has run up significantly, and there‚Äôs a chance that it‚Äôs starting to reach a point where investors may start taking profits.

3. Technical Indicators: The volume uptick combined with the valuation concerns points to the potential for a significant pullback. With the stock so extended, it seems ripe for a correction or even a more significant selloff, especially if the broader market starts to show signs of weakness.

1hll8a3_PLTR,PLTR,"PLTR Call Option @ $32, Exercise or Sell","Hello, I have a PLTR call option (1 contract) that I bought for $6/share ($600 total) with a strike price at $32, expiring June 20, 2025. I'm up +741.78% and the current total value of the option is $5,055. While I would love to hold on longer, many of us PLTR shareholders are afraid of a major pullback on the share price. I'm thinking of exercising, as opposed to selling, but I'm not sure.

I'm very long Palantir and would love to accumulate as many shares as possible. However, this call option is in my taxable, so if I sold and tried to buy shares, I'd have to set aside money for taxes, AND I wouldn't be able to get 100 shares at $32. This option is also not a leap, so I'm looking at a fat 30% tax.

Current share price is $80.69

I did some math and it looks like if I exercise, I'll pay $38/share for 100 shares, so a total of $3800, and receive a value of 100 shares x $80.69 = $8,069. This is a net unrealized gain of $4,269 (212%% gains).

Alternatively, if I sell the call, I will make a realized gain of $4,454 taxed at 30%, plus the original $600 untaxed. I will pay $1,336.20 in taxes (which is like a 26.43% drawdown from the total value). After taxes, I will keep the remaining $3717.80. If I use this money to buy PLTR shares at the current price, I will be able to buy 46.07 shares at $80.69/share, all from my original investment of $600... not bad (619% gains). If I bring in an additional $3,200 to match the total investment of the exercise strategy, I will be able to purchase an additional 39.65 shares at $80.69/share. This brings my total shares to 46.07 + 39.65 = 85.72 shares, with me paying $44.33 per share. All for the same amount of total investment: $3,800. I'll pay $44.33/share for 85.72 shares, so a total of $3800, and receive a value of 85.72 shares x $80.69 = $6,916.74. This is a net unrealized gain of $3,116.74 (182% gains).

By selling, and then buying, I'd basically be missing out on $1,152.26 of unrealized gains compared to exercising, equaling 14 shares being left on the table.

My assumption is this: Since I'm long, exercising would be the better choice assuming I have the $3200 to buy 100 shares at $32/share. However, if $3200 is too much for me to come up with, then selling would be the better option, and I wouldn't even bother with the extra $3200, and just convert the remaining $3717.80 into 46.07 shares.

If I have cash, exercise. If I don't, sell then buy.

Is this correct?",2024-12-24,77,90

1hfsy3h_PLTR,PLTR,My SRFM and PLTR conspiracy and how it could make you rich,"Palantir‚Äôs investment in Surf Air Mobility (SRFM) isn‚Äôt just an equity play‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic partnership with exponential implications for Palantir‚Äôs bottom line. By owning \~27.6% of Surf Air, Palantir has tied its growth to Surf Air‚Äôs success, creating a unique feedback loop where Surf Air‚Äôs revenue and stock performance directly impact Palantir‚Äôs market cap. Let‚Äôs break this down with a real-world example of how even a single private jet flight could have a massive effect on Palantir.

# 1. Palantir‚Äôs Stake in Surf Air

Palantir owns 4,582,018 shares (\~27.6%) of Surf Air. This means:

* A $1 increase in Surf Air‚Äôs stock price adds $4.58M to Palantir‚Äôs holdings.
* With Palantir‚Äôs P/E ratio of \~362, that $4.58M could boost Palantir‚Äôs market cap by \~$1.65B.
* Conversely, a $1 drop in Surf Air‚Äôs stock price could wipe out $1.65B from Palantir‚Äôs market cap.

# 2. The Private Jet Example: A Single $100,000 Flight

Here‚Äôs how one $100,000 private jet flight could ripple through Surf Air and Palantir‚Äôs valuations:

* Profit Impact for Surf Air: At 50% profit margins, Surf Air earns $50,000 in net profit from the flight.
* Stock Price Impact for Surf Air: With 15.51M shares outstanding and an assumed P/E ratio of 20, this $50,000 profit increases Surf Air‚Äôs Earnings Per Share (EPS) by $0.00322. This raises Surf Air‚Äôs stock price by: 0.00322√ó20=0.0644‚Äâ($0.0644¬†per¬†share¬†increase¬†for¬†Surf¬†Air)0.00322 \\times 20 = 0.0644 \\, (\\text{\\$0.0644 per share increase for Surf Air})0.00322√ó20=0.0644($0.0644¬†per¬†share¬†increase¬†for¬†Surf¬†Air)
* Impact on Palantir‚Äôs Holdings: Palantir owns 4.58M shares of Surf Air, so the $0.0644 per share increase adds: 4,582,018√ó0.0644=294,833‚Äâ($294,833¬†increase¬†in¬†holdings¬†value¬†for¬†Palantir)4,582,018 \\times 0.0644 = 294,833 \\, (\\text{\\$294,833 increase in holdings value for Palantir})4,582,018√ó0.0644=294,833($294,833¬†increase¬†in¬†holdings¬†value¬†for¬†Palantir)
* Exponential Impact on Palantir‚Äôs Market Cap: With a P/E ratio of 362, this $294,833 increase in earnings is valued by the market at: 294,833√ó362=106,746,386‚Äâ($106.7M¬†increase¬†in¬†Palantir‚Äôs¬†market¬†cap)294,833 \\times 362 = 106,746,386 \\, (\\text{\\$106.7M increase in Palantir‚Äôs market cap})294,833√ó362=106,746,386($106.7M¬†increase¬†in¬†Palantir‚Äôs¬†market¬†cap)

Summary: A single $100,000 flight with 50% profit margins could add $106.7M to Palantir‚Äôs market cap.

# 3. The Bigger Picture: Scaling Up

Now imagine scaling this:

* If 10 flights are booked at $100,000 each, Surf Air generates $1M in revenue and $500,000 in profit (at 50% margins). The impact on Palantir‚Äôs market cap? \~$1.07B.
* This shows how even modest growth in Surf Air‚Äôs operations can have outsized impacts on Palantir‚Äôs valuation.

# 4. Recent Dilution Reductions: Protecting the Upside

Surf Air recently announced a 90% reduction in potential equity dilution, cutting its share subscription facility from 40M shares to just 4.4M shares (worth \~$15M at current prices). This move aligns with its plan to fund growth through a $50M term loan rather than issuing more shares.

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting:

* The remaining 4.4M shares is suspiciously close to the 4.58M shares owned by Palantir, suggesting this move could be influenced by Palantir‚Äôs interests.
* By limiting dilution, Surf Air ensures that future growth or profitability directly benefits existing shareholders‚Äîmost notably, Palantir. This creates a setup where revenue and stock price growth are amplified.

# 5. The Stakes: Why Losses Matter Too

This relationship works both ways. Palantir‚Äôs exposure to Surf Air creates risks:

* A $1 drop in Surf Air‚Äôs stock price wipes $4.58M from Palantir‚Äôs holdings, reducing its earnings by the same amount.
* At a P/E of 362, this could shrink Palantir‚Äôs market cap by \~$1.65B.

Palantir is highly incentivized to ensure Surf Air‚Äôs success, as any losses directly affect its financials and market cap.

# 6. Why This is Unique

For most companies, revenue is tied to product consumption. But Palantir‚Äôs ownership in Surf Air creates a unique synergy where every dollar of revenue or stock price movement at Surf Air directly benefits Palantir.

This partnership represents one of the most efficient feedback loops imaginable:

* Every $1 increase in Surf Air‚Äôs stock price could add \~$1.65B to Palantir‚Äôs market cap.

Even small investments, like a single $100,000 flight, can cascade into massive valuation boosts for Palantir.

# Scaling This Up: Why Thiel or Karp Could (and Should) Fly Surf Air

Now, imagine **Peter Thiel** or **Alex Karp** (or their billionaire friends) booking private jet flights. For someone in their circles, $100,000 is a negligible cost for a luxury service. But because of Palantir‚Äôs ownership stake in Surf Air, this expense becomes an indirect way to boost Palantir‚Äôs market cap.  


# TL;DR

* A single $100,000 private jet flight with Surf Air could add $106.7M to Palantir‚Äôs market cap.
* Recent dilution reductions by Surf Air ensure future growth isn‚Äôt diluted, aligning their strategy with Palantir‚Äôs interests.
* By owning 27.6% of Surf Air, Palantir has created a strategic amplifier for its market value, where Surf Air‚Äôs success translates directly into exponential growth for Palantir.

With Surf Air planning to exceed $100M in revenue and achieve profitability by 2025, the stage is set for Palantir to benefit exponentially from their partnership.",2024-12-16,39,27

They do however have significant debt issues  and the stock price has dropped almost 50% in the last year. That being said there has been a change in momentum as we see it rising 140% in the last 3 months since Palantir bought more shares in October.

[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.



**2. Revenue Growth Isn‚Äôt Scaling as Expected**  
While Palantir‚Äôs revenue growth has been solid, it‚Äôs showing signs of deceleration:

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn‚Äôt justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir‚Äôs AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It‚Äôs easy to talk AI; it‚Äôs harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir‚Äôs dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels.

1gtg4sz_PLTR,PLTR,PLTR Leaps - opinions on delta? ,"I am bullish on PLTR long term as I believe their technology will be one of the key enabling data platforms for AI workloads.

I am looking to put about $30K-50K into PLTR leaps. Looking at either Oct25 or Jan26 call options at various strike prices, from $45-65. Three questions:

1. Do people prefer to pay higher premium for deeper ITM calls, with a higher delta? 
2. Do you have rules of thumb for delta for leaps (assuming 11 months and 14 months to expiration)? I am thinking .70-.85 is a good target, but OptionStrat often recommends much deeper ITM (e.g. .95 delta) for leaps.
3. Would you spread out across different SPs? For instance, rather than buy 10 at a $45 SP for Oct, which currently costs $27,800 is it preferable to buy 4 contracts at $45, 3 at $50 and 3 at $55?

1elkytx_PLTR,PLTR,PLTR: WTF DO THEY DO?,"If you are bullish on AI, then you have to be bullish on PLTR. Here's a summary of what Palantir ACTUALLY does. I wrote a longer article but I feel like most people on here don't have the attention span for anything but bullets. \*PLTR IS MY BIGGEST POSITION AND I'LL BE BUYING ON ANY DIPS BELOW $25\*

* Palantir leverages AI to process and analyze vast amounts of data within a company, process, or organization and then helps identify complex patterns and derive actionable insights.
* If a company‚Äôs in-house data solution is data-Frankenstein, then Palantir is a data-Zeus, the god of all data solutions.
* **Foundry**
   * Think of Foundry as a super smart filing system that stores all sorts of information from different places. This tool can pull together bits of data from various sources, like spreadsheets, emails, and databases, so that everything is in one place. Then, it will use a really smart and well-trained robot to help your company make important observations and decisions based on the data.
   * Puts data together: Foundry can take all sorts of information from different places and put it together so it‚Äôs easier to see everything at once.
   * Keeps data safe: It makes sure that the data is secure and handled properly, following rules about privacy and safety.
   * Helps make decisions: It uses AI to help people at a company make decisions by showing them patterns or trends in data that might not be obvious.
   * Lets people work together: Foundry helps teams within a company work better together by sharing their findings and plans based on the data.
   * Custom tools: Companies can create their own tools (code, low-code, and no-code tools) with Foundry to address specific needs they have, making their work easier and more efficient.
   * Foundry uses AI to automatically combine data from different sources ‚Äì this helps avoid the need for a lot of manual work to clean up and organize the data.
   * Foundry makes it easy for you to use AI to make predictions or find patterns in data.
   * AI in Foundry helps analyze words in documents or online posts to gather important information or see how people feel about something.
   * AI helps create charts or point out important bits of data quickly, making it easier for people to understand what the data means.
   * Foundry‚Äôs AI can help businesses plan better or test out ideas by simulating different scenarios. This is like trying out strategies in a computer game to see what might work best in real life.
   * Foundry‚Äôs AI also helps keep the data secure by looking out for any unusual activity that might suggest a security problem.
   * Ontology is a cataloging system for data ‚Äì it organizes data into specific categories and relationships.
   * Just like a well-organized library allows you to navigate through shelves of books effortlessly, a well-structured ontology allows computers to navigate through large datasets.
   * What type of company should use Foundry? Any company that manages large volumes of data.
   * Stellantis, Airbus, PGE&E, Tyson, Cleveland Clinic, British Petroleum, Exxon Mobil, and even Ferrari‚Äôs F-1 racing team have all partnered with Palantir Foundry.
* **Gotham**
   * Gotham‚Äôs main clients are military, defense, intelligence, counterterrorism, and law enforcement agencies.
   * Gotham enhances military operations with an AI-powered kill chain that helps soldiers quickly identify and manage targets.
   * Gotham can control sensors like drones and satellites either automatically with AI or manually with human input.
   * Gotham transforms any location into a command center with mixed reality, allowing operators and commanders to work together virtually.
* **Apollo**
   * Put simply, Apollo helps a company manage, deploy, and scale Palantir software within their organization.
   * Continuous software deployment is a lot more complex than it may seem.
   * If SaaS was the hero to software deployment issues in the 2010‚Äôs, then Apollo is software deployment‚Äôs modern-say savior. This was all a long-winded way to say that Apollo helps companies easily manage continuous software deployment and integration so that they can focus their attention back to innovation and away from meaningless deployment and update issues.
* **AIP**
   * AIP is a no-code environment for creating, testing, and deploying AI functions using LLMs. You can build, test, and deploy features using a simple interface without needing to write complex code.
   * AIP is absolutely game-changing for enterprises hoping to leverage AI into their operations. I think that within the next 3-5 years, most large enterprises will be using AIP someway somehow within their organization.
* It's not just about managing information; it's about unlocking its full potential in the most fun and captivating way possible.",2024-08-06,117,101

For a cute elevator-intro,¬†**Palantir Technologies ($PLTR \~ NYSE)**¬†was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen, with the mission to transform commercialized data analytics through the power of artificial intelligence.

The company develops software products for large institutions and government agencies that allows enormous data sets to be analyzed in just seconds.

Imagine blinking and you have a Pivot Table on Excel, except the data set is made up of a statewide census ü§Ø.

Looking at some basic financial valuations on the fundamental side, Palantir market cap is listed as $45 billion, while reeling in $2.21 billion in revenue in 2023 for a net income of $341 million. EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.

\^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.

After at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a ‚Äòbuy-and-hold‚Äô for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even [Zacks.com](http://Zacks.com), although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they‚Äôre likely to move in the same direction as the market.

Now, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don‚Äôt know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.

Moving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX‚Äôs stagnancy in the same period.

$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.

Palantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst‚Äôs projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.

Let‚Äôs size-up against the comp.  
  
Being in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.

Nonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.

However, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won‚Äôt be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o‚Äô Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.

The Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.

But the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I‚Äôm taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.

Artificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.

**The Set Up**

Plain and simple - we‚Äôre looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.

I pulled gap fill stats on PLTR for the last year to find what weekday and setup had the highest gap fill rate.

what I found was that in the past year, PLTR filled the gap 90% of the time on Monday's when the stock gapped down.

what this means is that if PLTR opens below Friday's closing price on Monday, it has touched Friday's closing price 90% of the time.

Potential good news for a stock that has a very high chance of materializing can get increasingly priced in even before any confirmation. 

S&P 500 inclusion is different in that it forces many index funds and institutions to buy in order to meet their mandate. However, given the uncertainty around PLTR I think that there will be an abundance of willing sellers to take profits from institutional buyers, leaving the stock flat or even down. Retail investors and some active managers are  scooping up PLTR for this very purpose, I think.

After S&P 500 inclusion people will start to get impatient about PLTR fulfilling its valuation with new clients and growing earnings. Failure to deliver within a quarter or two will see the stock correcting back to the low teens justified by its actual current earnings.",2023-11-25,87,63

So in the image above, I show 2023 q1 compared to 2022 q4.

In 2022 Q4 we had an operating loss and only went positive on GAAP EPS because of an ""Other Income"" line item which turned out to be a remeasurement of the PLTR Japan joint venture acquisition. When they said earnings were positive here, it was somewhat misleading because the operations netted a loss.

Now in 2023 Q1, we have positive operating income. This is a good thing!

We also see a trend from quarter to quarter where stock-based compensation is going down This is not a cash expense, but it does show up as an expense following generally accepted accounting principles. It's usually sprinkled through many different areas of expenses but does not have its own line item in the income statement. Seeing this line item reduced is a good thing because shareholders are not getting as heavily diluted.",2023-05-08,6,4

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY about **$468**, that corresponds to just above **$473** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.

But, I've been relooking at PLTR and wonder if anyone has any opinions of the two.

I'm not looking for a specific sector play - the two companies each present some strong cases, but AMD has a more proven upside, less down side risk.

PLTR is a more aggressive play with an unknown downside risk. It hasn't really shown much strength to me yet and can't seem to break out. Does anyone have bearish attitude to PLTR and would like to explain why?

Total value is 58 million. 

After winning contracts with a total deal value over 900 mil.usd last quarter, it seems that PLTR is again doing great, at least in the government segment. As you can see in the link that I have provided, since September 23rd a total of 11 new deals were completed. (new contracts, plus options that were exercised). It also looks like that they are not only forming new partnerships, but they are also strengthening their relationship with agencies that are already clients. For example, they have worked with the NHI since 2018, created a specialised platform for managing the vaccine distribution in 2020 for them and now their collaboration continues with this new contract. I am an investor in PLTR and I think that one of the most bullish indicators is the fact that their software ""sticks like glue"".

Position: long shares of stock @ $24.67 and have over doubled my position since Mar-21

TL;DR ‚Äì still bullish on PLTR and buying shares on down days. Financials improving each quarter. Waiting for the breakout.

My analysis primarily focuses on the financials of PLTR AFTER stripping out the Stock Based Compensation (SBC). For more background on this check my last post about it, but basically, I don‚Äôt believe the market should be putting so much weight on this when analyzing the financial health of the company: . Also, the fact that PLTR is allowed to present financial data in their 10-K & 10-Q filings after stripping out SBC shows that this is how the company should be analyzed. See previous post for more info on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why\_pltr\_is\_still\_a\_growth\_tech\_stock\_you\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lygxog/why_pltr_is_still_a_growth_tech_stock_you_still/)

Actuals = true GAAP results

Adjusted = financials after stripping out SBC

Anyways, here are the numbers and keep in mind that Q3-20 experienced abnormally high costs from when PLTR went public:

[Actual amounts including SBC \(Stock Based Compensation\)](https://preview.redd.it/f89bxnxotxk71.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=18c71e76d43e71627113286e8047fb92695908c8)

Revenue, COGS, Gross profit are all improving minus Q3-20 when the company experienced a significant amount of non-recurring costs due to its IPO. Revenue growth is still strong QoQ at 10.1% and 49% since Q2-20.

EBITDA is looking quite strong as this is now the 6th straight quarter of positive EBITDA. Additionally, EBITDA as a % of Revenue continues to grow which shows the company‚Äô ability to grow profitability as they scale.

[Actual Quarterly EBITDA](https://preview.redd.it/vcnaodw7uxk71.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c8a930914bf29e94fb2b50b30fd75c752cee62)

On an adjusted basis, Revenue and Gross Profit continues to expand while SG&A costs have remained constant:

[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/8sqbzt4cuxk71.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=abcddd88b75ca0201593b075c5c12cd5b5fd22ee)

To expand upon the adjusted costs of the company, PLTR is proving it is on the right track toward sustained profitability as their operating costs have remained constant while simultaneously expanding revenue and gross profit. This also means that the company is continuing to prove profitability as the costs as a % of revenue are trending lower and lower each period:

[Adjusted amounts](https://preview.redd.it/aifydkoguxk71.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=c70f95b7c4c2799ca9b1018a78ebd67f5390e410)

Lastly, EPS on an adjusted basis has been positive for the past 3 quarters:

https://preview.redd.it/co4bp5imuxk71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ae4ef1577f3f83c38c76935e3b094fd1a4a2f18

This was the first Quarter that PLTR has reported $0 debt and have $2.3B in cash ‚Äì quite impressive for a growth stock. Additionally, their current ratio and d/e ratios show no signs of liquidity/solvency issues (as expected).

In Summary: These posts don't generally focus on the qualitatives, but I have read almost nearly only great news about this company in the past 6 months yet the stock continues to get beaten down. The stock appears to be mainly being hurt due to 1) inflation fears, 2) differing opinions on valuation, and 3) stock based compensation criticism. However, none of these factors have an impact on the CORE operations of PLTR which I believe to be are extremely strong and all trending on the correct path. If long term investors can stay strong and continue to buy into this weakness, I think they will be happy they did so in 2-5 years‚Äô time. I will be curious to see if PLTR can break out of the 27.50 resistance or if it will fail that level and retest the low 20s again.

p0p40h_PLTR,PLTR,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD: PLTR, KHC, RVLV, SRNE, EAT","# Last Week‚Äôs Review

We‚Äôve hit some home-runs like AMD, CLF, and TLRY that were all up over 25% at peak and most other names were also slightly higher before growth names reversed to the downside at the end of last week.

The market is still in extremely choppy territory. We have potential lockdowns just around the corner and re-opening plays that are beating earnings expectations yet the stock price is reacting negatively. Furthermore, covid sweat-hearts like ETSY and PINS got absolutely WREKT on earnings after displaying a slowdown in user growth.

Why I keep these particular names on my watchlist and enter the play when it feels right is because a lot of them have already been hit hard over the last 2-3 months. The risk to the downside is less after a 30-40% correction. It‚Äôs also important to keep an eye on what the macro trends are: e-commerce, re-opening, re-closing, etc.

Last week it was all about Robinhood Markets (HOOD). FOMO traders who bought the top were quickly devastated when the stock dropped 30% just a few hours later. Here‚Äôs the chart.

https://preview.redd.it/eyiz0vtds7g71.png?width=2372&format=png&auto=webp&s=40668dc49ce5dcd46ed0da4ad8579e93f6985581

Anytime I see a stock go vertical like it did in the ‚Äúred zone‚Äù I outlined it automatically becomes a ‚Äúno-fly zone‚Äù for me. If I had shares before the moon landing, then that‚Äôs great and I will quickly take profits on a +20% day. To me, the red zone is another name for extreme FOMO. Any positions you enter here will be extremely risky and volatile and I prefer to preserve my capital. There are most likely hundreds of traders that bought HOOD at $75+ when it kept going up and up and up, that are now down 25% in just two trading days.

&#x200B;

The chart is too young to find a real trend, but I will keep this on my radar and re-visit this if it gets into the sub $45 territory.

&#x200B;

Let‚Äôs get into some of the names I found this week where it looks like the chart could be bottoming or nearing the bottom of an upward channel. There are a lot of fancy charting tools you can use, but I prefer FinViz because it‚Äôs more of a click-and-go type of chart where I can quickly access trend lines, support, moving averages, and chart patterns. I look at A LOT of charts over the weekend I so I can‚Äôt possibly do a full analysis on all.

&#x200B;

# The Meme List

I call this list the ‚Äúmeme‚Äù list not because they are bad companies, but because these stocks tend to get a lot of hype around social media and the internet. Sometimes hype around a ticker can be a huge driving force behind stock price and for these plays it‚Äôs better to get in early during calm periods before it becomes something like HOOD did last week. They say lightning never strikes twice, but meme stocks are exempt from this saying.

&#x200B;

**Palantir (PLTR)**

This is one of WallStreetBets most beloved stocks, or at least it was before it corrected nearly 50% from February highs. For the last 5-6 months it‚Äôs been trading between $21 and $25 with a few very brief moments at the $26 range. I don‚Äôt usually do earnings plays, but I like this stock for the long-term and entered a position last week (shares, not options). Earnings are coming up on August 12 (Thursday).

https://preview.redd.it/kbcrjk61t7g71.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd11d8a3b0d7bc1db6d19e114945a57bb965e2b1

&#x200B;

**Kraft Heinz (KHC)**

Everybody likes ketchup, right? This is an inflation play that has corrected itself with most commodities. The recent gap down was due to it‚Äôs earnings report last week which wasn‚Äôt bad and could be an over-reaction. Generally, I would like to wait and see how the stock reacts for a few days after a gap-down on earnings (or any news), but the price is favorable in my opinion for the risk to the downside versus reward to the upside.

Fun fact: Michael Burry initiated a position through his fund and the current stock price is most likely below his fund‚Äôs entry price.

# 

# The BTFD List (Buy The F***‚Äôn Dip)

This list is similar to the above except for the fact that these tickers don‚Äôt necessarily have much popularity on social media.

&#x200B;

**Revolve (RVLV)**

Revolve posted impressive revenue growth on earnings, but the stock price dropped on concerns over iOS privacy rules that are effecting advertisers. The 3-month trend was between the purple and blue lines (the ‚Äúchannel‚Äù), but has dropped below that point. In my opinion there are two possibilities here. First is that the drop was an over-reaction to the privacy news and the stock will regain the upward channel. This would mean the stock getting back into the $70s. The second possibility is a break-down of the share price where it would find support at $55. AKA stock may go up or stock may go down.

&#x200B;

**Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE)**

SRNE is a biotech company that shot up through the Gamestop hype to over $17 per share. It reversed down and has been trading at just about 8 bucks for several months. I don‚Äôt know enough about the company‚Äôs business model to comment on it, but this ticker comes up frequently on some finance-related social media channels I am on. Looking at the trend (blue and purple line), the share price is sitting at the bottom of the channel. I might enter a position and sell on any pop over $9.

https://preview.redd.it/qyg3cyx6t7g71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=57447afbed331c9456b98e978a9e4f8b091ab688

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Brinker International (EAT)**

It‚Äôs time to EAT, fam. This restaurant chain has been on a downtrend for 5 months, but might be nearing the January support of $54. What I like about this company is that it has a price-sales ratio of 0.85 and forward PE of 10. EAT‚Äôs market cap is 2.5 billion with 2.9 billion in revenues (low growth, low margin). I‚Äôll keep this on the radar next week and potentially enter a position.

okdjqk_PLTR,PLTR,Thoughts on PLTR?,"Hi, 

So, about couple of months ago, I decided to open a position in PLTR after doing some reading and thought it is a great company for the long term. 

I usually do DCA, but this time I put in as much as possible at once and let it sit. Kind of set and forget.

It took me about a month or so to be in the green and about couple of weeks ago I was up about 15% or so. 

Thought of closing the position and taking the profit, but decided to stick to my long term view.

However, these days the stock is deeply in the red for me like 9.3%. 

Should I have closed the position when I had the chance and reinvested in dividend stocks perhaps? 

Or keeping it open was the right thing to do?

* Adjusted free cash flow of $151 million, up $441 million year-over-year, and representing a 44% margin
* GAAP net loss per share, diluted of $(0.07)
* Adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04
* Cash and cash equivalents- 2.3 billion
* The company managed to pay almost all of its outstanding long-term debt

These numbers look amazing,especially when you take into account the fact that as the management stated numerous times on the earnings call, the company is just starting to expand and acquire new customers. Many people think of Palantir as this old, mature company that is still unprofitable and with limited growth opportunities. The thing is that despite being 17 years old, Palantir is just starting to get recognition on the world stage. They spent years just developing their software and investing heavily into R and D( over 2 billion dollars). Foundry was launched in 2018 and already is experiencing very high-levels of adoption despite the fact that it is a very complex and expensive software( It is way easier to grow your revenue and acquire new customers on a quarter basis when you are selling cheap and rather simple software solutions, not a complete OS for businesses) . PLTR is also just starting to build a proper sales team ( more than 50 new salespeople hired in this quarter alone) and partnering with organizations like IBM that can pinch their soft. to potential customers. The only slightly negative thing is the fact that currently their european commercial business growth is lacking behind the U.S one, but it is mostly because european economic recovery from the Covid pandemic is way slower. They still managed to close some deals and on the earnings call announcead a new client in Peugeot. Also the Covid crisis definitely helped PLTR in a way, but this does not mean that we should expect a slower growth rate in the future, but qute the opposite. For example, video game manufacturers experienced huge growth during the pandemic, because people stayed at home and had nothing better to do, but that would not be the case in the future. On the other hand, the pandemic helped companies to realise how important is for them to be able to make sense of their large databases of unfiltered information and make better-informed decisions to protect their operations from future geopolitical or macro-economic events.

Palantir is also well positioned to increase their revenue significantly in the government sector, due to the fact that their Gotham software proved its worth throughout the years and they just started their AI based Appolo software.( The Biden admin will apparently invest billions in AI technologies in the coming years).

I would not dive deep into other financial metrics, cuz this DD will become too large, but their margins are insane, cost of revenue grew way,way less than actual revenue, adjusted free cash flow is now positive( insane growth also, wink, wink to all analyst who use DCF) and PLTR somehow managed to expand its business operations while at the same time increasing their cash at hand and having almost non-existent debt.

Let's adress some retail investors worries now. WSB and r/ PLTR are constantly complaining about the high amounts of SBC the employees receive. They of course talked about this on the earnings call and the CFO said that the SBC will normalise in the future( very common for growth companies), but they will still give SBC to employess to align their personal interest with interest of the company ( also very common, especially for soft.companies) and to have more cash for expansion and future investments. Also, they said that Alex Karp is selling shares for tax purposes and he plans to continue being one of the biggest shareholders in the future.

A lot of people also complain about the fact that ""the management does not believe in the company, Karp told me to sell my shares"". The truth is that their believe is actually a bit cult-like. Management again stated that they are convinced of the fact that PLTR will become the most important software company in the future and they even literally said that they are a "" few steps away form becoming Skynet"". Furthermore, they invested in Lillium and Sarcos robotics, cuz they think that it is an incredible opportunity for an innovative startup to use Foundry from ground-zero and not waste years of its development having to deal with data silos and so on. When talking specifically about Sarcos, they said that their are vision for Foundry is to become a digital ""IronMan suit"" and Sarcos is trying to build a physical ""IronMan"" suit and they want to combine their efforts. Yes, that is right. Management thinks that their software is so good, that instead of just selling it to other companies, they can just invest in startups, give their soft for free and reap even bigger rewards in the future.

Another interesting thing we learned from the conference call is that PLTR accepts (the currency that rhymes with groin) as a form of payment. Investing in PLTR is giving you some indirect exposure to the ""forbidden word"" market.

In conclusion, I want to say that my personal opinion is that PLTR's fundamentals actually became better and as Jeff Bezos said the stock price does not always reflect the state of the company correctly. If you did not FOMO into PLTR expecting it to moon immediatly it is probably better to just wait and stick to your conviction that the company's financials will justify its generous valuation in the coming years.",2021-05-11,1224,299

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir‚Äôs 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir‚Äôs infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir‚Äôs software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir‚Äôs Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the ‚ÄúDigital Twin‚Äù is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

so. here¬¥s my thought process. I really do believe in he company long term. but I hate having cash locked up in positions that do not yield anything in return. 

I am considering selling at a loss right now, to reinvest into some stock with more short term upsides. anything that beats covid drops or i alredy in the process of recovering. after making up the loss with that I would re-enter at current prices. then resume long term holding. 

I would buy more to average out lower , but all  my other positions seem to work out decent.

lygxog_PLTR,PLTR,Why PLTR is still a growth tech stock you STILL want to own.,"*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, make your own decisions. Data from PLTR's latest 10-K. Position: long shares of stock)*

Despite this appearing to be possibly the worst time to own growth stocks, especially in tech, I think there is still a great opportunity in Palantir (PLTR). The market sell-off has depressed PLTR‚Äôs stock price ($21.75 at time of writing) to be currently trading at a 51% discount from its $45.00 high just a few weeks ago. The broader market sell-off creates a unique opportunity to buy shares of a company with leading technology and improving financials. 

If you believe in PLTR‚Äôs technology I‚Äôm not sure why you wouldn‚Äôt want to own this stock right now at these levels. This post will focus more on the numbers and less on the technology (which I do believe to be superior but I‚Äôll save that for a different post). 

When analyzing PLTR on GAAP metrics, the numbers are good, but not fantastic. You must remove 2 things to really get a true grasp of their core business, 1) Q3-20 should be adjusted due to the company incurring much higher than normal costs as they went public and, 2) removing the effects of stock based compensation. When you do this the company‚Äôs numbers are actually MUCH stronger than they appear under normal GAAP metrics. From here on, charts labeled ‚ÄúActual‚Äù refer to the actual amounts reported while ‚ÄúAdjusted‚Äù refer to those metrics less the effects of stock based comp.

**Revenue/COGS/Gross Profit**: as pictured in the chart revenue is growing very well QoQ and only saw inflated COGS in Q3-20 (when the company went public - this will be a common theme). 

[Actual amounts with effects of stock based comp ](https://preview.redd.it/uxfwfxd0o8l61.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f4ea699fac42dcafd6a7026761d69857a18f7ad)

When you remove Stock comp from the mix (as clearly outlined in their 10-K btw) you can see COGS is more in line with its historical trends (see below).  You can also see Gross Profit margins improving as well as the company scales (VERY positive). 

[\(COGS in line with historical trend\)](https://preview.redd.it/8kp2605ho8l61.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=13181cb96b119fc84bc25e2b22f1c567238a6408)

[\(Quarterly gross margins improving\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ayolltno8l61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50f46e940b15e942dbc4820bcdf0ec537a5ec02)

Additionally, PLTR has expanded both its Revenue from Commercial clients (21.5% YoY) and from Government clients (76.6% YoY) bringing the split of revenue from Commercial to Government to 44.2% and 55.8% respectively. 

&#x200B;

**Operating Expense:** when you look at Opex you can see expenses ballooned in Q3-20 as the company incurred additional costs of going public, but when you remove those costs, the core business is much more attractive. (see below)

&#x200B;

[\(Inflated Q3-20 expenses due to going public\)](https://preview.redd.it/10jct0dbp8l61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14f18f3aed6a71da25f0390af734e8a8f83047c)

When you remove stock comp from the mix we see a much more consistent trend of opex:

&#x200B;

[\(Opex after removing effects of stock based comp\)](https://preview.redd.it/adb8557rp8l61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=52aecad3f24fe7ce37cd265b95c1f738a131f592)

It's important to note that Revenue increasing and opex staying relatively stable is having a very strong effect on margins. Just look at opex as a % of revenue (see below). Revenue growth is significantly outpacing costs of the core business:

&#x200B;

[\(Adjusted Opex as a &#37; of Revenue\)](https://preview.redd.it/918ibf25q8l61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a70eb4af78f9d379ed652ef73fd0c0daefd3a6)

Put this all together and you can see how PLTR's core business is looking strong and just over the peak of breaking even on a non-gaap basis: 

&#x200B;

[\(Adjusted: Revenue, GP, Inc\/Loss from Ops, Net Inc\/Loss\)](https://preview.redd.it/mr310uohq8l61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf1d150086dc99ab663f34ec64ddc896795e1c0)

**And Quarterly EBITDA (see blelow):** Growing EBITDA in absolute terms as well as a % of Revenue. 

&#x200B;

[\(EBITDA by Quarter\)](https://preview.redd.it/kjja0gcuq8l61.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=809a09e93536849945270e0d4f60db11c9e0559d)

Overall, this company is profitable on a non-gaap basis and is trading an EXTREME discount from its previous highs. Of course rising rates and inflation concerns are something to factor in, but the financials of this company are sound imo and offer a great buying opportunity at this level. If I had spare cash I'd be buying into this weakness.

ly5dfu_IBM,IBM,Palantir is the best long run $PLTR,,2021-03-05,574,338
ly5dfu_PLTR,PLTR,Palantir is the best long run $PLTR,"TL, DR: $PLTR is **a huge long play** and the company has its toes dipped in essentially every single industry.

Here are some fundamentals: market cap 44.6bn, 2020 revenue 1.1bn (482m from commercial, 618m from the government), and consistent earnings beat. 

In 2020, their revenue increased by 47% and they signed 21 contracts during Q4 2020 (21 in 13 weeks = **avg 2 contracts a week last quarter**) and they are working with 8 companies of Fortune 100, 12 of Global 100, and 24 of Global 300 (LARGE potential growth in the future).

From 2019 to 2020 they increased their revenue from the commercial sector by **107%.** This is very important as the commercial sector is where they will profit from the most. 

Palantir currently has two products Gotham and Foundry, with Gotham being used mostly by the US government and Foundry is for the commercial sector. Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer's existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. 

A few of the big names that are working with them now is **IBM**, **PG&E**, **BP**, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with **NHS England** where they are working to handle vaccine allocation **(**this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession**)**

They have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran's nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is **one of the four** institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is *project Maven*. Essentially Palantir is the CIA's AI twin.

Looking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.

Lots of words below, so here‚Äôs the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir‚Äôs products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it‚Äôs going where no clouds have gone before‚Ä¶ from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a‚Ä¶

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don‚Äôt have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir ‚Äì BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they‚Äôre in, I‚Äôm in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I‚Äôll self dox myself. I‚Äôm Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I‚Äôm a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I‚Äôm not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don‚Äôt kink shame. [Here‚Äôs a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S√∂ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I‚Äôm not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it‚Äôs built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce‚Äôs Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn‚Äôt ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google‚Äôs back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‚Äò*****Find the Terrorist*****‚Äô to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‚Äòcheat code for war,‚Äô and I think that is spot on. That‚Äôs why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I‚Äôll keep it short. It‚Äôs a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I‚Äôd give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I‚Äôve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I‚Äôm not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*¬∑ I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*¬∑ It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*¬∑ I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*¬∑ I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here‚Äôs a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‚Äò*killed it*,‚Äô you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir‚Äôs products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‚Äòdecision‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision makers.‚Äô

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what‚Äôs more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft‚Äôs market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus‚Äôs dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn‚Äôt make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That‚Äôs absolutely bonkers and that‚Äôs why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they‚Äôre airworthy when we need them. Since we don‚Äôt know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when ‚Äúbig events‚Äù (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives ‚Äì do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin‚Äô Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can‚Äôt state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can‚Äôt scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir ‚Äì PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I‚Äôm not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don‚Äôt truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts‚Äì whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you‚Äôve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I‚Äôm largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it‚Äôs own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I‚Äôm not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I‚Äôm skeptical that I‚Äôll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That‚Äôs my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

lih9ki_PLTR,PLTR,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry this is wrong in the title). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom. Would love to know all your thoughts as well.

**What Does Palantir Do?**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization‚Äôs various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir‚Äôs software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and¬†rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir‚Äôs customers is Skywise, an¬†aviation platform that has become the central operating¬†system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company‚Äôs value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company‚Äôs total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir‚Äôs business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir‚Äôs expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer‚Äôs key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially¬†using Palantir‚Äôs software for its operations and Palantir can also¬†upsell to the customer by continually¬†offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,¬†In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what‚Äôs known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir‚Äôs rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir‚Äôs Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it‚Äôs used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir‚Äôs platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir‚Äôs top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to¬†grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the¬†company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir‚Äôs differentiated services and business model is one of the company‚Äôs key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company‚Äôs revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir‚Äôs business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of¬†concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don‚Äôt think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir‚Äôs growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn‚Äôt foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir‚Äôs management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the¬†company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be¬†more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I‚Äôm adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade
   * The remaining 80% is available to trade starting February 19th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the¬†company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a¬†company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue¬†growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average¬†revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and¬†government revenue by 68%
   * With all this¬†said, one piece of concern in Palantir‚Äôs income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is¬†that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially¬†near break-even
   * However, the company‚Äôs free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company‚Äôs valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I‚Äôm Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities. What do you think?",2021-02-12,188,56
lih6ee_PLTR,PLTR,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry I got the day wrong in the title but the date 2/16 is correct). Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn‚Äôt realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization‚Äôs various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir‚Äôs software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and¬†rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir‚Äôs customers is Skywise, an¬†aviation platform that has become the central operating¬†system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company‚Äôs value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company‚Äôs total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir‚Äôs business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir‚Äôs expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer‚Äôs key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially¬†using Palantir‚Äôs software for its operations and Palantir can also¬†upsell to the customer by continually¬†offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,¬†In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**

      * While I don‚Äôt think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir‚Äôs growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn‚Äôt foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir‚Äôs management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the¬†company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be¬†more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I‚Äôm adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the¬†company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a¬†company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue¬†growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average¬†revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and¬†government revenue by 68%
   * With all this¬†said, one piece of concern in Palantir‚Äôs income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is¬†that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially¬†near break-even
   * However, the company‚Äôs free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company‚Äôs valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I‚Äôm Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

Edit: wow did not expect this to blow up! I‚Äôm pretty new to posting on Reddit and will continue to post my DD. Also thank you for some who called out anything incorrect in my research.

lim9dk_IBM,IBM,PLTR DD - brain cells required if you are an ape!,"Hello fellow retards

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it‚Äôs almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let‚Äôs start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it‚Äôs ended? Well Peter‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.‚Äù

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What‚Äôs next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I‚Äôm not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

I am in the PLTR subs but I want to hear people's take from both sides with no confirmation bias. Thus, I would appreciate people's thoughts and outlook on this stock?",2021-02-07,297,156

kpy4sr_SNOW,SNOW,IPO Price Predictions [DASH - ABNB - SNOW - PLTR],"Hey day traders,

In my most recent YT video, I took a quick look into DASH, ABNB, SNOW, and PLTR, using support & resistance, fibonacci retracements, trend lines, and parallel channels to help predict the next major move in each.

If you want to watch, you can check it out here! [https://youtu.be/ALGJG28DTQY](https://youtu.be/ALGJG28DTQY)

And of course, if you have any feedback, comments, or questions, I'd love to hear them!

**TLDR VERSION**

**DASH**: Currently in a declining wedge, and a break-out above it (and above \~147), would be an excellent long signal to play towards all time highs

**ABNB**: I'm looking for a long entry some time very soon on ABNB, ideally around $140. My first price target would be upwards of $190

**SNOW**: I'm looking for just a little bit more downside of SNOW, to around $270-276, before an awesome long entry may show up

**PLTR**: I'm looking for a bit more downside on PLTR as well, ideally to about $18. Once we get there, I'd have an extremely bullish stance on PLTR to upside targets of potentially $58.",2021-01-04,0,0

My thought was to hold all calls up until Q4 Earnings, sell my 25C, 30C positions prior and exercise as many 20C contracts as I can afford in May.

Probably use the cash from the sales on CSP between Q4 Earnings and May 21st

k2z3op_PLTR,PLTR,"If PLTR hits $40 in the next 2 weeks, I'm leaving the girlfriend I live with.","There's really nothing more to say. I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'.

Honestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.

One day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.

Pissed, I ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'.

First off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little ""salary"" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a relationship where one person pays for two.

I was pissed to hell.

There was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron shorts it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options).

***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***

It relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't hit $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support, because of our cohabitation agreement, but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word.

It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision.

So her, that 'rental' guy, Jim Cramer, and CITRON can go suck my hard, throbbing cock because PLTR is making 50k liters of blood gush into it every time it goes up. Goodbye and I'll see you Monday when that shit pumps to the moon and beyond.",2020-11-29,14030,1675

k2w1ep_PLTR,PLTR,Adjusting PLTR strategy,"I'm looking back at Friday and realizing that it's possibly time for a strategy adjustment with my PLTR position. Overall, I am long-term very bullish. I know there is a number of corrections coming, but my time window is late 2021 to settle closer to a target of 100.  But I think that I can optimize my current position better:

* Jan 2021 15c
* May 2021 11c and 15c
* Shares (approx. 1.5x exposure vs options)

Options were picked up when PLTR was around 10-11, my entry for shares was around 15. Given the huge run-up in volatility last week, I'd expect some form of IV crush over the next couple of weeks.

My longer-term goal is to roll into a larger position with 2023 40c (or similar). Options are my primary means of leverage because, frankly, I hate margin. A couple of questions:

1. What kind of vega exposure will I get if I roll my position out? It feels like deep ITM and deep OTM calls should relatively vega hedge as I will have a larger position at the higher strike.
2. I stopped myself from delta hedging Friday afternoon. Any thoughts on loading up with some ATM puts on Monday if PLTR continues to retreat?
3. What's the value in changing over some of my shares for LEAPs? As this is my primary means of leverage, that seems to be the only way that I can grow the position. I would run the wheel on PLTR - but with all the volatility that doesn't seem wise.",2020-11-28,19,49

I happened to dig into their quarterly report, and will most likely look at their SEC filing as well considering this tidbit I found. But before I do that, I'm curious as to whether y'all have any thoughts on this. 

They paid themselves the amount they lost last quarter. For the life of me, I can't pin down any concrete thoughts on this. I can imagine anything from total hubris on their prospects, to a total exploitation of their IPO to just pay themselves. The most likely answer is a combination of these things I'm thinking. 

Honestly, as long as I've been investing, I've never bet on a company with this kind of dynamic. I'm more in line with the Lisa Sus and Stewart Butterfields of the world--those less brazen and, quite frankly, with higher moral standards. I did grapple with this investment. In the end, money is emotionless, and I'm not going to change the fact that, in my opinion, the American government will make Palantir one of the biggest defense contractors of all time, up there with Raytheon and Lockheed. (My hedge is that they're growing in the commercial sector anyway.) There's a war with China going on and it's happening under the ocean. To the world's detriment, I think it will only intensify over time. 

That being said, I'm thinking Palantir's execs just wanted a payday. At the same time it seems...petty, is the word? I don't know. I really can't figure this one.",2020-11-18,162,98

Offering: 257,135,415 Shares

Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us under which they cannot sell, offer, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose of shares of our capital stock, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction or arrangement that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition or transfer of any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our capital stock, until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the ‚Äúlock-up period‚Äù), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions.

Starting on the first day of trading, the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreements will no longer apply to (i) an aggregate of 383,609,647 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68,149,214 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units. The remaining 1,863,150,291 shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be able to be sold after the lock-up period, subject to applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. In addition, certain record holders subject to market standoff agreements with us have not signed the lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period. If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, up to an additional 37,369,371 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period. 89,007,617 shares held by our Founders and their affiliates will be permitted to be sold immediately under the Founders‚Äô lock-up agreements and will be registered for resale pursuant to the registration statement...""

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/: ‚ÄúOne part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.‚Äù

‚ÄúPalantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.‚Äù


******

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read ""Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us"" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this? 
******
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade? 
******
4) ANSWERED Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)? 

Found this: https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting
So basically all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

******
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded). 
******
6) 6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:
https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements/default.aspx
As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir‚Äôs market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (‚ÄúRSUs‚Äù). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?


BIG PICTURE: On or around 2/17/21 (3 mons and 3 trading session after Q3 earnings release) what would be impact on stock? I can't imagine all insiders duping every share (although would seemingly retain control if choose to retain very few), but valuation was rumored around $50-60 Billion for past few years even before incredible run in tech. With stock now above 19 and EV ~35B, if valuation approaches what Thiel et al seeming hoped for in next three months would they be expected to flood the market with shares? Then again they approved lockup? I don't understand.",2020-11-18,29,23

I have seen that they have made a contract with an oil company which will help that oil company save around $1B.

I know that PLTR is being extensively supported by the US govt and they won't enter the Chinese market, which means this company is never going bankrupt.

And knowing Peter Thiel, this could be something huge.

All I want to understand from you guys is how big a market PLTR is actually playing in? Which other companies do you think will eat PLTRs lunch(MSFT and AMZN seem very likely)?
