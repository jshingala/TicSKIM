1kspmve_PYPL,PYPL,"Are insider purchases still a reliable signal in 2025? Recent cases from Intel, PayPal, and Alibaba","For years, I’ve followed a strategy that combines classic fundamental analysis with insider buying activity (from executives and board members), using tools like Dataroma. It has worked reasonably well, but lately I’ve noticed many insiders buying during downturns without a clear recovery, and in several cases they seem to be getting trapped—at least in the short to medium term.

Some recent examples:

Intel (INTC): In April 2025, CEO Pat Gelsinger bought 11,150 shares for around $251,000. However, the stock has remained under pressure due to strong competition in the semiconductor space and acquisition rumors.

PayPal (PYPL): While there haven't been recent insider buys, the company has launched initiatives like “Agentic Commerce” and is showing signs of profitability recovery. Still, the stock hasn’t taken off meaningfully.

Alibaba (BABA): In Q1 2025, major institutions like FMR LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their stakes. However, the stock faces challenges due to regulatory scrutiny, especially after its AI partnership with Apple in China came under fire.


Do you still consider insider activity a useful signal in today’s market, where narrative and momentum seem to dominate? Or do you think insiders aren’t as reliable a value indicator as they once were?",2025-05-22,6,13

1jwx3qv_AXP,AXP,PayPals future under CEO Alex Chriss,"I know PayPal is hated here.  But I wrote a report on why I think CEO Alex Chriss is going to transform PayPal from the ground up.  

Warning: long post

Here is why Chriss is pivotal to Paypals future success

1. History at intuit 
Alex Chriss made significant contributions to Intuit during his 19-year tenure from 2004 to 2023.  

As general manager and executive vice president of the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, he was a key driver of innovation and growth.

His customer-centric approach, focus on simplifying financial management, and strategic vision for small business empowerment solidified Intuit’s position as a fintech leader. His work laid a foundation for sustainable growth. 

2. Transforming Quickbooks
Chriss led the evolution of QuickBooks from a desktop-based software to a cloud-based platform, making it more accessible and relevant in a digital economy. 

He integrated AI and machine learning to enhance functionality, improving user experience for millions of small businesses.

3. Launching QuickBooks Self Employed
Chriss spearheaded the creation of QuickBooks Self-Employed, targeting freelancers and independent contractors. 

This product became Intuit’s fastest-growing offering, helping hundreds of thousands manage expenses and tax obligations efficiently.

4. Developing the QuickBooks App Store and Partner Platform
Chriss established Intuit’s platform-as-a-service strategy, launching the QuickBooks App Store and Partner Platform. 

These enabled developers to create apps that integrate with QuickBooks, expanding its ecosystem and allowing small businesses to access hundreds of tailored solutions.

5. Leading QuickBooks Financing Business
He drove Intuit’s QuickBooks Financing business, providing small businesses with easier access to capital through lower rates and faster application processes, supporting millions in their growth.

6. Acquiring Mailchimp
In 2021, Chriss orchestrated Intuit’s $12 billion acquisition of Mailchimp, significantly expanding Intuit’s platform to include marketing tools. This move broadened QuickBooks’ capabilities, helping small and mid-sized businesses with customer analytics and growth strategies.

7. Driving Growth
Under his leadership, the Small Business and Self-Employed Group saw a compound annual growth rate of 20% in customers and 23% in revenue over five years.

Chris was managing an 8,000-person team that delivered QuickBooks to over 8 million customers and Mailchimp to 13 million users globally.

Intuits stock performance over that period speaks for itself

8. How does this affect PayPal?

""Our vision is for PayPal to be the commerce platform powering the global economy""

Under Chriss's leadership, PayPal has embarked on a transformative journey to expand beyond traditional payment processing.  

By leveraging his extensive experience in technology and product development during his nearly 20 years at Intuit, he is steering the company towards a more integrated and customer-focused future, expanding its footprint in both digital and physical payment landscapes.

I will now talk about some of the new initiatives Chriss has introduced, which I believe are largely drawn from his vast experience at Intuit. 

9. Fastlane
Fastlane is a one-click guest checkout solution introduced by CEO Alex Chriss as part of his push to streamline e-commerce and boost merchant conversions. It’s designed to simplify the checkout process for customers who don’t want to create accounts or log in, addressing a major pain point in online shopping where cart abandonment often spikes due to slow or cumbersome payment flows.

By vastly increasing the convenience of transacting with PayPal, the problems faced by legacy branded checkout are virtually erased.  

Speaking from personal experience, having to enter your details manually for payment every time you go to a website is cumbersome.  It might not sound like much, but trust me this makes a huge difference to customer interaction.

Previously this aspect held branded checkout back due to poor user experience.  That is no longer the case here with Fastlane.


10. In person payment solutions
In addition to enhancing online services, Chriss has directed PayPal's entry into in-person payment solutions. 

Chriss has driven PayPal into physical retail with moves like integrating its debit card with Apple Pay and offering 5% cashback to attract users. 

The PayPal Everywhere initiative encourages app-based spending, aiming to capture a slice of the growing point-of-sale market. 

A partnership with Verifone also combines PayPal’s payment processing with in-store hardware for a seamless omnichannel experience.

The ability to use PayPal in person changes the game.  They are no longer just an online player.

Paypal now has the full set of options which allow it to be “Paypal everywhere” 

The financial tool in your pocket to be used whenever and wherever you are

11. PayPal Open
PayPal Open is essentially a framework that lets merchants plug PayPal’s capabilities
like; payments, payouts, financing and analytics into their websites, apps, or in-store systems without needing to overhaul their tech stack. 

It’s built to be interoperable, meaning it works with a variety of e-commerce platforms, and third-party tools. The goal is to make PayPal a central hub for commerce operations, reducing friction for merchants and improving the experience for consumers.

Everyone is a winner here.  By focussing on the merchant as well as the consumer experience, PayPal is creating an ever growing loyalty base of satisfied customers on both sides of the transaction. 

12. AI and Personalization
Chriss is already well versed in the benefits and potential of AI as a result of his experience at Inutit.

He is now bringing that knowledge to PayPal.  

This will create smarter analytics for targeted marketing (like PayPal Ads) and optimise transaction flows.  It will make the whole experience more personal and more efficient.

This further increases the customer and merchant experience quality, driving satisfaction and loyalty. 

13. Crypto and Web3 Exploration 
PayPal has expanded its crypto offerings under Chriss, adding support for tokens like Solana and Chainlink for U.S. customers. 

While not aiming to become a full crypto exchange, PayPal is experimenting with blockchain tech, including its stablecoin PYUSD, to stay relevant in Web3 and reduce international payment fees.

Harnessing this strategy, PayPal can position itself for future generations who will be more crypto savvy and much more likely to want to use it for transactions (especially internationally) 

It’s an extra tool in the box and forms the complete set of options available in the e-commerce platform Chriss has envisioned.

14. Paypal Ads 
PayPal Ads is an advertising network that uses PayPal’s extensive data on consumer purchases and spending patterns to deliver personalized ads. 

It capitalizes on PayPal’s 429 million+ active accounts and data from billions of transactions, in order to offer advertisers unique insights and targeting capabilities. 

The platform spans PayPal’s ecosystem, and aims to expand to external merchant sites.

This segment is being led by Mark Grether, a seasoned market executive who grew Ubers ad business to $1 billion and also led Amazons ad strategy. 

What a choice.

This segment has massive future potential for high margin revenue growth.  Who knows how much extra profitable growth this could generate in a few years time

It has not long launched in the US, with plans to expand internationally this year 

15. Conclusion
Chriss is an experienced and talented operator.

His previous knowledge and experience from Inuit is being employed to transform PayPal into a one stop shop for physical and online commerce.

He has surrounded himself with an amazing team drawn from multiple sectors and specialisms who he is able to put to work on the vision he is working to make a reality.

If you look at what he achieved at intuit, you can already see how he is using that blueprint to vastly improve Paypal from the ground up.

Don’t judge him by the stock price.  He has no control over that.

Judge him by what he has already achieved and his future performance

He will execute 

He will outperform 

All he needs is time 

Those patient enough to wait will be rewarded

It’s pumping out $6.5B in free cash flow yearly (10% yield), yet trades at a forward P/E of 13, a steal for a 430M-user payments titan. Competition’s a myth; its 40% market share holds strong. 

Plus, $6B in buybacks is shrinking the float fast.

1j1yyv7_PYPL,PYPL,Current thoughts on PYPL? (PayPal),"I’ve been digging around trying to find some solid value picks to complement my portfolio. And I’ve been keeping an eye on PayPal for quite sometime. I used to have a decent position in it before but decided to cut ties. This has been a couple years now. 

But now I’m checking it out again and it seems pretty damn solid for where it’s currently at. Am I missing something? Nearly all metrics seem very strong fundamentally. But I’m curious as to what the bear case is? What’s hindering the company so much? 

Because as I look at the company, it’s roughly 70B in overall valuation. Revenue continues to keep going up each year. (About 12% average over the last 3 years. Which is respectable.) They’re planning to buy an awful lot of shares back. (Based on what I’ve read $15-$20B worth over the coming years.) about $5B (give or take 1B or so.) back last year alone. The company is generating good cash flows of about $4-6B a year. If you throw the buy backs on top that’s some serious value back. 

To me, looking at the cash flow and revenue trend, the balance sheet, cash on hand, the massive buybacks, and everything else in between else just seems like a screaming buy. I don’t see many companies out there with this kind of presumptive value discrepancy. What are your thoughts? I’m personally seriously considering opening a position again for the long term.

1innoj3_PYPL,PYPL,Need Advice on PYPL Assignment & GOOG Roll Strategy After Recent Hits (SP),"Hey,

Looking for some input after the recent market hits.

I’ve been selling puts, and here’s where I stand:
I got assigned 300 shares of PYPL at $86. Ended up buying back the other 2 puts for a loss to prevent further downside exposure. CCs are barely paying pennies right now, making it hard to generate meaningful premium. Other than just waiting for a recovery above $86, is there any strategy you’d recommend to manage this position more effectively?

I’ve also got 5 open contracts on GOOG at $195 strike, which I already rolled from last Friday to this week’s expiry. Planning to roll them again to 2/21 and down to a $192.5 strike to cut losses gradually. What’s everyone’s take on GOOG’s recovery potential in the near term? Does this roll strategy make sense, or should I be considering other approaches?

1iij792_PYPL,PYPL,**Thesis: Why You Should Go Bullish on PayPal Right Now**,"Let’s talk about why jumping on PayPal (PYPL) is a no-brainer as of February 5, 2025.

1. **Totally Oversold**: PayPal’s stock has taken a hit lately, and it’s trading at a discount. When the market overreacts and pushes the price down, that’s a prime chance for a bounce back. Think of this as buying low before it starts to soar!

2. **Earnings Report was Fire**: PayPal just dropped some impressive earnings, showing solid revenue growth and profitability. This kind of performance usually gets investors hyped and sets the stage for a rally. If people realize how strong the fundamentals are, they’ll start buying up shares.

3. **Massive $15 Billion Buyback**: PayPal just announced a huge $15 billion share buyback. What does this mean? Fewer shares means higher earnings per share (EPS), which is like throwing gasoline on the fire! It shows that the management is all-in on boosting shareholder value, and that’s usually a recipe for price appreciation.",2025-02-05,57,102

1hkk4wp_PYPL,PYPL,Recent Honey controversy a bearish warning for $PYPL,"Honey has been accused of intercepting and overriding affiliate links, stealing commissions from influencers and content creators who promote their products. When users click through Honey to make a purchase, the commission that should go to the influencers is redirected to Honey instead.

If the controversy escalates with legal actions or if more influencers publicly distance themselves from Honey, PayPal's brand could suffer, potentially affecting stock value over time. However, PayPal's diverse portfolio might mitigate some of these effects since Honey is just one part of their business.

In 2019, Honey was expected to generate about $200 million in revenue, whereas PayPal's revenue for the same period was much larger. If the recent news is able to tank Honeys revenue it will likely not impact PayPal long term. 

For the short term I will hold a bearish sentiment, and I’m curious to what other investors think.

From the huge decline to now, the revenues of PayPal have consistently grown like clock work.



At the beginning of the year their Free cash flow started growing like crazy. And sure, it's already shown up in their price a bit. Maybe this is priced in already.



But I doubt it because it's trading at the lowest multiple it's probably had in its entire history.

The stock appears to be undervalued, even as its revenue continues to climb to all-time highs. With the new CEO focusing on improving operations and reducing stock-based compensation, there seems to be a renewed effort to create shareholder value.



The last point I'll say is that even though their stock has gone up like 30% this year it's still trailing far behind free cashflow growth and Q4 is a big one for payment platforms.

It is still extremely undervalued.  Do your own DD.   

I am not here to provide a detailed valuation breakdown.  

There are plenty of credible valuations out there that can do a far better job than me.  

I assess it’s fair value at around $130 based on my own research.  Fair valuations range from $55 to $180.  Which shows the limited use of set valuation formulas.  They require assumptions.  Assumptions you should make yourself after researching the company.  

I am posting this as an opportunity for people who were not aware of PayPal.  

As a quick recap; 
- New CEO and management team.  They are proving to be extremely effective at making PayPal into a profitable growth company once again. 
- Buybacks at a low valuation.  An excellent use of capital and at this stage, much more effective than a dividend.  
- Multiple new revenue streams opening up which are currently unrealised.  (Fast lane, Advertising) 
- A raft of high profile partnerships which have recently been established including a restart of the partnership with Amazon which was lost in the last year.

1fc1qja_PYPL,PYPL,$PYPL discussion,"I’ve been analyzing PayPal recently, and I’ve put together a detailed report discussing its current financial situation, leadership transition, competition, and potential growth. PayPal’s shift under its new CEO Alex Chriss, alongside the competitive pressure from Apple Pay and Google Pay, makes this a fascinating stock to watch. It’s clear that PayPal still holds a lot of potential, but I’d love to open up a debate here: What’s your take on PayPal as a long-term investment? Do you think its current valuation offers a buying opportunity, or are the challenges too significant? Let’s dive into the pros, cons, and what the future could hold for this fintech giant. Feel free to share your insights!

**Summary:**

• PayPal has been navigating intense competition from tech giants such as Apple and Google, but remains focused on strategic transformation and innovation.

• Despite challenges, PayPal has been improving its profitability and raising its full-year guidance, driven by its focus on customer experience and technological enhancements.

• Under the new leadership of CEO Alex Chriss, PayPal is positioning itself for sustainable long-term growth in a competitive payments market.

**1. Introduction**

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a global leader in digital payments, offering secure and innovative solutions for both consumers and businesses across 200 markets. Over the years, PayPal has played a pivotal role in the growth of e-commerce and the digital payments ecosystem. However, as competition heats up with the entry of Apple Pay and Google Pay into the market, PayPal is in the midst of a transformation.

Venmo, one of PayPal’s most popular products, has remained a favorite among younger generations, but the broader competitive landscape now includes integrated payment solutions from Apple and Google, which offer seamless checkout experiences directly tied to their devices. These competitors are giving PayPal a hard time, mainly because their payment systems are pre-installed on devices, allowing them to capture customers effortlessly.

**2. Current Financial Situation**

In its latest earnings release, PayPal reported an 8% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2024, reaching $7.9 billion . Total payment volume (TPV) also increased by 11%, driven by growth in branded checkout and Venmo . While the company’s net revenue is increasing, gross margins have been squeezed due to a pivot towards lower-margin products like white-label services .

The non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) increased 36% year-over-year to $1.19 , and PayPal has raised its full-year profit guidance, reflecting the company’s confidence in its future performance and ongoing initiatives.

**3. Challenges and Strategic Response**

One of the biggest challenges PayPal faces comes from Apple Pay and Google Pay, which are pre-installed on iPhones and Android devices, making them an easy choice for users. These tech giants have seamless user interfaces that allow users to make payments with a single tap, leaving PayPal to compete for attention on non-Apple and non-Google platforms.

PayPal has been behind in optimizing its mobile checkout experience, a gap it aims to close with the rollout of initiatives like “Fastlane,” which simplifies checkout processes for merchants and customers . PayPal’s CEO Alex Chriss also mentioned improving the overall customer experience on mobile platforms as a top priority .

**4. Growth Rate and Historical Performance**

PayPal’s revenue per share and EPS have consistently grown over the past decade. The company’s revenue per share increased from $4.84 in 2012 to $29.09 in the trailing twelve months (TTM) of 2024, while EPS grew from $0.66 in 2012 to $4.16 in the same period . This strong growth highlights PayPal’s ability to scale, even in a competitive market.

**5. Cash Position**

As of Q2 2024, PayPal holds over $18 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments . This substantial cash reserve provides the company with a strong buffer to invest in strategic growth initiatives and return value to shareholders. The company has also returned $5 billion through share repurchases over the past year .

**6. P/FCF and P/E Ratios**

PayPal’s valuation metrics have seen notable declines in recent years. The P/FCF ratio dropped to 15.69 in 2023, with the P/E ratio falling to 15.99 in the same period . These valuations are considerably lower than PayPal’s historical averages, reflecting the market’s uncertainty about the company’s growth potential.

**7. Leadership Transition: Alex Chriss**

PayPal is under new leadership as of September 2023, with Alex Chriss stepping in as the new CEO. Chriss, formerly an executive at Intuit, brings extensive experience in global payments, product development, and technology. His appointment followed a thorough CEO search process by PayPal’s Board of Directors, who sought a leader capable of driving the company’s growth and transformation.

Chriss has a proven track record in leading small and mid-market businesses, having grown Intuit’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group customers by a 20% compound annual growth rate during his tenure. He was also responsible for leading Intuit’s $12 billion acquisition of Mailchimp, expanding its product offerings .

In his first year as CEO, Chriss has focused on transforming PayPal’s operations by driving innovation in mobile experiences, enhancing branded checkout services, and increasing customer engagement .

**8. Competition and PayPal’s Edge**

Despite Apple and Google dominating mobile payments, PayPal retains a competitive edge through its global two-sided network, which connects both merchants and consumers. PayPal’s massive network is hard to replicate, giving the company a strategic advantage as it continues to expand its services. Initiatives like Fastlane and Venmo’s increasing integration with merchants such as eBay and StubHub position PayPal to regain market share.

**9. Recommendation**

While PayPal faces significant competition, its current valuation presents an attractive buying opportunity. The company’s focus on improving mobile checkout experiences, coupled with its strong cash position and ongoing innovation, makes it a solid long-term investment. Investors should consider buying PayPal stock on dips as the company continues to execute its strategic initiatives under new leadership.

In conclusion, PayPal’s ability to navigate competitive pressures, enhance customer experiences, and drive profitability makes it a worthwhile investment for long-term growth.",2024-09-08,12,37

# What the Company Does

PayPal is a leading payment processor facilitating transactions for nearly 400 million consumer accounts and 35 million merchants in more than 200 markets around the world. PayPal primarily generates revenues by charging volume-based fees for completing transactions on behalf of their customers but also earns interest on consumer credit products and customer balances. The company processed 25 billion transactions worth $1.5 trillion in 2023, with 29% of this volume coming from PayPal’s legacy branded business, 35% from unbranded (i.e. not PayPal) card processing, 26% from peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and the balance coming from other merchant services and eBay.

# Why We Own It

PayPal is a high-quality business with a new management team, strong growth prospects and a compelling valuation. Alex Chriss started as CEO in September of 2023 and formerly led Intuit’s small business group, where he grew customers and revenues at annual rates of 20% and 23%, respectively. He is now taking the same customer-first approach to PayPal’s massive installed base in an effort to improve the customer experience and also reduce waste. New products like Fastlane improve the user checkout experience and purchase conversion, while unbranded efforts are also starting to see a profitability boost. P2P transaction app Venmo has significant growth potential too, with only 60 million users and incremental revenue potential from the Venmo debit card. The team is seeing early signs of success, causing the company to increase its guidance for full-year sales and earnings in the Q2 report on the heels of the highest transaction margin dollar growth rate in three years. At a macro level, the company’s ecommerce focus is desirable since roughly 20% of retail sales occur online currently; with the ecommerce market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% over the next four years to a nearly $8 trillion market by the end of 2027, PYPL can provide strong top-line growth simply by holding market share.

Despite the robust profitability, and many avenues for potential growth, shares currently trade at a forward (FY24) EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.8x, or a nearly 43% discount to peers (SQ, MA, V, FI, FIS, ADYEN NA, GPN).

# How Management Allocates Capital

With more cash than debt, a highly cash-generative business model, and an aligned management team, the company plans on spending all $6B of this year’s guided free cash flow to repurchase stock, or approximately 9% of the company at our entry valuation. Management should be able to use cost takeouts to fund strategic internal investments, which may serve as a modest short-term headwind for operating margins but will hopefully translate into strong top-line and bottom-line gains in the future.

Apple  is going to have to share some of its payment technology, regulators say, and that could mean big things for PayPal , according to one analyst team.



Thursday morning, Apple settled with European Union antitrust regulators by committing to open its near- field communication technology, which makes possible the tap-to-pay function, to third-party payment providers for free, according to a news release from the EU. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.



The settlement could offer “multiple benefits” for PayPal, Mizuho Securities analysts led by Dan Dolev wrote in a Thursday report. They rate PayPal shares at Outperform with a price target of $90.

Apple’s Tap to Cash Lets Users Pay By Touching iPhones

Apple’s new iPhone update will include a new way for users to transmit funds.

In addition to the various AI announcements the tech giant made at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) Monday (June 10), Apple also unveiled some updates to Apple Pay, including a feature called that will come with iOS18 dubbed “Tap to Cash.”

“Users get new ways to pay with Apple Pay, including the ability to redeem rewards and access installments from their eligible credit or debit cards,” the company’s announcement said.

“With Tap to Cash, users can send and receive Apple Cash by simply holding two iPhone devices together.”

Apple is also updating event tickets in the Apple Wallet, giving users more details about said events from participating ticket issuers, like information about the venue and recommended playlists from Apple Music.

The announcement comes at a time when — as noted here last week — digital wallets are growing in popularity.

Federal Reserve data shows that a stunning 84% of all payments made last year came from alternative, non-cash methods.

In addition, the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Digital Bill Payments: Mobile Wallets Gain Popularity, but Hurdles Remain” showed that 60% of consumers used mobile wallets to pay their bills in 2023, a 22% increase from the prior year.

And when it comes to digital wallet purchases by retail shoppers, Apple Pay has begun overtaking PayPal, according to additional PYMNTS Intelligence research, even before the introduction of the new “Tap to Cash” option. 

“The study found that, at the start of 2022, PayPal was retail customers’ digital wallet of choice, and it was not even close,” PYMNTS wrote last week. “However, in the time since, Apple Pay has taken the lead. The Apple-owned digital wallet briefly surpassed the former favorite online payments system in the first quarter of last year before falling behind again.”

But as of the first quarter of 2024, Apple was ahead, with that lead continuing to grow during the second quarter of the year. During that quarter, 12% of consumers had made their most recent retail purchase with a digital wallet, around 6% using Apple Pay, and 4% via PayPal.

And Apple is seeing this adoption rise.

“There are some categories that are growing very fast, … because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business, like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records,” Apple CFO Luca Maestri said during the company’s last earnings call.",2024-06-12,3,7

1cu9cb8_PYPL,PYPL,PayPal stock extremely undervalued ?,"
I believe paypal stock is extremely undervalued at its current price. Trading at just a 13-14 forward PE and a ~6% cash flow yield, $PYPL is essentially being priced for no future growth , and is well below the S&P 500 average.

Despite concerns of competition from Apple and Square, PayPal posted 9% revenue growth , 27% EPS growth and 76% free cash flow growth (Y/Y) in their most recent quarter. Additionally , they reiterated their stock buyback program of at least $5B. My basic thesis is that PayPal will experience accelerated EPS growth due to cost cutting measures and stock buybacks. Because PayPal is already trading so cheaply i believe the risk reward is very attractive.  

With such  respectable brand value , double digit EPS and cash flow growth , PayPal should be trading at a MINIMUM of a 20 fwd pe. A 20 PE would put the market cap at around $100B based on net income of $5B (projected for 2024 full year) ",2024-05-17,332,270

PayPal's growth story is showing a new trend: the number of people signing up for new accounts isn't going up much anymore, but the amount of money moving through PayPal is still on the rise. This is because the folks who already have PayPal are using it more often.

Venmo, which is part of PayPal and popular for sending cash to friends, isn't adding as many new users or seeing more money flow as it used to. So, it looks like PayPal might be hitting a high point for now, where just about everyone who might want an account already has one.

The challenge for PayPal will be to keep its current users interested and spending, while also trying to find new ways to grow. Whether this is just a short pause or a sign that they've reached their limit, we'll have to wait and see. But right now, PayPal's still a big name in how people send and spend money online.",2024-02-18,13,5

1ald2q8_PYPL,PYPL,PayPal (PYPL) Earnings Analysis,"For the next analysis we will be looking at Paypal Holdings Inc (NYSE: PYPL) earnings. Paypal was a revolutionary company that standardized online payments but has faced difficulties in recent years once several large players entered the market. The stock has faced nonstop pressures over the past 12 months and reached a 10 year low in October, but has since bounced +26.71%. In this report, analysts place the most value on Paypal reducing market share loss, along with the guidance heading into the rest of the year. Paypal will report earnings after the bell on February 7th with the earnings call to follow. All eyes will be on how the CEO (Alex Chriss) plans to save the company that many believe is a melting ice cube. With that being said, let’s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.


Description: 


Paypal Holdings Co (NYSE: PYPL) is a payment processing company that also owns Venmo, a popular P2P payment app focused in the United States. The company has faced nothing but pressure this year with increased competition and the process of changing management also impacting business strategy. Q4 will be the first good look into how CEO Alex Chriss operates, and by the looks of it cost cutting and making the company leaner will be at the top of his priorities. The introduction of Apple Pay and Google Pay have spelt disaster for Paypal, and analysts hope to see an updated combat plan from management to keep growing and expanding market share along with potential opportunities to expand the revenue streams within the company. Last week, management announced they would be laying off 9% of the workforce, which isn’t terribly surprising as over 100 technology companies have announced layoffs over the past several years to consolidate operations.


Financial Breakdown:


LTM Price Increase: $83.23 – $63.72 (-23.44%)
Users: Q3 2023 – 428MM | Q2 2023 – 431MM 
Revenue increase: +8% YoY Q3 and +1.7% Q2-Q3
Competitors: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Block (SQ)


Earnings:


Q3 Reported EPS: $1.30 (+5.78% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $7.42B (+0.47% delta)

Stock Move: Stock jumped +8.59% after earnings

Q4 Expected EPS: $1.36 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $7.87B


Verdict: 


With Paypal reporting earnings after market close on February 7th, it will be interesting to see how the new management has fared in the face of fierce competition. After months of bad news, analysts are hoping to see positive signs across the company. Looking at the performance of this stock, I can’t help but compare it to Boeing and Ford. All three of these companies were beat down and had poor expectations heading into earnings, and as expected any positive news resulted in a bounce. The largest difference here is that this is a technology company, so Snapchat could be a better comparison where underperformance spells disaster. Looking at the steps the company is taking, it seems like guidance will be positive with various cost saving measures implemented along with the introduction of efficiency increasing measures like AI. I think the largest challenge for this company will be beating lofty earnings expectations but if they can do that, I expect a massive bounce (~9%). It will be interesting to see how the company performs overseas, as there is plenty of opportunity in developing nations for services like Venmo. 


Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. As we head into the report, I am hoping to see a beat across the board with EPS and Revenue figures. Seeing as this is the managements’ first major test with a quarter under their belt, they cannot afford to perform poorly. I expect online payments to continue expanding, and therefore hope to see Paypal post positive growth from last quarter. The presence of ecommerce is a massive opportunity that I believe the company will be able to monetize and can see guidance being positive. Now, seeing as the risk for this report is off the charts, I am not loading up too heavily in either direction. I purchased 3 $64.00 calls expiring February 9th. The expected move for this stock is +/- 8.4% so the $64.00 calls offer ample profits IF AND ONLY IF the company can showcase improvements from last quarter. As of now, the company is viewed as a buy opportunity by most analysts due to its low P/E ratio, so a bounce could happen. Stock like this have incredible downward pressure and most expect it to decrease post earnings, but I am inversing the sentiment as I believe much of the trouble is priced in. But, the lofty Revenue and EPS figures certainly pose a challenge and could result in collapse of the stock.

That there is a secret financial company that Berkshire is accumulating in the second half of 2023 is NOT the speculation. That is a fact. From the article:

I can understand that competence in Paypal is greater than the one visa and Mastercard deal with in their business models, however, does that imply this valuation difference? 

  
To me, a PER lower than 15x is considered for companies that are industrials, ciclical... but I dont see Paypal growth comparable to that, 7-15% growth on revenues is not comparable to a revenue growth of 3-5% right? 

  
Also, I see it trading at 2017 values, while EPS is significantly higher, together with revenues.   
if it was trading at, lets say 25x PER Ratios, i could be a bit more worried about competition and revenues maybe going down, but at these prices, to me its a buy. 

  
Please see the PER historical chart, which shows that even 25x assumption is something that we havent seen for a while.

However, like most technology darlings during the pandemic, PYPL experienced accelerated growth in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The ""slow down"" appears to be a simple return to the mean. See what happened with Netflix when their user growth appeared to slow and then grew again in the following quarters. 

Despite these concerns about user growth, the fundamentals continue to perform well. Free cash flow growth is almost in the double digits along with revenue and net income. Total payment volume continues to accelerate and the balance sheet is solid. 

New management has stressed the importance of delivering value to shareholders through improved margins and stock buybacks. The new CEO comes from Intuit and you can see the value that was created there. 

The business model is also well diversified with a Stripe and Square competitor in the portfolio.

PayPal performance has been horrible in whatever chart we take a look at. YTD, monthly, 6 months...heck, it is trading equal or even lower to its share price back in 2017. What do you guys think about this stock? Is it a buy? Sell? 

&#x200B;

My thoughts 

\- Although competition is a concern, PayPal is still a solid brand name. Transactional volume still growing. 

\- The drop in user count YoY might not be a direct effect of increased competition, but pandemic online shopping has died down.

\- FCF is strong, buybacks & low forward PE.

\- Possible growth stories with Braintree, PayPal buy now pay later & Venmo.

\- New CEO focused on improving profit margins. 

\- High single digit growth

\-Decent network effects on both sides

So my question is… should I sell for a giant loss and buy google or nvidia? Google is more enticing because the growth is great, solid company and the PE seems to be in a good spot. nvidia is obviously a great company but I’m worried with the price and PE already being so high. Any recs?

With no CapEx/depreciation and very negligible change in NCWC (0.36% in 2022), I've just ignored these two in adjusting EBIT.

I assume that PYPL will struggle to get their margins up as their revenues shift to their other products of lower margin (e.g. Braintree) and also won't be seeing their revenues grow in double digits without some savvy acquistions and there are no obvious candidates.

12hevom_PYPL,PYPL,A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],"A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?

# Operations

First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.

* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts
* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion
* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.

The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.

# Competition

When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.

***US market***  
In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.

***Worldwide***  
In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.

***Total Payment Volume competition***  
Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.

# Financials metrics

We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?

To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.

Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:

* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%
* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%
* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%
* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%

Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.

# Analyst Expectations

Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:

* 18.33% in 2023
* 15.28% in 2024
* 13.07% in 2025

In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.

Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.

# Valuation

This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:

* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.
* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94
* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2
* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1
* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4

The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.

One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.

The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.

The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.

# Conclusion

Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

https://preview.redd.it/l6cxg36x0qz91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a5fa9ef395ee94087c8b1d7b63115158b8d

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",2022-11-13,245,55

Major U.S.-based payment processor PayPal has assembled a team of industry experts to act as advisors on crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies. 

In a Tuesday announcement, PayPal said the addition of six members to its Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies advisory council would help support its current and future products as well as its goal of creating a more inclusive digital financial ecosystem. Fortress Investment Group co-CEO Peter Briger, Georgetown University Law Center professor Chris Brummer, Weizmann Institute of Science professor Shafi Goldwasser, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Timothy Massad, MIT Sloan School of Management finance professor Antoinette Schoar, and MIT Digital Currency Initiative director Neha Narula will be joining the PayPal initiative.

“We believe it is crucial to engage with the world’s best leaders to better understand the industry’s most compelling opportunities and complex challenges,” said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal’s senior vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto, and digital currencies.

All six advisers carry years of experience from the crypto and blockchain space from a business or regulatory perspective. Briger was reportedly the one responsible for advising Softbank Group founder Masayoshi Son to invest millions in Bitcoin (BTC) prior to the 2017 bull run. Goldwasser was part of a group of MIT researchers who proposed zero-knowledge proof as an encryption scheme long before the advent of crypto.

During her time with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Narula has been in charge of an initiative to help the federal reserve bank of Boston build a digital currency aimed at scaling for consumer use. Brummer was reportedly a candidate for CFTC chair before President Joe Biden officially nominated Rostin Behnam. Massad, who served as CFTC chair from 2014 to 2017, argued after he left his position that regulators should approve an exchange-traded fund offering exposure to BTC.

Great company I say.

Guidance to double revenue by 2025 they say.

How foolish is the market for punishing this stock so much, I say.

So, I buy.

&#x200B;

Comes out today with a 50% decline in EPS year-over-year, and a 20% drop in EPS guidance for full-year 2022.

Fuck you PayPal, you fucking piece of shit company.

&#x200B;

For those of you that think that the price drop after-hours is an ""overreaction"".... Why?

I personally don't sell on rumours or herd mentality, but rather when there is a fundamental change in the company's milestones. Today, PayPal showed that it's failing to deliver. Massively.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: Having spent quite some time looking into today's Earnings, along with past releases, I'm beginning to think that the EPS decline is not as bad as it seems.

With any investment, Quarterly updates serve as a benchmark for you to decide whether there's fundamental shifts in the company's execution and/or strategy that could shift the **why** you invested in the first place.

The reality is that (see the latest Investor Update deck from PayPal's website) [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf)

(1) TPV and Revenue are (excluding eBay) expected to grow at roughly \~20% for FY22 (2022: TPV growing to $1.5T and revenue to exceed $29B)

(1i) Revenue growth includes an eBay decline of $600Mil, which is actually very impressive

(2) Free Cashflow is expected to grow by approximately \~11% for FY22 to $6Bil. This is similar but stronger guidance than the year before.

(3) FY-21 Venmo volume increased 44% to $230Bil

(4) Net income was impacted by:

(4i) Volume-based expenses grew 22.5% and non-transaction related expenses grew 10.4% ◦ Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.6% and technology and development increased 19.1%

&#x200B;

**Verdict**

After relevant research, I firmly believe that after a near 50% correction, a further 10-15% drop is indeed an overreaction to this news. There could be some more selling to follow, but I will personally be buying more.

The latest earnings highlighted some profitability concerns, but PayPal is in no way, shape or form a struggling company.

s3sqbk_PYPL,PYPL,PayPal (Ticker: PYPL) Investment Thesis," 1. Overview

PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal’s mission is to ‘*democratize financial services to improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world’*. Their goal is to enable merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid. PayPal also facilitates person-to-person (‘P2P’) payments through the PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services and simplifies and personalized shopping experiences for consumers through the Honey Platform. 

PayPal earns revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on their payments platform. PayPal generally does not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, they generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion and instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, as well as from interest and fees from their credit products. PayPal also earns revenue by providing other value added services, which comprise revenue earned through partnerships, merchant and consumer credit products, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that are provided to  merchants and consumers.

2. Customers

At the end of Q3 2021, PayPay had 416 million active accounts up 15% year-over-year (YoY) consisting of 383 million consumer active accounts and 33 million merchant active accounts. PayPal defines an active account as *‘an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform or through our Honey Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months’*.

For example, iPAY ETF is down 20% from the high it was staying at for an entire year.

I did a check on the IV and for PYPL the IV is 12% lower than the usual level. This means its not 50% which would be average for the year, its at 38% so if it does anything but stagnate the contracts will go up.

What's poppin' bull gang, hope you’re all doing well! We’ve got meme week ahead of us, meaning that we’re likely gonna see some fun price action combined with thousands of OTM calls getting turned to ash in an instant. Overall, I don’t see too many appealing plays this week, but I’ll still be sitting on the sidelines eagerly watching. Those who decide to trade this week are braver than I. Let’s get into it!

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **There aren’t many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isn’t any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, you’ll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. I’ll likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since it’s the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season, generating [back to back 30 baggers](https://imgur.com/a/v5NLArJ) just last week.

&nbsp;

- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since it’s inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesn’t indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning we’ve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so you’ve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.

&nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they’re buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn’t go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.

p9n21y_SNOW,SNOW,"I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): DKNG, SNOW, DPZ, PYPL, TSM","# Last Week’s Review

The SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week’s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.

Jackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what’s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I’ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.

&#x200B;

The market is in a peculiar place. We have:

* Retail sales lower than expected
* China retail sales lower than expected
* China stocks still in hot lava
* Fed saying it’s time to taper
* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory
* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad

&#x200B;

There is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.

&#x200B;

I want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It’s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.

&#x200B;

There will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we’ve been doing with out “Buy The Dip” charts. Next week I’ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I’ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.

&#x200B;

* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?
* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?
* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company’s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?
* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it’s still something I want to buy.

&#x200B;

These are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.

&#x200B;

What do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let’s buy the Fing dip.

&#x200B;

# The MEME List

**DraftKings (DKNG)**

https://preview.redd.it/8s5zajbrpzi71.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd20aed890bd535e8de05ed1fdd9dabd3cd27899

DKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.

There is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.

&#x200B;

**Snowflake (SNOW)**

https://preview.redd.it/yqpiwkyrpzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=566d8b20a657abf145c1b299142dfbb6fc1fca5d

The over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it’s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.

&#x200B;

# The BTFD List

**Paypal (PYPL)**

https://preview.redd.it/9y31ffispzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=7752d2fdaf2c6cb822a8b90a1684dddea361f93a

Paypal stock dropped recently on earnings after Ebay announced a transition to their own managed payments system. PYPL did post impressive earnings, but had soft guidance for Q4 and the stock tumbled.

Unlike meme stocks PYPL's trends have been steady and consistent. Looking at the chart it just recently dipped below the 50 EMA to potentially form a reversal (but not yet), and is sitting at the 100 EMA where I am looking for a bounce. Should we lose this level I might exit the position as the trend would be confirmed to the downside and potentially $240.

&#x200B;

**Dominoes Pizza (DPZ)**

https://preview.redd.it/oouz0k4tpzi71.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bf6d69ce71c1c22ac70f6683a482c4b0b41157

Led by international expansions and strong domestic growth Dominoes pizza has been one of the most out-performing stocks of 2021. Similar to PYPL above it has been on an extremely consistent uptrend. The recent 5% dip has given an entry point and IMO any dip to the 50 EMA can also provide an entry. The stock is also hitting some over-sold indicators which would agree with my bias.

&#x200B;

**Taiwan Semis Manufacturing (TSM)**

https://preview.redd.it/lv8267stpzi71.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=68bdfd8e676eef73ca3bb7b27f4d2387a1772736

The semi-shortage has been affecting many industries. With how cyclical production can be analysts are nervous about the over-production and over-supply that might eventually hit. However, I expect chip demand to remain robust for the foreseeable future. TSM was trading in a range for almost 6 months and oversold levels are starting to show, but IMO this is a value play. TSM trading at a much lower PE relative to their competitors of NVDA and AMD, and not getting much love. To be able to buy this name back at almost the same price as 9 months ago is a value entry.

&#x200B;

That’s the end of this week’s edition! Hope you all are able to take something away from it. For those that are interested in the memes I’ll be bringing some of those back as well. Hope you had a great weekend all and see you next week!",2021-08-22,64,21

I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. 

For example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions.

PayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. 

PayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square.

As an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook.

So there you have it. Think about getting some money on the Square train, as that shit might pop.

>[**PayPal**](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ) **acquired the 30% stake it doesn’t already own in China’s GoPay, formally known as Guofubao Information Technology Co., on Dec. 31, 2020**, according to shareholder data from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.  
>  
>**Financial details weren’t disclosed in the data. The stake purchase came a year after PayPal bought a 70% stake in GoPay for an undisclosed amount，then becoming the first foreign company licensed to provide online payment services in China.**  
>  
>PayPal declined to comment.  
>  
>**In taking full control of one of the smaller players in the world’s largest payment market, PayPal will compete with domestic payments giants Alipay, owned by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd, as China fully opens up its financial sector.**

>The stake purchase also comes amid Beijing’s antimonopoly campaign against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and other Internet companies.

kib6z0_PYPL,PYPL,Advice on PYPL (Unsure if I should close position),"I managed to get pretty lucky with some PYPL calls on the hopes that their exposure to bitcoin would help them break through the resistance at 230 in addition to a strong fundamental business.

The stock has been running ever since it broke through resistance, and if BTC continues to rise I still see the possibility of a longer run up.

JPMorgan’s new QuickAccept service lets businesses take card payments within minutes, either through a mobile app or a contactless card reader, and users will see sales hit their Chase accounts on the same day.

That fast funding is offered free, unlike competitors including Square, which typically take a day or more and charge a 1.5% fee to make instant transfers.

The bank designed its QuickAccept card reader, a hardware device that processes card payments via tap, dip or swipe, internally with the help of a team gained from its 2017 WePay acquisition.

JPMorgan will soon migrate “a large portion” of its more than three million small business customers to the new service, said Jen Roberts, CEO of the Chase business banking unit.

So share price was $82.16 last I checked which is still in the profit range though I'll be a loss if I want to close at open. If premarket price is below $82/share, I'll just buy shares to lock in the profits. I highly doubt this is going to go below $80 so assingment shouldn't be too bad.

In two days it will be the 25th of July. Why is that date important, you may ask? PayPal. Earnings. ""Okay okay u/Sparkswont, PayPal reports their EPS on Wednesday, but why do I give a shit?""

Venmo. In 2013, PayPal whipped their dick out and made one of the best purchases in the history of the company. For the cheap price of $800 million, PayPal acquired Venmo. Since then, Venmo has exponentially increased the amount of cash they process on a quarterly basis. Since I know most of you faggots can barely read, I've put together a visual for you:

https://i.imgur.com/9jDlR0L.png

As we all know, money isn't paper anymore, it's all 1s and 0s in a database. Only old man Buffet uses tangible money these days, the real money is in the arbitrary ""balances"" in all these fucking mobile cash apps. Trust me, the last time any of my friends paid me in cash was the stone age. It's all through Venmo.

""Okay sparkyboy, you're starting to make sense. But so what if Venmo is doing billions in transactions? They don't even monetize it.""

Wrong. Venmo takes 3% in fees for every credit card transaction. PayPal is raking in this free cash all because kids these days don't care that 3% of their fucking money is disappearing under their nose.

Now, all that is well and good, but let's look at some historical charts. PayPal is likely to report positive EPS, but we all know that doesn't mean shit (see $NFLX). Let's take a look at how $PYPL has reacted to earnings beats in the past.

&nbsp;

Date|EPS Forecast|Actual EPS|Stock Movement
:--|:--|:--|:--
04/25/2018|0.41|0.45|+4.05%
01/31/2018|0.38|0.4|-5.88%
10/19/2017|0.32|0.34|+9.09%
07/26/2017|0.33|0.36|+5.17%

&nbsp;

Of the last 4 ERs, $PYPL has rallied on 3 of them. Fuck me, that's some good odds. Clearly there was a bit of a sell off in January, but it's probably just because of how extra monotone Daniel Schulman's (CEO) voice was sounding that day on the earnings call (trust me, I just listened to it and nearly fell asleep). Maybe people passed out and their head accidentally landed on the sell button, who knows.

Anyways, there's a lot more DD I could do on this, but by now you're already buying $ROPE because of your $MU FDs, so all you need to know is **I am your hail mary.**

1. It’s has been and most likely will remain the most (or one of) used mobile wallet/online payment methods in the United States. I use it and literally everyone I know, except for my grandparents, also use it frequently. 
2. It’s international and constantly expanding into potential markets like India
3. It’s acquiring a lot of its competitors
4. It has beaten growth expectations ever since they split from eBay
5. It’s not a “winner-take-all” scenario with online/mobile payment methods. PayPal is not only the current leader but the most “agnostic”-meaning you don’t have to own an Apple/Android product or be a member of a certain bank/social media outlet to utilize their services.

Ideas:

1. Sell the Jan $77.50 call $2.20-2.30 and turn the trade into a free spread.

2. Sell the Jan $80 call $1.40-1.47 collecting half my initial investment and have a larger spread.

3. Sell the Dec $77.50 call $1.08-1.15 then Sell Jan $77.50 or $80 call for more premium.
