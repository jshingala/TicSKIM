1kbq03e_QCOM,QCOM,Qualcomm tops estimates for revenue and earnings as chip sales rise 22%,"Qualcomm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped Wall Street expectations as the company’s chip sales showed strong year-over-year growth.

Qualcomm shares fell in extended trading as the company’s revenue forecast for the current quarter was slightly lighter than expectations.

Here’s how the chipmaker did compared to Wall Street expectations, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share**: $2.85 adjusted vs. $2.82 expected
* **Revenue**: $10.84 adjusted vs. $10.66 billion expected

In the current quarter, Qualcomm said it expected $2.70 at the midpoint in adjusted earnings per share on $10.3 billion in revenue at the midpoint. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $2.67 in adjusted earnings on $10.35 billion in sales in the current quarter.

Net income during the quarter ending in March was $2.81 billion, or $2.52 per share, compared to $2.33 billion, or $2.06 per share, in the year-ago period. Qualcomm’s adjusted results include exclusions for acquisition-related charges, interest expenses, and share compensation.

Qualcomm’s most important business is selling chips such as modems and processors for smartphones, including high-end devices made by Samsung and Apple. Its overall handset chip sales increased 12% on an annual basis to $6.93 billion.

But under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has been working to sell more chips for cars, reported as its automotive business, and more chips for other gadgets such as Meta’s Quest virtual reality headsets, under its Internet of Things business. Growth in those categories signals how well the company is diversifying away from its core handset business, which expects to lose Apple as a customer in the coming years.

Qualcomm said that its automotive business grew a 59% on an annual basis, to $959 million in sales. Its internet of things business rose 27% to $1.58 billion in revenue.

All together, Qualcomm’s business selling chips, called QCT, rose 18% on an annual basis to $9.47 billion in revenue during the quarter.

Qualcomm’s other major division is QTL, which is a profitable division that collects licensing fees from technology that Qualcomm developed and patented. QTL revenue was flat year-over-year at $1.32 billion.

Qualcomm is exposed to tariffs, export controls and shifts in demand because it designs and ships physical hardware. Amon said in a statement that Qualcomm was navigating the “current macroeconomic and trade environment.”

The company said it spent $2.7 billion on capital return during the quarter, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $938 million in dividends.

1j0a5cf_QCOM,QCOM,"Qualcomm: FTC’s Case, 18% Stock Drop, and a Lawsuit — Did They Cross the Line?","Hey everyone, any $QCOM investors here? If you were around in 2017, you probably remember the controversy over Qualcomm’s alleged anticompetitive practices. If not, here’s a recap of what happened—and the latest update on the investor lawsuit.

Back in 2017,[ the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hit Qualcomm with a complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-charges-qualcomm-monopolizing-key-semiconductor-device-used-cell-phones), accusing the company of overcharging for licenses, refusing to sell chips to manufacturers that didn’t accept its terms, and offering Apple exclusive discounts in exchange for using its baseband processors. 

These practices raised serious concerns about Qualcomm’s market dominance and sparked widespread scrutiny from regulators and the media.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-01-17/qualcomm-faces-u-s-antitrust-case) and [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-17-ftc-sues-qualcomm.html) quickly picked up the story, highlighting how Qualcomm’s tactics violated its commitments to fair licensing and competitive business practices. 



Soon, $QCOM dropped more than 18%. And, just days later, investors filed a lawsuit.

https://preview.redd.it/sqfycn4sdwle1.png?width=2124&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6da28dc91c0299444392aeda11d299224a1f2f6

Now, [Qualcomm has agreed to settle $75M with investors](https://11thestate.com/cases/qualcomm-investor-settlement) over these claims. So, if you held $QCOM shares during this time, you may be eligible to file for compensation (they’re accepting late claims on this)

Anyways, was Qualcomm’s strategy just aggressive business, or did they cross a line here? And did anyone invest in $QCOM back then?

1imioyo_QCOM,QCOM,Qualcomm: A Value Play Poised for Robotics Chip Growth,"Qualcomm (QCOM) currently trades around **$171.36**, about **25% below its 52‑week high**, with a P/E ratio near **18**—figures that suggest the market may be underestimating its potential. While roughly 75% of its revenue still comes from mobile (of which still has room for strong growth), Qualcomm’s strong fundamentals and R&D prowess position it to diversify into high‑growth areas such as robotics chips.

**Why Robotics?**  
The robotics market is set for rapid expansion as automation increasingly penetrates manufacturing, logistics, and service industries. Robotics systems require efficient, low‑power, high‑performance chips for real‑time decision‑making at the edge—a niche where Qualcomm’s advanced semiconductor designs can excel. Its custom “Oryon” cores, featured in the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite, are engineered for superior performance and energy efficiency, making them a well‑suited leader for robotics applications.

**A Diversified Growth Story**  
Qualcomm’s Q1 performance was strong, with reported sales of **$11.67 billion** and adjusted profits of **$3.41 per share**. Such robust cash flow and a healthy dividend (2%) provide the capital needed to invest in emerging sectors. As Qualcomm works to expand beyond its core mobile market, success in capturing even a modest share of the robotics chip market could provide a significant new revenue stream and further reduce its dependency on smartphones.

**Value Investing Perspective**  
For value investors, Qualcomm’s current discount and strong balance sheet offer an attractive entry point. Its ongoing efforts in automotive, IoT, and now robotics chips underscore a strategic diversification that could unlock substantial long‑term growth. While execution in new markets always carries risks, Qualcomm’s technological expertise and track record suggest it’s well‑positioned to capture a slice of the developing robotics market.

# MicroStrategy Drops the ‘Micro,’ Doubles Down on Bitcoin

  
MicroStrategy is no more—meet *Strategy*. The company officially rebranded ahead of its Q4 earnings, shedding the “Micro” and leaning fully into its Bitcoin identity. CEO Phong Le called it a reflection of the company’s “strategic core,” but let’s not kid ourselves—Strategy isn’t just a software firm anymore. With 471,107 bitcoins now sitting on its balance sheet, worth about $46 billion, it’s more of a corporate crypto whale than anything else. And just in case the new name wasn’t enough of a signal, the company rolled out a fresh logo featuring a Bitcoin-inspired orange “B.” Subtle.

**Big Bitcoin Buys, Bigger Debt Load**  
  
Strategy hasn’t just been HODLing—it’s been aggressively adding to its pile. Over the last quarter, the company scooped up 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, burning through debt and stock sales like an overleveraged crypto trader. That’s part of a larger plan to raise $42 billion in capital over three years, and so far, it’s already hit the halfway mark, well ahead of schedule. Investors are torn—some see it as a masterstroke in capital allocation, while others worry that tying a public company’s fate so closely to Bitcoin’s volatility is a ticking time bomb.

**Earnings? Oh Right, Those Exist**  
  
While Bitcoin continues to dominate Strategy’s story, the company did technically report earnings. It posted a brutal $670.8 million loss, largely due to a $1 billion write-down on its crypto holdings, thanks to outdated accounting rules that don’t let companies mark digital assets up, only down. Revenue also dipped 3% year-over-year to $120.7 million, missing estimates. But starting this quarter, new accounting rules will let firms report Bitcoin at fair value, which could make Strategy’s books look a lot less painful going forward.

**What’s Next?** The rebrand cements what everyone already knew—this company isn’t about software anymore. With its eyes locked on Bitcoin and an aggressive capital-raising strategy in full swing, Strategy is doubling down on its crypto-fueled vision.

# Earnings Galore From Qualcomm, Uber, Disney, Novo Nordisk & Arm Holdings

**Qualcomm Drops 4% as Smartphone Market Outlook Disappoints**  
Qualcomm fell 4.58% in extended trading after the chip giant’s Q1 earnings revealed a shaky outlook for smartphone demand. While the company posted a revenue beat—$11.7 billion versus the expected $10.9 billion—investors focused on its forecast of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion for Q2, which was lower than some analysts had hoped. Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, a key indicator of phone sales, also came in below projections, fueling concerns that smartphone shipments will stagnate in 2025.

**Uber Tumbles 7.56% on Weak Bookings Forecast**  
Uber’s stock took a 7.56% hit after issuing a lackluster Q1 gross bookings forecast of $42 billion to $43.5 billion, falling short of prior estimates. The ride-hailing giant cited currency headwinds, legal expenses, and bad weather as key drags on its outlook. This overshadowed its otherwise strong Q4, where bookings grew 18% to $44.2 billion. Investors are now questioning whether Uber is simply setting a low bar to beat or if rising insurance costs and regulatory pressures will continue to weigh on its growth.

**Disney Slips 2.44% Despite Beating Expectations**  
Disney beat earnings estimates with EPS of $1.76, well ahead of the expected $1.42, and revenue rising 5% to $24.7 billion. Streaming was the bright spot, with Disney+ and Hulu generating $293 million in profit after price hikes. But investors fixated on a slight decline in Disney+ subscribers and warnings of another drop next quarter, dragging the stock down 2.44%. CEO Bob Iger assured investors that streaming margins would keep improving, but the market wasn’t fully convinced.

**Novo Nordisk Jumps 3.76% as Ozempic Demand Surges**  
Novo Nordisk surged 4.54% after forecasting 16%-24% revenue growth for 2025, fueled by skyrocketing demand for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company expects some supply constraints to persist, it reassured investors that production will ramp up. The strong outlook helped calm fears about increasing competition from Eli Lilly, whose weight-loss drug Zepbound had triggered concerns about market share erosion.

**Arm Holdings Sinks 6.82% on Muted AI Forecast**  
Arm Holdings slid 6.82% after issuing a cautious revenue forecast of $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion for Q1, disappointing investors hoping for stronger AI-fueled growth. The outlook followed a weak report from AMD earlier this week, sparking fears that the AI boom may not be as explosive as expected. Despite beating Q4 estimates—revenue jumped 19% to $983 million—investors weren’t thrilled with the chip designer’s conservative stance on AI-driven demand.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The labor market check-in continues tomorrow with the latest jobless claims report. Last week, new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to 207,000, beating forecasts of 220,000—another sign of a resilient job market. But ongoing claims, which track those still looking for work, have been creeping up, and economists are watching closely for any cracks in hiring trends.

On the earnings front, it’s a packed day with updates from Eli Lilly ($LLY), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY), AstraZeneca ($AZN), Kellanova ($K), Yum Brands ($YUM), Cloudflare ($NET), Roblox ($RBLX), Under Armour ($UA), Pinterest ($PINS), Affirm ($AFRM), Honeywell ($HON), Peloton ($PTON), Hershey ($HSY), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), and Skechers ($SKX).

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** has mastered the art of blending gaming and social media, making it a favorite among the middle school elite. The platform has nailed monetization while keeping safety a priority, fueling a stock surge over the past year. But with its valuation climbing, some investors may hesitate—though Wall Street sees plenty of room for growth if it continues dominating the digital playground. Consensus: -$0.45 EPS, $1.37 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Amazon** faces challenges from all angles—AI could shake up its cloud empire, and tariffs might dent its e-commerce machine. But size matters, and Amazon’s scale gives it a serious edge. With a booming ad business, top-tier margins, and industry-leading efficiency, it’s no surprise that nearly every analyst calls it a buy. Consensus: $1.49 EPS, $187.25 billion in revenue.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

# Tomorrow

No major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.

Bowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.

Though she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Target** may be a household favorite, but even fan favorites feel the squeeze. Earlier this year, the retailer slashed prices on thousands of products to entice budget-conscious shoppers—and they’re gearing up to do it again for the holiday season. Despite the markdown marathon, Target’s bottom line has stayed relatively steady, and analysts expect the previous quarter to hold up well. Still, shareholders are likely asking the big question: When does the discounting spree end? For now, the consensus calls for $2.30 EPS on $25.96 billion in revenue. ($TGT)

# After Market Close: 

* **Nvidia** continues to play the MVP role in the stock market. Its Magnificent 7 counterparts delivered solid earnings this quarter, and all eyes are on whether the chip titan—up nearly 190% this year—has more fuel in the tank. For those fearing they’re late to the AI boom, analysts are betting there’s plenty of runway left. With AI demand showing no signs of cooling, Nvidia remains the undisputed king of the semiconductor hill. Consensus estimates peg earnings at $0.74 per share on $32.86 billion in revenue. ($NVDA)",2024-11-19,1,2
1gp088h_QCOM,QCOM,Why is QCOM still stuck at ~$165? It's a high-growth chip stock at a fwd P/E of 15!,,2024-11-11,16,36
1gp088h_AMD,AMD,Why is QCOM still stuck at ~$165? It's a high-growth chip stock at a fwd P/E of 15!,"The market seems to really hate QCOM. It's one of the very few AI or semiconductor stocks that aren't priced in the stratosphere.

Here is a summary for those not familiar:  
Qualcomm specializes in the design and development of wireless telecommunications products and services. They are a major player in the development of 5G and are best known for their Snapdragon processors, which power a vast majority of smartphones worldwide, and their modem chips (supplied to Apple until at least 2026). Additionally, Qualcomm owns many fundamental patents for smartphone and wireless technology, issuing a nice \~2% dividend fully funded with licensing fees.

The last ER on November 6th was a blockbuster, with a strong EPS and revenue beat, 68% YoY growth in automotive, 24% quarterly growth in IoT, strong FCF, and raised guidance. The stock popped 10% after hours; however, by close, it was trading slightly lower than before the ER!

The only significant risk is their upcoming lawsuit with ARM on December 16. There are some nuclear options that ARM can push for (terminating the license and stopping the shipment of QCOM chips with ARM IP), but the most likely outcome is a new out-of-court agreement giving a bit more money to ARM. There is no way this would cut QCOM's EPS in half, which is what the current P/E seems to be pricing in.

And yet, QCOM has been stuck between $155 and $175 since August despite the recent market rally. Yes, they have significant business in China, but so is any other semiconductor company. The management is pursuing diversification and collaborations with big tech to push AI on the edge. New Snapdragon chips for laptops had good reviews, especially for a first-generation product. MSFT seems committed to the Copilot+ PCs, putting billions in software and marketing that directly benefit QCOM. Any ideas what's going on?",2024-11-11,19,36

1glceac_QCOM,QCOM,Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

# Tesla Notches a Blowout Quarter on Strong Sales, Credits

Tesla is back in the fast lane. 

The EV giant reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, clocking in at 72 cents per share and ending a four-quarter losing streak. 

Demand for Tesla’s cars rebounded in a big way, with CEO Elon Musk forecasting a potential 20-30% growth in deliveries next year. Shares surged 12% in late trading, marking a sharp turnaround for the stock, which had been down 14% this year.

Tesla’s quarterly win wasn’t just about sales, though. The company raked in $739 million from regulatory credits—selling them to carmakers who need help meeting emissions targets. It’s clear that Tesla’s profits are being boosted not only by the cars on the road but also by the deals happening behind the scenes.

**Driving Growth with New Models and Margins**  
Musk’s big plans don’t stop there. Tesla reiterated its commitment to rolling out more affordable models by 2025, while its futuristic Cybertruck is finally profitable after a production ramp-up. And there’s more good news: Tesla’s gross margin (excluding credits) jumped to 17.1% from 14.6% last quarter.

The company is also steering full throttle into autonomous driving. Musk teased a robotaxi service, set to launch in Texas and California next year. If the tech holds up (and regulators play ball), this could be a game-changer for Tesla’s future business model.

**What’s Next?**  
While Tesla’s recent results are impressive, challenges lie ahead. T

he company faces stiff competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, along with legacy brands such as Ford and GM stepping up their EV game. Tesla also needs a strong Q4 to top last year’s deliveries, and heavy price cuts could keep pressuring its margins.

Still, with its sights set on affordable models and a driverless future, Tesla seems ready to ride out the storm. Investors are watching closely to see if this momentum can carry the stock even higher.

# Arm to Scrap Qualcomm Chip Design License, Feud Escalates

Arm just threw a major curveball at Qualcomm. 

The UK-based chip designer is pulling the plug on a key license agreement, giving Qualcomm 60 days to fix their messy legal spat or risk losing access to critical tech. 

Qualcomm, known for powering most Android smartphones, might be forced to stop selling its flagship processors if it can’t resolve the issue.

This isn’t just a minor tiff—both companies took a hit. Arm’s shares dropped 6.67%, and Qualcomm’s fell 3.8% as the markets weighed the potential fallout of this escalating feud. If the license gets scrapped, Qualcomm’s $39 billion chip business could be on the chopping block.

**Why the Beef?**  
The bad blood dates back to 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm for breach of contract over its acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-design startup. 

Qualcomm says the lawsuit is just Arm trying to strong-arm (pun intended) them into paying higher royalties. Now, Arm’s stepping things up by threatening to cancel Qualcomm’s rights to use its chip architecture.

Qualcomm has big plans for Nuvia’s tech—its AI-driven PC processors are already hitting the market. If Arm’s move sticks, Qualcomm may need to scrap Nuvia’s designs entirely, a costly setback that could give competitors a golden opportunity.

**What’s Next?**  
With a December trial looming, many see Arm’s license termination as a bargaining chip to gain leverage. 

Qualcomm, however, is no stranger to courtroom drama, having settled disputes with Apple and Nokia in the past. A settlement seems likely, but if not, both companies could face serious damage.

Buckle up, because tomorrow's reports might actually stir the pot. First up, initial jobless claims—one of the Fed's favorite labor market indicators—dropped by 19,000 last week to 241,000. This week? Economists expect a small bump to 245,000, but that’s likely just seasonal noise.

Also on the radar: new home sales for September, with hopes of a slight rise from 716,000 to 720,000, and the S&P’s Purchasing Manager Index for services and manufacturing. Let's see if these numbers bring some real movement.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

For newbies, back in 2017, Qualcomm was accused of anti-competitive practices and only targeting big companies like Apple, offering them reduced fees. When this news came out, investors sued them for the stock drop caused by this.



But the good news now is that they agreed to pay $75M to investors to solve this huge mess. The deadline is in three weeks, so if you got hit back then, you can [check here](https://11thestate.com/cases/qualcomm-investor-settlement) if you are eligible and file for the payment.



In other news, apparently, Qualcomm hasn’t given up on acquiring Intel, it is just waiting for the US election results and the future antitrust landscape (and the international relationship between the US and China). So, we’ll see how things go.



Anyways, do you think Qualcomm will finally make an offer to buy Intel? And has anyone here had $QCOM when this anti-competitive scandal happened? If so, how much were your losses?

# Microsoft Powers Up AI With a Nuclear Comeback at Three Mile Island

Well, this is one headline we didn’t see coming. Microsoft is so hungry for energy to fuel its AI ambitions, it’s partnering with Constellation Energy to bring back the Three Mile Island nuclear plant — yes, the site of the *worst nuclear accident* in U.S. history. Constellation plans to invest $1.6 billion to reboot the plant’s Unit 1 reactor by 2028, and Microsoft has signed a 20-year deal to buy every watt of power it churns out. Looks like AI isn't just demanding your data — it needs a *whole lot* of juice too.

**What's the Deal?** Constellation, the U.S.'s biggest nuclear operator, plans to turn the once-shuttered Three Mile Island reactor into the Crane Clean Energy Center (a posthumous nod to former Exelon CEO Chris Crane). This marks a major milestone for both companies: Microsoft locks in a reliable, carbon-free energy source to fuel its AI data centers, while Constellation revives an aging reactor that couldn't compete with cheap natural gas and renewables. With AI's skyrocketing power demands, tech giants are scrambling for steady, green electricity.

**A Nuclear Renaissance:** This move taps into a broader trend: nuclear energy's comeback. After a wave of plant closures over the past decade, power-hungry industries like AI and EVs are driving renewed interest in these reactors. Nuclear plants, unlike wind and solar, run 24/7 — perfect for data centers that never sleep. Other tech giants like Amazon and Oracle are also turning to nuclear to keep up with their massive energy needs.

**But It’s Not All Glowing...**  Rebooting a reactor isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. The plant needs major upgrades to its cooling system, turbine, and transformer, and still faces a long queue for grid connection approval from PJM Interconnection, the local grid operator. Plus, it’s got to pass stringent safety checks from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If everything goes smoothly (fingers crossed), Three Mile Island could be back online as soon as 2027.

**Looking Ahead:** AI is reshaping the world — and the energy grid along with it. As data centers keep popping up and consuming ever more electricity, the demand for clean, continuous power will only increase. Whether this sparks a true nuclear revival or just a few isolated reboots remains to be seen, but one thing’s clear: Microsoft is betting on nuclear to fuel its AI-driven future.

Brace yourselves, we might just be entering the **AI-powered nuclear age**.

# Qualcomm Wants to Buy Intel

Things are heating up in Silicon Valley! Qualcomm, best known for its mobile chip domination, is reportedly eyeing Intelfor a possible takeover, according to insiders. If successful, this would not only be one of the largest tech deals ever but could also mark a major shift in the semiconductor industry. Intel, once the top dog, has been *sputtering* with a steep 60% stock drop this year, while Qualcomm is ready to make moves.

**The Plot Thickens:** Intel’s got a lot on its plate – a major $1.6 billion loss this past quarter, layoffs, and restructuring, all while its market value plummeted from $290 billion in 2020 to around $90 billion. Talk about a fall from grace! Despite its struggles, Qualcomm sees a potential golden ticket in Intel's PC and server chip dominance, which could complement its own strength in smartphone chips.

But don’t start popping the champagne yet—this deal is far from certain. There’s always a little thing called antitrust scrutiny that could trip things up. Plus, Qualcomm might have to offload parts of Intel to make it work. Hey, no one said buying a $90 billion company would be easy.

**Why Intel?** For decades, Intel reigned supreme as the largest semiconductor company, but the rise of rivals like AMD, Broadcom, and NVIDIA has left the company in a tough spot. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has been on a three-year turnaround mission, but things haven’t exactly gone according to plan. Their recent efforts include trying to spin off their manufacturing business and landing a deal with Amazon for custom AI semiconductors. Still, Intel is struggling to regain its footing.

On the other side, Qualcomm has been expanding beyond smartphones, recently re-entering the desktop processormarket, especially with AI integration. This could make Intel's x86 chips an ideal addition to Qualcomm's arsenal.

# Looking Ahead

If this deal goes through, it could shake up the global chip game. Qualcomm might finally get the manufacturing muscleit’s been outsourcing, but it’s a risky bet. Intel’s manufacturing issues are notorious, and fixing them is no small task. Plus, the deal would set the stage for a massive showdown between Qualcomm’s ARM chips and Intel’s x86 architecture—a battle that could reshape the industry.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Now that the Fed has wrapped things up, we can focus on what’s coming next week—and it’s packed.

Monday serves up the latest manufacturing and services PMI numbers, Tuesday brings the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, and Wednesday is all about new home sales. On Thursday, it’s jobless claims and pending home sales.

Friday closes out with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s go-to for inflation. While it’s lost a bit of its punch lately as the Fed shifts focus to the labor market, Powell and Co. are still keeping tabs on it.

The company's $9.39 billion in revenue, an 11.1% year-over-year increase, demonstrated robust demand for its products, which are crucial in 5G, IoT, autonomous driving, and AI-driven data center applications.

The adjusted operating income of $3.02 billion, a 2.2% beat, highlighted Qualcomm's efficiency in navigating the cyclical semiconductor landscape. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose to $2.33, a 3.3% improvement over the same quarter last year, reflecting the company's strong financial performance.

Qualcomm's optimism for the future is evident in its Q3 guidance, with revenue projected at $9.9 billion, a 2% increase above analyst estimates. 

Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the quarter stands at $2.55, also above market expectations. These figures indicate that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on ongoing technological advancements.

The inventory management picture was mixed, with Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) at 131 days, which is higher than the five-year average by 26 days. While this suggests a temporary increase in inventory, it could be an indication of a potential tightening in supply or heightened demand, depending on the company's strategic planning. 

A decline in DIO from the previous quarter implies that Qualcomm is taking steps to manage its inventory more efficiently.

The stock market responded positively to the earnings report, with Qualcomm's shares trading up 6.3% to $192.17 post-release. This rally underscores investor confidence in the company's growth prospects, particularly as it continues to navigate the opportunities in the 5G and AI-driven tech sectors.

As a fabless manufacturer, Qualcomm's long-term success is tied to broader tech trends and consumer demand. With a market capitalization of $186.3 billion, the company is well-equipped to leverage its innovation and maintain its position at the forefront of wireless technology. 

However, investors should remain aware that semiconductor cycles can be cyclical, and periods of growth may be followed by contractions, offering potential entry points for long-term investors.",2024-08-01,9,4
1egx51l_QCOM,QCOM,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.” The line also includes revenues from the company’s new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.

CEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a “milestone” in Qualcomm’s efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.

Those three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the company’s chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.

Qualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.

Qualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.

Intel is trading at 31$ with a P/E ratio of 32. They have Net debt of 32B vs Total debt of 52B last quarter. Net debt increased by 25% since last 6 months. They are cash flow negative from last two quarters, and a dividend yield of 1.61% based on TTM, while it was 1.47% in 2023FY.

Intel revenue is dependent on US and China Markets with 55% revenue contribution Combned iwhile Qualcomm is alone 62% China and Us is inly 3.5%.

1cwmjsx_QCOM,QCOM,Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm ,"Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.

The company on Monday announced Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft’s Copilot AI chatbot.

The computers adhere to Microsoft’s new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about what’s on screen.

Copilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.

A Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.

Microsoft is banking on Qualcomm’s energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.

Microsoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.

Other large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT’s underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.

The GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft’s Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company’s earnings call that “in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.”

Microsoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which haven’t always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.

Running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.

Analysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.

167b10w_GOOGL,GOOGL,"$BRQS is treated as scam but it has several valuable products and deals with famous companies like qualcomm, google and samsung.","Brqs or borqs tech is a Chinese company that manufactures and sells IOT products mainly in the United States, India, China and the rest of the world.

• It increased revenues by 77% in 2022, it is about to sell its sister company HHE (holo hou energy), an emerging energy company, solar panels and nuggets of $500 million with more than $100 million signed in March 2023.

•It is active in partnership with skycentrics, a Californian company that offers a product that should become in great demand. the CTA-2045 product has received permits and certifications + patents for sale which will start very soon.

• BRQS tech also won multiple projects for India and Taiwan IOT solution designs for smartphones, computers and other 5G devices.
In 2022 the Indian 2/3 wheel dashboard market opened, in 2023 in Taiwan.

Now let me talk about the negatives of this company.
First of all it is Chinese, as such it has a low valuation like all Chinese companies listed in the American markets.

This company to buy HHE in 2021 spent 10 million cash + raised funds for 16 million in Australia + diluted more than 50/60 million shares (15 million immediately in 2021 at a price of 5/7 $).
This dilution and debt have slaughtered shareholder value.
Prices have dropped 90% in one year and a whopping 99% in 3 years.

Accounts payable $35 million with negative interest + costs for the aforementioned skycentrics project.

shares outstanding which concretely penalized all the shareholders. 10/15 million cash, high debts, huge costs to stimulate growth of HHE and skycentrics projects + costs for IOT raw materials.


borqs tech's goal is to sell HHE for more than $100 million, in my opinion the numbers could be $200/250 million (we are talking about a sale by the end of 2023), share repurchase and/ o special dividend to shareholders.
As I wrote above borqs tech has debt of 35 million with negative interest.
It is important that the sale of HHE exceeds $200 million in order to pay off debt, finance a new project and deliver shareholder value.

“Once we receive the funds from selling our interest in HHE, Borqs will continue to invest into futuristic technologies, especially in artificial intelligence based IoT products,” said Mr. Pat Chan, CEO of Borqs. “We will also consider a share buyback program and/or a special dividend payout depending on the amount of cash to be received in order to enhance our shareholder value. We will provide further updates to our shareholders with regards to the HHE divestment during the next few months.”

• skycentrics cta2045 really seems a quality product, both companies have anticipated that the product has been in demand, the numbers will be evaluated in 6/12 months.

• borqs tech has an agreement with qualcomm, samsung and google to sell android iot products in india and other markets.

PERSONAL OPINION.

the stock market has rightly penalized a company that has heavily diluted the shares to cover debts and various costs but borqs tech is a serious company active in various international markets with real products and with great attention to growth.

•HHE, for example, is a successful company that has achieved incredible goals with borsq tech. PIPELINE went from $120 million in 2021 to $500+ million in 2023 with the California market just hitting late 2022.
• skycentrics promises well, a company with 5 million revenues which with borqs tech could reach at least 7/8 million in 2023.

• borqs tech built a 5g tower in china, in one of the most technological areas. Project value $15-20 million with construction in 2024 for 5G services.

• growth of the Indian and Taiwanese markets thanks to IOT products (India's fastest growing market by size).

today a share is worth only $0.15 or a $24 million market cap with 55 million in revenue AND $15 million in cash. HHE sale alone could change brqs valuations positive for shareholders.

The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear APPL bid to invalidate two QCOM patents given the past global settlement between the two companies.

qmp6ko_QCOM,QCOM,"$QCOM, option spread, and price action","Hi ya'll, 

Thought this might recap might provide some value (specifically to new traders or traders interested in options).

Traded $QCOM today for a decent winner, followed my plan entirely, and avoided some very bad setups (IMO). 

First, my watchlist was $GOOGL, $SQ, $TSLA, $QCOM, $MRNA. 

$GOOGL was a deal catalyst, I thought we might have a break of the highs. $SQ was another deal catalyst but its PM action was not desirable, $TSLA was of interest but it did NOT have enough volume for my strategy and was quite choppy the first minutes, $QCOM, and $MRNA were the ones I was really looking at. 

&#x200B;

[$TSLA chop, avoid!](https://preview.redd.it/l6v1p6p1zlx71.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14ab2bf1493288d80822906f53f8b460aa1ac8c)

At the open I was watching $MRNA, the stock had a beautiful breakdown but before taking the trade I double checked the spread, and the contracts were a little bit spread for my liking. Spread is important because you generally buy contracts at the ask, $GOOGL was another more extreme example of high spread. There is almost a 100 dollar difference between ask and bid, with my given stop (considering its delta) I would be WAY over my max loss amount for the DAY, so I avoided the trade.  This was too much risk so I decided to look at $QCOM, less spread for sure (give or take.15 or .20 spread at worst meaning I'm within my risk.. btw .01 equals 1 dollar for options).

&#x200B;

[$GOOGL spread, avoid!](https://preview.redd.it/09y87109zlx71.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cfa68bb07439f3de5fe03644720e6f3af760a69)

 $QCOM sold off a bit at the open and I missed the move down, saw it reclaimed the 9-ema, and waited for a break of VWAP. Thought we might retest the high and we did. 

$QCOM entry was around 9.45 or the break of the vwap and 9-ema. 

&#x200B;

[$QCOM one minute](https://preview.redd.it/86cl5q070mx71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=b068659ef008586f36eb9f70016ac0d4cb8c6747)

Took profits when it approached the highs, good timing considering my computer froze right after this (I have an old MSI I need to replace soon).

q7on6f_GOOGL,GOOGL,$BB - Y'all don't talk enough about Blackberry here. Google + Qualcomm partnership is huge.,"As you know, BB moved up 5% (50 cents) today on news that they have partnered with Google and Qualcomm. You're probably surprised it went up because it always goes down on news.

This news is different. This news is huge.

Everyone was quick to jump to the conclusion that Ford had dropped BB entirely from their cars in favour of Google: [https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)

Well, the Google and Qualcomm news pretty much puts that assumption to bed. Not only will BB still be in Ford cars, any car that is built using both Android's infotainment and Qualcomm's chips, will need BB tech.

We have Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Baidu, etc. etc. on our side. We have a patent sale that could be worth 1 billion+ coming no longer than 2 months from now. And we have Blackberry IVY slated to release this month.

Please stop throwing current revenue numbers at me when this thing is going to pump revenue out like crazy in the future. Stop focusing so much on their past. Stop focusing on how paperhands rule this stock. I don't see a company out there that has this many positive things going for it with a 5 billion dollar market cap.

If the stock market is forward thinking, why not BB?

**Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.**

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *–  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication —  not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology:

*TheStreet  Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares.

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered  the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.

**6. Piotroski F-Score**

The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.

**7. Moody’s Daily Credit Risk**

Moody’s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.

**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:

*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*

*A  low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.

Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.

The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.

""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.

Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.

In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.

Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.

Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.

""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said.

Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.

The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.

But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.

This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready.

""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

**Global Chip War**

	The U.S heavily relies on Asia to produce chips. This is a major issue because instead of building the infrastructure to produce our own chips, we end up spending billions on foreign products. To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

**Management**

	New CEO Cristiano Amon has worked at Qualcomm since 1995. Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of Vésper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. 

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

	We've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry.

I dont own Tesla but I know they got up to 880us in january 2021 but then dropped in march at around 600$ and now are 675us. 

So now here I am thinking, should i sell most of my qcom and buy a couple of tesla? 
I have a feeling tesla will go back up a lot again and in a shorter time. Qcom on the other hand im not so sure, i feel some phone companies are planing on doing theyre own 5g, also a shortage on 5g card wich will slow down the rise of their stocks.

They continue to have a strong market in phones, and per the news today are now trying to move beyond that into fixed wireless gear to replace (substandard) wired broadband, and using their newest chip (peak down of 10Gb/s) to connect scattered commercial and business equipment. 

I like that they're trying to expand into the commercial heavy-duty IoT market, that their new chip makes cord-cutting more viable, that they will be having an ambitious new CEO, and that they are part of the American 6G alliance. I think that they are the bread and butter stock that will make all the sexy cloud computing stocks work in real life, in many applications. The fall on expectations of short-term capacity limitations seems like overkill, for all that they are not an ""Apple go up"" stock. So many stocks with good outlooks have dropped after earnings this season (look at CRSR now!) - QCOM's unexpectedly big drop makes it temporarily better value.

Any opinions on this, and on the news today? The timing certainly seems a bit forced, and I can't tell if it is unlucky timing or aimed to combat the negative news.

Beyond the settlement, it looks like QCOM is now open to supply chips to Huawei for their phones which opens up huge revenue opportunities.

Also, (I know seeking alpha is a speculative website...) there is good evidence that QCOM is a leader in 5G chips for mobile:

https://seeking alpha.com/article/4364578-doubling-down-on-qualcomm

QCOM is trading at $110 today after reporting great earnings last week. Their PE ratio looks high at 36 currently ($113 share price / 3.55 [2019 Annual EPS]) = 31.83. TDA has them at a PE of 41 but I don't know how they're doing their math.

The settlement will add $0.75 to annual EPS as paid out over multiple years. In addition to added markets, this may finally be a chance for QCOM to take off.

If the projections are true, the forward PE ratio of QCOM moves from around 31 to 19, as the price increase hasn't been factored in yet to accommodate the EPS projections.

1. QCOM recently made new highs for the first time in abut 20 years.
2. The stock broke out of a long-term ascending triangle to make the new highs.
3. Although the stock was in a long-term uptrend the last 20 years, the stock has underperformed the broader stock market since 2009.
4. QCOM may be a better trading stock, rather than a buy-and-hold long-term stock.
5. Our current recommendation is to BUY QCOM for a short to medium-term trade, that has potential to become a long-term trade if it can show potential outperformance.

Look at their P/E when compared to other semiconductors. Antitrust rulings in effect in Europe. IV still low but there seems to be a consensus up of 0.1% with possibility as high as +/- 4%. Apple bought Intel. Their competition is skyrocketing. Apple reported lower iPhone sales which is also Qcom's revenue partner.

I don't own shorts for this because I am out of capital but if it works out for yall, please share some tendies ?

Instead, Apple will pay Qualcomm in addition to signing a six-year license agreement, effective as of Apr. 1, 2019. The companies have an option to extend the deal for another two years. Qualcomm [disclosed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-semiconductor-stocks-buy-spring-152914795.html#) that the deal will add $2 in incremental EPS.

Even though QCOM shares rose 40% on the week, the company’s fair value rises sharply thanks to the deal with Apple. At a recent price of $79, the stock is trading at a discount because the company could win more supply deals with the top Android phone makers. Competitors cannot afford to let Apple have the best technology and could order Qualcomm’s latest chip solutions to stay ahead.

In the near-term, QCOM stockholders get two immediate positive catalysts. First, uncertainties are no longer an overhanging to the stock because Qualcomm no longer needs to keep going to court. Second, Qualcomm has guaranteed a revenue stream for the next six years. That stability is worth paying for, especially in the cyclical semiconductor market.""

be0glg_QCOM,QCOM,"QCOM Vs. AAPL settlement. How I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 on a very stupid decision","Hello Everyone,

&#x200B;

I just needed a place to vent, because I just made the most stupid decision in my life, and I can't really justify it to myself or anyone that I know.

&#x200B;

Back in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.

&#x200B;

I bought 75 April 18 call options with a strike price of 65 for $0.10 each, and till yesterday night I was still holding them.

&#x200B;

I live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.

&#x200B;

I wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better. I got everything right but screwed up at the last minute. I feel so angry with myself and having a mental breakdown, and I needed to let someone know what happened.

&#x200B;

How do I live myself and go on with my life after that?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of those who offered support and understanding of the situation. I truly understand my mistake, and I know I failed because I never really had a risk and an action plan. It was never about trading for me.

&#x200B;

I started following QCOM back in 2016 and I knew almost everything about the lawsuits and the risks facing the company. In January and February, when the stock fell to the 50s, I started building my thesis and realized the following:

&#x200B;

Telecom Companies started tolling 5G networks.

Phone manufacturers are introducing 5G phones in 2019.

Huwaei and Qualcomm are the global leaders in 5G modems.

Intel is far behind in 5G technology and the sole supplier for AAPL modems.

AAPL cannot really introduce a 5G phone in 2019 if they don't settle with Qualcomm early in the year.

&#x200B;

Given the above, I was almost certain that the settlement will happen, and when I looked into options I knew the risk/return were exceptional so I decided to take a small position. Unfortunately for me, I got the timing just wrong because I haven't planned on rerolling my options and I took action at a time when I wasn't really aware of the complete consequences of selling my position. When I think about it now, I know how stupid that was, just because the option was trading at 0.03 when I put my limit order, and the only reason my order will be executed at 0.06 will be favorable news. If I analyzed that more at the time, I would have realized that putting the order is the worst possible decision. 

&#x200B;

A hard lesson for sure..",2019-04-16,378,169
awf88y_QCOM,QCOM,Qualcomm?,"Qualcomm, I believe is gonna be fantastic in the next 2 years. They already have a Gen2 5G Chip ready to ship to phone manufacturers while their two biggest competitors are either behind or being outlawed. Intel hasn’t even created a Gen1 Chip and won’t have the chips ready until after 2020. Huawei is caught doing illegal shit even though they have a really good chip. Although Qualcomm cut ties with Apple, they still got Samsung to supply the chips too which is of course a powerhouse when it comes to phones. It’s crazy to think that Qualcomm is already on their Gen2 chip while Intel hasn’t even started. By the time intel comes out with their own thing, who knows where Qualcomm will be? They’re relatively cheap right now after the whole Apple fiasco so I think right now is a great time to get into Qualcomm. ",2019-03-02,9,16

Because  they plan to buy back over $30 Billion in stock the price has being going up off late (~14% in the last month alone)

The appreciation in price due to buy backs although nice don't change anything about the underlying business. Their net profit margin  has been trending down along with operating profit has been trending down as well. Profit margin has been pretty flat and at 60% it lags behind its competitors.

They don't appear to be doing earning more and although the stock buyback increases EPS, on a real basis how will they increase their earning and profitability over the long run?

Qcom runs a pretty complex business. They have patents in lots of cellular technology and get paid in a variety of structures by companies that use their tech.

What are your thoughts? Please discuss and shed insight into their competitive strengths where you can for a bull case or the headwinds they face in a bear case.

I'm thinking the Broadcom buyout has a decent chance of moving to some type of agreement soon (even if it doesn't ultimately succeed) - especially if Broadcom wins several board seats on March 6.

I've only been trading options for a year (so I'm still not that experienced) and this is the first long straddle I've ever bought.

Obviously this is not a pure 50/50 straddle (edit: thus a strangle) but rather buying insurance on a directionally long position against a near term binary event 10:1

I'll get hit hard if the stock remains stable at $65 but aside from that I really like the risk/reward of this going into next week.
