I've been experimenting with a basic options trading strategy in QuantConnect and wanted to get your thoughts.

The idea is simple:  
When QQQ drops more than 1% from the previous day's close, I buy 1 near-the-money call option (20–40 DTE).  
I'm selecting the call that's closest to ATM and has the earliest expiry in that window.

The logic is based on short-term overreactions and potential bouncebacks. I'm using daily resolution and only buy one option per dip to keep things minimal.

Here’s the simplified logic in code:

    pythonCopyEditif dip_percentage >= 0.01 and not self.bought_today:
        chain = data.OptionChains[self.option_symbol]
        calls = [x for x in chain if x.Right == OptionRight.Call and x.Expiry > self.Time + timedelta(20)]
        atm_call = sorted(calls, key=lambda x: (abs(x.Strike - current_price), x.Expiry))[0]
        self.MarketOrder(atm_call.Symbol, 1)

The strategy works decently in short bursts, but over longer periods I notice drawdowns get pretty ugly, especially in choppy or slow-bear markets where dips aren't followed by strong recoveries.

* **Start Equity:** $100,000
* **End Equity:** $1,256,795.27
* **Net Profit:** \+1156.80%
* **Compounding Annual Return (CAR):** 28.28%
* **Max Drawdown:** 59.20%
* **Total Orders:** 221
* **Portfolio Turnover:** 14%
* **Total Fees:** $100.01

**Would love any tips or ideas on how to:**

* Reduce drawdowns
* Add basic filters (e.g., trend confirmation, volatility)
* Improve entry/exit logic (e.g., profit targets, time stops)

Has anyone tried something similar or have suggestions to make this more robust?

**What I have already tried:**

* **Selection Logic:**
   * Prefer **In-The-Money (ITM)** options (delta ≥ 0.6).
   * Choose **20–40 DTE** options.
   * Avoid **high IV** (implied volatility < 0.3).
* **Risk Management:**
   * Limit risk to **1–2%** of capital per trade.
   * Use **VIX filter** (don’t trade if VIX > 28).
   * Only trade when **QQQ > 200 SMA**.
   * **Cooldown period**: Wait 5 days between trades.
   * Exit after **7 days or 50% profit**, whichever comes first.

Appreciate any insights! 🙏",2025-05-27,5,6

1kledmg_QQQ,QQQ,Daytrading Entries (QQQ and/or SPY),"Hello,

I am wondering for those who are familiar with ORB and scalp QQQ/SPY, how do you decide on your entries? 

I have been looking for volume on one minute candles or retesting of VWAP, Highs, or Lows. It's usually very difficult because the volume quickly fades when moving between levels and the volume usually only last for a candle or two. Then as soon as there is breakdown or breakout, candles just cross the high/lows.

Is it because SPY/QQQ are aggregates of stock? 

More details: I use Robinhood legend. My indicators are volume, VWAP, RSI and I draw premarket highs and lows, previous day highs and lows, and 30 minute ORB.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2025-05-13,1,2

Hello to all you pro traders out there!

Does anyone know of any good free websites or apps that offer up-to-date news feeds—things like earnings report dates and times, PCE data, public commentary, trending topics, market sentiment, FOMO alerts, etc.?

I've been day trading for almost a year now. I was doing pretty well at first, but recently it's been a bit of a downturn. I'm using IBKR as my broker.

Sometimes I browse through Stocktwits for info, but honestly, it's tough—you have to sift through tons of noise before finding anything actually useful. And by that time, the opportunity has usually passed.

Recently I been also looking at QQQ chart also at this specific entry location, I am getting some mixed results, sometimes I find the way candle move on QQQ can be a leading indicator when it come to volume as well as overall candle locations, but there are times I also feel like its a bit of lagging as well.

  
So exactly what is the underlying logic of how QQQ move vs SPY? I know both index have a big underlying of the same stocks and I know QQQ tend to move a lot more volatile with higher ranges... But im not sure exaclty how does it move? I mean like is QQQ literally just part of SPY? If you trade SPY or QQQ, do you use the other chart as a reference, if so how.",2025-04-19,1,5

1jylujf_QQQ,QQQ,VOO vs QQQ ( an SCHD Pairing Question),"Hi, I’m seeking opinions on what ETF to pair with SCHD to help fill up my growth bucket. 

I am leaning towards QQQ ( or really QQQM) instead of VOO. My reasoning is that VOO contains 500 companies in various industries, and SCHD has overlap in many of those same companies/ industries. But QQQ is tilted towards tech, and in terms of total return QQQ has outperformed VOO for the last 5 and 10 years. 

So…. Thoughts? 


UPDATE: thanks for the feedback and options. I went with adding to my SCHD position, adding a smaller amount to QQQM for tech weighting and growth, and splitting my international exposure equally between VIGI and VYMI. ",2025-04-14,6,7

Specifically, I’m wondering what the chances are that we’ll see QQQ drop into the low 400s again within the next month.

A few things I’m considering:

- China recently announced new tariffs on certain U.S. goods, which could escalate tensions and negatively impact tech and growth stocks.

- Trump has been making off-and-on threats about reintroducing or increasing tariffs, which adds to the uncertainty around trade policy and future economic relations.

- Bonds are trending downward, and we’re seeing some volatility in the yield curve.

1jt2lqd_UPS,UPS,Bought 30k worth of QQQ LEAPS,"25M here. Huge believer of lifecycle investing and using leverage while one is young. Also, I was fortunate to get a job in the investment industry after graduating and learn a ton about derivatives and portfolio management. Not there anymore, as I appreciate having work-life balance.

I basically liquidated all my portfolio after Trump's liberation day to go (almost) all in QQQ Leaps. I bought some of them on Thursday while the market was down -15% from ATH, and then I averaged down again on Friday when the drawdown was -18%. I know it can go much lower, so I will continue adding to my position every month until December, doing kind of DCA but with leaps. Also, after holding them for 1 year I will roll them one year further. This way LEAPS just work as a stock-replacement strategy, but with huge leverage and without having to worry about expiration. 

I was too young to invest during the 2008 crash. I did not have money during the 2020 COVID crash. This is my moment to take risks. Everything sounds scary. Guess what? Companies will continue to innovate. Tariffs will go away. Technology will continue to disrupt the world and profit margins will expand again. 

By the way, I'm not worried about IV. It is extremely high for short-term options; not that much for LEAPS.  Also, a good thing about LEAPS is that you can't get margin called.

  
Positions:

1x QQQ Dec 18 2026 390 Call

1x QQQ Dec 18 2026 430 Call

1x QQQ Dec 18 2026 440 Call

1x QQQ Dec 18 2026 460 Call

  
Wish me luck. No risk, no gain.


EDIT: I'm seeing some people saying that I'm early. The truth is that nobody knows. Market timing does not work. Holding for years does. That's why I'm planning to roll indefinitely.
And if we do have a recession, this free fall has already priced in some of it, if not everything. The stock market is a machine of anticipating events before they actually happen, so waiting until we hit recession might be too late.
Also, IV is very high for short term options but LEAPS have not been affected that much. If stocks go up, IV is the last of my worries.
And if I'm wrong, I accept it. I can take the risk now. I will not be able to take it after I get married and have kids in the next decade. Now is the moment to do it.

I closed the position near the low today, and sold all 113 contracts for $27 each.

This was a roller coaster of a position. During the mid March drill down I was up about 200%, but kept holding. This past week I was down 75%, and said fuck it I’m holding and praying Trump tariffs drill the market, and well, the rest is history.

I definitely think the market will be heading lower from here but with expiry so soon, I can’t really be anymore greedy than I already am. I could very easily get caught in a bull trap/dead cat bounce next week and lose all of these gains.

Like they'll tease an downside breakout for days but instead it just keeps squeezing then when it does happen nobody expects it.  So your bias was right but you weren't right until you probably blew your account trying to short it. Just a lot of manipulation & psychological petty tactics they throw at retail. It feels like there isn't a single 1m candle that happens without intent and the chart is already mapped out from the open til close.

Because of the drop and how quickly it occurred, my mind went straight to looking for short opportunities today, and I did. If you look at the chart, around 10:30 we started re-tracing up making a lower high which was the start of this divergence. 

Little over an hour goes by and you can clearly see price action is making lower highs while the TSI is grinding upwards making higher highs, this is your number one indication that price may turn around soon. Waited for the sell signal, and took $470 0DTE Puts. Had to hold for a little longer than expected due to the small re-trace but didn’t last long. Hit my PT and ended my day. Could have held and grabbed much more.

$1,250 x 52 weeks = $65,000 annually 
$65,000 divided by 12 months = $5,400 / month 

QQQ mimicking NAS100 have an average growth of 10% a year for the past 5 decades. That means an additional $48K per year on average.

$65K + $48K(Appreciation) = $113,000 / year.

Some weeks you might have to roll up to avoid assignment but .20 delta is pretty good spot especially if you sell at a resistance level on a green day to get juicier premiums.

1j62098_QQQ,QQQ,QQQ 490 6/20 calls - when J POW has your back then it’s time to be greedy when others are fearful,"Closed 75 spy 606 5/18 puts on 3/4 when I felt market was oversold, and have been looking for an opportunity to buy calls to take advantage of an oversold market. Picked up 45 qqq 490 6/20 calls right before J Powell’s speech as a gamble on my feeling that market is oversold, and sentiment is too fearful. 

Below are some statements made by Powell that indicated his sentiment that things aren’t too bad right now, and also reassured me that the Fed will step in if things get too bad.

“While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”

  “If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.”

Powell takes his dual mandate very seriously, those of you whom traded back in 2020 remember the fed being instrumental to pulling the levers needed to protect the economy, encourage lending, which ultimately led to a v shaped market recovery in 04/2020. If things get bad enough (I don’t think they will), or policies become even more unpredictable (I’m not holding my breathe), Powell will step in again to uphold his mandate and protect our economy, and our investment portfolios.

I entered another good till cancelled limit order for 55 qqq 490 6/20 at $20. If it is not exercised that’s okay, if it is, then I get to “buy the dip.” I plan to hold on to my calls until qqq crosses 525,  or market sentiment significantly improves, whichever comes sooner. At that point I will go back to holding puts to hedge.

1idms3t_QQQ,QQQ,QQQ up with trash Q1 estimates - puts at open?,"Pulled out of the market yesterday. But a few interesting observations - everybody missed Q1 top line forecasts on growth.

Meta and Tesla crashed on earnings drop due to missing Q1 forecasts before recovering. Microsoft crashed after Q1 forecast released on earnings call.

Microsoft hinted ""data center computing"" execution driving capacity constraints through Q1, mirroring reports of Blackwell chips overheating earlier this year.

Not surprisingly, Deepseek inference cost reduction implications due to MOE approach yet to be factored in; capex estimates seem to be in line with end of year plans.

Apple on deck today. Profitability expected to be good due to efficiency in production, but Q1 forecasted top line also expected to be trash due to China and Apple intelligence failing.

Still a believer in big tech, but current multiples are historically high with interest rates still near historic highs in the near future which implies expectations of meteoric growth. There seems to be hell of a lot of risk in the market for big bets that won't play out for at least 6 months.

If this pump holds up: QQQ 2/14 520P

To be clear, not all bad news. Killer profitability from Meta, and Musk did a masterpiece on painting the future of FSD and Optimus sooner than we thought, but that's what Musk does.

1hr1zp3_QQQ,QQQ,Event Horizon: QQQ and more hundreds of ETFs Swirl into Bitcoin's Money Vortex!,"



 An infinite amount of cash in the federal reserve now flow into MicroStrategy stock, fueling Bitcoin growth. It's just the beginning.

Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy is already present in hundreds of ETFs and will likely join many more after entering the S&P 500, which is highly probable. 

ETFs ensure a constant cash flow directed toward share purchases, aiding Saylor's strategy of selling new shares to finance additional Bitcoin buys for the company.

 Many believe this dilutes shareholder capital, but that's because they haven't thoroughly researched and understood that he's selling share premiums and increasing Bitcoin per share.

Returning to the main point, MicroStrategy's ETF presence grows daily, attracting more passive income. Saylor utilizes this cash to buy more Bitcoin, increasing the company's market capitalization therefore ETF weight.

 This creates a snowball effect, infinitely fueled by the Federal Reserve's ability to print limitless money.

 Understand this: the more MicroStrategy receives from ETFs, the more its ETF weight increases, generating even more funds. This is a trend toward infinity, comprehensible to those familiar with the money printing problem.

 You're not bullish enough, for real!

 We're about to melt faces!""

1grfucj_QQQ,QQQ,PLTR to Move from NYSE to NASDAQ: Could QQQ Addition Spark a Rally?,"**Palantir Technologies Inc.** on **November 14, 2024 filed an 8k** detailing the company's decision to transfer its stock listing from the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** to the **Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq)**. This move will officially take place after market close on **November 25, 2024**, with trading on Nasdaq beginning on **November 26, 2024** under the same ticker symbol, **PLTR**.

# Key Highlights:

1. **Transfer of Listing**: Palantir notified the NYSE of its voluntary decision to move its Class A Common Stock listing to Nasdaq. This change is part of the company’s strategic move, potentially allowing it to meet eligibility requirements for inclusion in the **Nasdaq-100 Index**, a move that could increase visibility and attract new investors.
2. **Regulation FD Disclosure**: Alongside this notice, Palantir has issued a press release (Exhibit 99.1) informing the public of the transfer and addressing forward-looking statements related to its Nasdaq listing, potential index eligibility, and other speculative benefits.
3. **Forward-Looking Statements**: Palantir outlined expectations about the Nasdaq listing, but also noted that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect actual outcomes.

This transition to Nasdaq could indeed position **PLTR** for potential inclusion in tech-focused indexes like the **Nasdaq-100 (QQQ)**, which may increase trading volume and attract more institutional investors. As of November 14, 2024, institutional investors hold approximately 45.65% of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) stock[.](https://imgur.com/a/zrjFxK0)

Started with 3 combines this month blew one away and breakeven on the other 2 but loss more than half of my drawdown since I was up over 50% at one point and came back down. I am just getting tired of the process to get an payout with all these rules. Futures trading is already so difficult in itself.

Should I just go back to options?

 It is so easy to jump in & out of futures but while most will think this is an advantage I see this as the reason why futures trading is so dangerous cause it leads to overtrading & emotional tilt.

I believe that the US Labor market and US consumer are currently much weaker than what is being indicated by the media/FEDs at this time. Interest rates are going to fall very rapidly over the next year in attempt to prop up the labor market, and influence greater consumer credit spending. I do not believe this will work because of the present state of the average US consumer. Lowering interest rates can't help consumers who already don't have any sheckles.

The American consumer is completely broke and over levered, and additionally we are trending towards a tightening labor market, as corporations have been laying off more frequently due to over hiring during the pandemic, job openings are trending down, and unemployment is on the rise. I believe in the next 12-24 months we are going to bear witness to a Consumer Led Recession. For those of you that have made it this far, allow me to explain with some graphs.

**Saving Rates**  
""Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences""

US savings rates are at the same levels we experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, currently last reported at 2.9%. This means the American consumer has only been able to save 2.9% of their earnings towards their retirement, or to buy houses. In the second graph we can see this is trending downwards even still since COVID, as wages have not kept up with the high levels of inflation.

**YoY Household Expenditure**

Year-over-year household expenditures have up-ticked dramatically since the COVID bucks were printed. The average increase YoY change in Household Expenditures has historically been 3.074% since 1984 (close the average inflation rate in the US of 3.25% since 1973). The problem here arises in the second picture below. Household expenditures rose by 8.361% in 2021 and 8.276% in 2022, which is back-to-back years outside of 1 standard deviation away from the mean, highlighted as 5.693%. Tomorrow at 10:00 AM the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release their 2023 Household Expenditures data, it would not be shocking that 2023 was another above-average year, as the average inflation rate for that year was 4.1%.

**Unemployment**

Not much to say here, except the graph has begun moving upwards in the last 12-months.

**Job Openings**

Not much to say here, other than again Job Openings are trending downwards, albeit still above the average Job Openings rate (orange).

**Delinquency Rates Consumer Loans**

Here's where we get interesting again, Consumer Loan Delinquency rates are now currently above levels in 2011 and have continued to trend upwards in our heightened interest rate environment. This may infer two things: consumers have not changed their spending habits, or have become over levered. Orange line indicates the average since 1987.

**Delinquency Rates Credit Cards**

Delinquency rates on Credit cards are saying the exact same thing as consumer loans. Trending upwards, and above levels since 2011 in the era of low interest rates and lessened inflation.  
What I WILL say is that delinquencies on mortgages have not risen much, but that is an indicator than I am aggressively watching QoQ.

**US Deposits**

Deposits on checking, time and savings accounts for households are all going down and are currently all **BELOW** levels in 2019. This is indicating that consumers are currently being forced to draw on their savings previously established from the pandemic to survive, or keep up with their perceived levels of consumer spending. This is also inline with what you can hear from retailers, like Amazon, Walmart or fast-food businesses. Customers are becoming more ""value-orientated"", as they look for ways for their dollars to go further. [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html) is a great read from multiple earnings calls that highlight this.

All data I've presented is publicly available from the US FED or BLS. DYOD.

tl;dr US Consumer is broke. GDP may continue to grow but at a snails pace since consumers have no money to spend lavishly. Savings are going down and delinquencies are going up. Large credit risk, liquidity risks, and geopolitical risks are present.

Above is the daily chart for QQQ . I'm writing this in after hours for Sep 19 2024. So the day has already ended. As you can see in my lime green label on the chart. Today's volume on QQQ was 1.44x the 10 day average. So a biggish volume day. I remember about 30 mins after market open looking at that volume label and it was already at 33% of the last 10 day's average. I think by the 2 hour mark it was 50% of the last 10 day's average. So my thought at end of the first 30 mins, I had a high bias for up trend day. So I went long a few times today and took profit. Of cause it wasn't just the volume, the moving averages on all the higher time frames all looked bullish.Even the daily chart had a bullish bias going back several days ago when price broke above all the moving averages.

1ep1s50_QQQ,QQQ,SPY/QQQ have another 30% upside before a major correction. ,"I know this sounds crazy to most bears and probably bulls as well, but everything I’m charting and gathering from past recessions/bear markets tells me we still have plenty of room to go up before we should all consider buying long dated puts and singing YMCA

First from chart perspective, both SPY and QQQ are above their 50 and 100 daily moving averages and they have both support around strong Fibonacci levels. If they both manage to  reclaim August, as in forming either a bullish reversal on the weekly candle or forming a bullish hammer on the month (SPY 550 or QQQ 460) than we are 100% likely to see a strong blow off top before end of the year as we are also in an election year which is very bullish.

Second, we are all aware of the obvious which is the consumer is weakening (see earnings for most consumer stocks) and that credit debt is rising. But we do know that tech spending is still high. Amazon, microsoft and meta are all raising capex regardless of the consumer. They know the key *now* is to prepare for leveraging AI as a service. They can weather a 12-24 month recession. They have *billions* in cash with very low debt to equity ratios.

So as such, expect Nvidia earnings to keep rising, and for Amazon/microsofts cloud services and AI systems to grow while their more consumer side of business slows down or goes stagnant for the next year.

Third, I expect layoffs and mass defaulting to occur sooner rather than later. But I do not think this will impact the stock market. Until tech is positioned to stop giving every dollar they can possibly shovel to the mag 7, once all infrastructure is tapped out and exhausted, will we see the market turn over and retrace. The fed will likely raise rates in September and we will see the yield curve potentially uninvert after more than three years. But it will take 6-12 months before this causes a market downturn because we will rally from the news for quite some time.

For SPY; long to 650, short to 500 level. Don’t do anything else till then. ",2024-08-10,102,226
1enq86o_TM,TM,Been trying to predict the QQQ next day moves. Anyone has any inputs? Description and picture.,"I have been trying to look for specific patterns in the options chain of QQQ to predict what would happen for the next day (if up, down or sideways).

But sometimes none of this makes sense, I get the same patterns I have had before, and the ETF does completely the opposite. I always look 15 minutes before close for the options series of the next day. I thought the market was forward looking and so the options would be priced in for the next day. Does anyone know what am I missing? What could be another option's chain value or indicator that I am missing to properly tell the direction of the ETF (QQQ, SPY or IWM) for the next day?

1. When QQQ's EMA 10 and EMA 20 have a golden cross and EMA 20 crosses above EMA 144 (uptrend), buy several deep ITM QQQ calls with a 3-month expiration and sell on the last day. If it breaks below EMA 144 in the meantime, stop-loss.

ANALYSIS: 

* Key economic data to come today, with inflation expectations and Durable goods.
* Skew and positioning on EURUSD points higher, so expectation is for dollar to fall form key level of 105, but lets see. 
* SPX Skew points higher, QQQ closed above 450 wall which is supportive. SPX shows increasing call volume, and some put selling. 
* Probably see lower volatility today as IV remains lower, but traders are still bullish and it looks like today will be a choppy day with upward direction, but lets see. 
* 5300 wall. 
* Positioning unchanged after yesterday. Basically no impact, market brushed it off it seems. But lets see with the data. 

Update on yesterday:

* If we saw on spx last few days there was some hedging some hedging prior to fomc and nvda in previous updates but bullish positioning overall.
* Even though nvda earnings came decent, and I'd say decent rather than amazing because of gross margin guidance, market still sold off because of hawkishness of yday fomc minutes plus some China Taiwan fears which r overblown for sure. Also PMI data came strong as did Jobless claims, which got traders doubting rate cuts again.
* Bsically, traders were taking this as an opportunity to trim, ahead of holiday weekend and using the ample liquidity there on NVDA earnings. Premarket moves dont always predict market open moves btw. Premarket has low volume and often fools investors, so whilst SPX and QQQ pumped in premarket, you had to look in the first half an hr, especially after jobless claims came hot to understand what the market is doing.
* Institutions are still long on this market btw. Id take this as a look that lots of stocks starting to present opportunities again as the market pulls back.
* BTW pull back is even a bit mcuj to say. The Iran pullback was a pullback, this is a 1% dip from ATH.
* Still, for me I think there are things that now look more attractive, some in semis, smci, crypto miners, many industrial names as dow comes back to 39k.
* Would still bet on 5300 return. More later

  
BTW gold and silver positioning looks like a BUy the dip coming.

1cziy7l_WBD,WBD,"I'm a full time trader and this is my full pre market cheat sheet, including full positioning updates for SPX and QQQ following yesterdays dip. Whats changed in the market? ","**24/05**

ANALYSIS: 

* Key economic data to come today, with inflation expectations and Durable goods.
* Skew and positioning on EURUSD points higher, so expectation is for dollar to fall form key level of 105, but lets see. 
* SPX Skew points higher, QQQ closed above 450 wall which is supportive. SPX shows increasing call volume, and some put selling. 
* Probably see lower volatility today as IV remains lower, but traders are still bullish and it looks like today will be a choppy day with upward direction, but lets see. 
* 5300 wall. 
* Positioning unchanged after yesterday. Basically no impact, market brushed it off it seems. But lets see with the data. 

Update on yesterday:

* If we saw on spx last few days there was some hedging some hedging prior to fomc and nvda in previous updates but bullish positioning overall.
* Even though nvda earnings came decent, and I'd say decent rather than amazing because of gross margin guidance, market still sold off because of hawkishness of yday fomc minutes plus some China Taiwan fears which r overblown for sure. Also PMI data came strong as did Jobless claims, which got traders doubting rate cuts again.
* Bsically, traders were taking this as an opportunity to trim, ahead of holiday weekend and using the ample liquidity there on NVDA earnings. Premarket moves dont always predict market open moves btw. Premarket has low volume and often fools investors, so whilst SPX and QQQ pumped in premarket, you had to look in the first half an hr, especially after jobless claims came hot to understand what the market is doing.
* Institutions are still long on this market btw. Id take this as a look that lots of stocks starting to present opportunities again as the market pulls back.
* BTW pull back is even a bit mcuj to say. The Iran pullback was a pullback, this is a 1% dip from ATH.
* Still, for me I think there are things that now look more attractive, some in semis, smci, crypto miners, many industrial names as dow comes back to 39k.
* Would still bet on 5300 return. More later

  
BTW gold and silver positioning looks like a BUy the dip coming.   


DATA LEDE:

* UK Consumer Confidence survey came in at -17, vs -18 forecast. Consumer confidence on the main part is improving in UK, mostly because consumers are coming to expect rate cuts by BOE. We see below though that retail sales came weak. 

JAPAN INFLATION RATE:

* Comes in at 2.5%, one of lowest readings in last year, down from 2.7% before. 
* Core inflation comes in 2.2% in line with forecasts, again one of lowest readings in last year. 

German GDP final revision came in line with preliminary readings. 

Weak retail sales in UK.

* Ex fuel Came -3% YOY vs -1.1% expected. 
* CLOTHING, SPORTS, GAMES and TOY STORES and FURNITURE STORES did badly.
* They said it was because of poor weather that footfall was lower.

* Also, importantly, Michigan Consumer Sentiment numbers, which will include 5 year and 1 year inflation expectations.
* Inflation expectations expected to tick higher to one of the highest readings in last year at 3.5% for 1 year. 
* An upside surprise here will not be good and will send dollar higher.

* Nasdaq: Fell from 18,930 to 18,560. Recovered slightly in premarket, back to 18,700. 
* Dow: Fell to 39k, after trading at 40k just earlier this week. Recovering slightly in premarket. 
* HKG50 market initially moved higher in first hour, from 18,650 to 18,850, before falling back to 18,530. So sold off all intraday gains. 
* GER40: Recovering slightly candlestick fell close to 18,500 then pushed higher.

* AUDUSD moving back lower towards trend line, sold off the breakout that it was seeing.  DXY rejected off 105. 



MAG 7:

* TSLA - Slashes Model Y production in Shanghai, data shows  TSLA - Musk says he opposes US tariffs on Chinese EVs. Probably saying this because China are starting to retaliate with tariffs on US vehicles too, which is why Tesla is going down. 
* TSLA still up in premarket but barely so. 
* NVDA - DZ Bank downgrades to hold from buy, PT of 1025. 
* NVDA - most advanced AI chip for China is facing weak demand, forcing the firm to price it below a rival chip from Huawei, says Reuters. Abundant supply fo H20, which signals weak demand. 
* DESPITE THIS, NVDA HIGHER IN PERMARKET. Continuation of Stocksplit bullishness.

1cziy7l_JPM,JPM,"I'm a full time trader and this is my full pre market cheat sheet, including full positioning updates for SPX and QQQ following yesterdays dip. Whats changed in the market? ","**24/05**

ANALYSIS: 

* Key economic data to come today, with inflation expectations and Durable goods.
* Skew and positioning on EURUSD points higher, so expectation is for dollar to fall form key level of 105, but lets see. 
* SPX Skew points higher, QQQ closed above 450 wall which is supportive. SPX shows increasing call volume, and some put selling. 
* Probably see lower volatility today as IV remains lower, but traders are still bullish and it looks like today will be a choppy day with upward direction, but lets see. 
* 5300 wall. 
* Positioning unchanged after yesterday. Basically no impact, market brushed it off it seems. But lets see with the data. 

Update on yesterday:

* If we saw on spx last few days there was some hedging some hedging prior to fomc and nvda in previous updates but bullish positioning overall.
* Even though nvda earnings came decent, and I'd say decent rather than amazing because of gross margin guidance, market still sold off because of hawkishness of yday fomc minutes plus some China Taiwan fears which r overblown for sure. Also PMI data came strong as did Jobless claims, which got traders doubting rate cuts again.
* Bsically, traders were taking this as an opportunity to trim, ahead of holiday weekend and using the ample liquidity there on NVDA earnings. Premarket moves dont always predict market open moves btw. Premarket has low volume and often fools investors, so whilst SPX and QQQ pumped in premarket, you had to look in the first half an hr, especially after jobless claims came hot to understand what the market is doing.
* Institutions are still long on this market btw. Id take this as a look that lots of stocks starting to present opportunities again as the market pulls back.
* BTW pull back is even a bit mcuj to say. The Iran pullback was a pullback, this is a 1% dip from ATH.
* Still, for me I think there are things that now look more attractive, some in semis, smci, crypto miners, many industrial names as dow comes back to 39k.
* Would still bet on 5300 return. More later

  
BTW gold and silver positioning looks like a BUy the dip coming.

* EURUSD resistance at 1.08. positioning overall is still bullish.
* Probably see it chop around 1.08 and 1.075.
* Positioning against dollar is increasing, as traders unwind some of their shorts on CHF, EUR, JPY etc, as they expect USD to fall on more dovish monetary policy.
* GOLD looks like we are seeing more accumulation and chop before a possible break higher. Probably see similar in Silver too, as IV not increasing OTM on calls, so traders not looking for a breakout just yet but positioning still recovering.
* Today, Skew on QQQ and SPX are relatively flat. 440 is key wall that QQQ will be trying to get on top of.
* VIX is at 13.5, but not seeing much puts open up OTM which tells us it probably doesnt yet crush much lower.
* As such we probably see a choppy day.

1cmaf5v_DDOG,DDOG,"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket, including positioning analysis on EURUSD, GOLD, SPX and QQQ","ANALYSIS:

* EURUSD resistance at 1.08. positioning overall is still bullish.
* Probably see it chop around 1.08 and 1.075.
* Positioning against dollar is increasing, as traders unwind some of their shorts on CHF, EUR, JPY etc, as they expect USD to fall on more dovish monetary policy.
* GOLD looks like we are seeing more accumulation and chop before a possible break higher. Probably see similar in Silver too, as IV not increasing OTM on calls, so traders not looking for a breakout just yet but positioning still recovering.
* Today, Skew on QQQ and SPX are relatively flat. 440 is key wall that QQQ will be trying to get on top of.
* VIX is at 13.5, but not seeing much puts open up OTM which tells us it probably doesnt yet crush much lower.
* As such we probably see a choppy day.

from 421 to 413 is about 7 points, and that's about 37% of being ITM.

At 4/25 EOD, if my 413sp was not ITM, then am I safe?

* Can I invest in these 3 funds, QQQ/SCHD/IVV equally split 3 ways each?
* Or is there a better way to allocate it?

Another thought:

* 50% ($125,000) in QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)
* 30% ($75,000) in IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF)
* 20% ($50,000) in SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF)

The key reasons for this strategy:

1. Overweight QQQ (50%) to capture more aggressive growth potential from the Nasdaq-100 index of large-cap growth stocks.
2. Maintain a 30% allocation to IVV to provide broad exposure to the overall U.S. stock market for stable long-term growth.
3. Reduce the allocation to the more defensive SCHD dividend stock fund to 20%, as the priority is aggressive growth over income at your age.

What is the annual ROI for QQQ buy and hold from 2011-2023?

**Backstory:**  
I came across [this insightful post](https://financial-hacker.com/the-gap-momentum-system/) on The Financial Hacker, implementing Perry Kaufman's Gap Momentum indicator in a strategy that trades QQQ from 2011-2023.

I'm considering implementing the strategy in Python (if I do, I'll share results), but one commenter highlighted something that made me second guess the author's results. 

The commenter Silva points out that the 12% annual return mentioned in the strategy doesnt beat the annual return of QQQ buy and hold as the author claims.

I'm not familiar with the Annual ROI metric, but a quick look at the QQQ chart suggests that you'd make a lot more than 12% on average, annually.

Any thoughts? What do you get when you calculate QQQ Annual ROI over that period?

1bpv6en_SPY,SPY,2 to 1 Leverage on SPY/QQQ 50/50 split?,"I was reading about that Yale study where they recommend it.   I back tested and seems to work well.

  
Question, How are they implementing it?  say you have a 10k port and can add 500 bucks a month.  

&#x200B;

Are they suggesting borrow 10k on margin and then slowly pay off.  Or borrow 500 extra each month and round your DCA to 1k/month.  

&#x200B;

Has anyone follow this strategy and how are you using the 2:1 leverage, just dumping it all in? ",2024-03-28,24,55

1bmvxpq_ANET,ANET,Why I am taking QQQ calls on Monday,"March: In like a Lion, out like a Lamb...

The start of this month was quite unsettling with the bombardment of catalysts which included CPI, PPI and FOMC. With those headwinds behind us, I believe March will wrap up sweet for the bulls. Seasonality wise next week is one of the best weeks of the year for QQQ. I know seasonality to some can be BS but in a bull market, seasonality is a fair metric to CALIBRATE future predictions. 

Last week we got a boost from FOMC, pushing the Qs from \~445 to \~447. Honestly a small move for such a substantial FOMC catalyst. I think there is more in the tank for this week and seasonality suggests so. (Note: this upcoming bullish QQQ week can be credited to MSFT for also having one of its best weeks on the horizon as well) 

\----

Hopefully Monday is flat/closes red with Consumer Confidence uncertainty looming (data is released on Tues), no matter the result of CC I think we rally hard tues into the remainder of the week to stay on par with QQQ's bullish seasonality. 

* Take weekly QQQ 445 strike calls + QQQ weekly 447 calls 
* *Optional:* MSFT 415 strike, May 17 calls (I already own one but plan on adding another if Monday is red) 

LMK your thoughts, seasonality has been one of the best metrics for me so far (Cashed on ANET last week which has 70% + in March) Lets ride fellas!

2. Ended 2023 with topping tail; 205.49 must be negated on weekly basis, then 208 - 213 will be major resistance
3. Descending TL (ATH-to-8/4/23 high) is major support; will converge with COVID low TL by Summer 2024

somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here.",2023-12-20,64,73

Now near 460, it's entirely possible the same thing happens at this level, but there are some things to keep an eye out for that could signal a pickup in vol.

On Friday IWM was up nearly 3%. And IWM vol, as measured by the RVX was up 2%.

17qmy81_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves SPX, QQQ, Disney, Trade Desk and more","  
I've mentioned this before here (and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/OptionsLearn/status/1721537375145271673)) that traders can be on the lookout for a few signs this week that the vega/gamma backdrop of the market has shifted on a dime. 0DTE expected moves of just 0.5% - 0.6% make sense (they were twice that last week when VIX was 22) if dips get bought, rallies find sellers etc. This would be a complete 180 from the steady declines we saw in October followed by the face rip higher we saw last week.

The first couple days of this week have indeed been low realized vol days (compared to the prior few weeks)  resulting in a slow grind higher in SPX QQQ etc. Some things to continue to watch when the market does finally go red, does that move get bought at about the expected move or does it plow right through to the downside? And do green days look more like slow grinds higher rather than the FOMO panic buying we saw last week? 

Market makers can get jammed with options after a VIX collapse. Here's how that works and why it can stop the market on a dime. The VIX was 22 going into last week. Market makers are sellers of options with the VIX 22, but they are not ""all in"" sellers because there's a chance IV goes higher on a market capitulation where they would want to really sell alot of vega with the VIX 30 or higher. With the market reversal higher last week they never got the chance to sell 30 VIX, and to add insult to injury, vol collapses so quickly they are getting sold options the entire rally, while the puts they sold at the lows are so quickly out of the money they no longer even register as short vega anymore. So out of nowhere they may be getting LONG options with the VIX 18-19. That loads the market with gamma and buyers of stock below and sellers of stock above (as all that premium needs to be scalped to cover theta. Market makers would then keep lowering vol across the board.

Those are the conditions where you can sometimes see a really low VIX as the day to day vol of the market gets crushed and alot of folks are choking on long straddles. 

Of course it is still earnings season, and we are seeing some very large moves in individual stocks. Today we hear from Disney among others (full list below). Powell's speech this morning is potentially market moving.

I've mentioned this before here (and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/OptionsLearn/status/1721537375145271673)) that traders can be on the lookout for a few signs this week that the vega/gamma backdrop of the market has shifted on a dime. 0DTE expected moves of just 0.5% - 0.6% make sense (they were twice that last week when VIX was 22) if dips get bought, rallies find sellers etc. This would be a complete 180 from the steady declines we saw in October followed by the face rip higher we saw last week.

The first couple days of this week have indeed been low realized vol days (compared to the prior few weeks)  resulting in a slow grind higher in SPX QQQ etc. Some things to continue to watch when the market does finally go red, does that move get bought at about the expected move or does it plow right through to the downside? And do green days look more like slow grinds higher rather than the FOMO panic buying we saw last week? 

Market makers can get jammed with options after a VIX collapse. Here's how that works and why it can stop the market on a dime. The VIX was 22 going into last week. Market makers are sellers of options with the VIX 22, but they are not ""all in"" sellers because there's a chance IV goes higher on a market capitulation where they would want to really sell alot of vega with the VIX 30 or higher. With the market reversal higher last week they never got the chance to sell 30 VIX, and to add insult to injury, vol collapses so quickly they are getting sold options the entire rally, while the puts they sold at the lows are so quickly out of the money they no longer even register as short vega anymore. So out of nowhere they may be getting LONG options with the VIX 18-19. That loads the market with gamma and buyers of stock below and sellers of stock above (as all that premium needs to be scalped to cover theta. Market makers would then keep lowering vol across the board.

Those are the conditions where you can sometimes see a really low VIX as the day to day vol of the market gets crushed and alot of folks are choking on long straddles. 

Of course it is still earnings season, and we are seeing some very large moves in individual stocks. Today we hear from Disney among others (full list below). Powell's speech this morning is potentially market moving.

Does majority opinion rule for intra-day trading?

Little bit of an opinion piece here.

I like to web scrape. I’ve been scraping trades placed on Kalshi throughout the day, which is an event-based trading platform.

I’m focusing on two events: where the NASDAQ will close and where the SPY will close for the current trading day.

By tracking money placed in favor of price increases and money placed in favor of price deceases - I’d like to trade with the majority.

This is an elementary train of thought - stemming from my days playing kahoot in elementary school.

No matter the question (ie it could have been as random as our teacher’s summer vacation), the majority opinion of the class was almost always correct.

I know that Kalshi is limited in the opinions it’s collecting, but how do people feel about this - especially if it had 100x the traffic/scope?

Is the money flowing in favor and against SPY and QQQ a result of the past price changes, or are people viewing said change and voting on where they think the stock will head next?",2023-10-16,11,11

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

https://preview.redd.it/71ypjsocddtb1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd16f07f8fa9b516525dbd24eca8bb8427b5f0dc

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.

These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.

**Earnings Season**

Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.

171kbxf_QQQ,QQQ,$70k Puts QQQ: The World Will Burn Edition,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ac6ogl8vzmsb1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=f437cff7c09719c672da1f6234dd61c22063bd83

[https://imgur.com/a/zXXZQHp](https://imgur.com/a/zXXZQHp)

Sick of you fucking zoomer newf\*\*\* mouthing off about the world ending when you don't even have any positions. Here are mine: 18 $370 puts QQQ 1/19/24, and 15 $370 puts QQQ 6/21/24. It doesn't quite add up to $70k anymore because today has been a right shit day sitting on a giant green nail attached to the mechanical bull I'm riding.

Here is a list of reasons the QQQ will soon be known as the river of tears ""Q\_Q fucking Q"", in no particular order:

1. Essentially back at all time highs, as if the beerflu tech bubble never popped. It didn't make sense back then when interest rates were zero and there wasn't anything else to buy, and it is pants on head regarded right now.

2. Interest rates are back to normal levels, which after the 2007 financial crisis, means they are astronomically high and no one who survived the last fifteen years of ""buy every dip"" investing remembers what the fuck it means when fixed income is making more of a return than equities.

3. Bond yields are going to keep going up. I had TLT puts until Monday and sold them for a nice profit, wish I kept them for Tuesday too but oh well. I'm fucking terrified of bear market rallies but that's also why I still have money. 5% on the long end is not the top, it's just a temporary stop even if they go down for a bit. The deficit is around 4% of GDP, there is not even enough discretionary spending to balance the budget anymore, and military/social security/medicare are not going to be cut by a third. The deficits will continue and that means inflation will continue at the same rate since it will all be paid for by issuing debt that will be bought by the money printer. Eventually bond buyers will decide they aren't getting paid enough for inflation and yields will go into a death spiral until we decide to scuttle aircraft carriers and let Gam Gam starve. On top of this no one is buying bonds anymore except speculators, and they're going to eventually have to cover (sell) to end the bleeding. Foreigners are selling either because they need the money (Japan) or they don't want to write off their holdings when they get sanctioned (China). Oil princes also don't need to buy treasuries as much when they aren't selling oil only in dollars anymore. Yes I know bonds are worth less than half of what they were recently, but they can go down another half if yields go up to 7.5% from 5%.

4. Tech stocks are grossly overvalued right now. QQQ current P/E is 30, their forward P/E is 26. SPY is about 19 for both. EPS in tech are going down this earnings season, not up like people think. Here's some helmet math, at current P/E, EPS has to go up 50% just to match the current 10 year yield. At 7.5% it will need to go up 125%. Expectations are for something like 15% EPS growth this quarter, but every company is going to be guiding down and some may guide losses. Tesla is cutting prices, NVIDIA is going to see a slowdown in orders, Apple is going to start seeing a global decline for the first time, Facebook is just going to lose money as advertisers cut budgets, Amazon and Google are going to see regulatory threats to break them up and eliminate their network advantages. Microsoft will tread water. AI is a fucking joke and a huge compliance risk to any corporate business. My 1/19/24 puts are for this play. At some point I'll make them into spreads when earnings get priced in.

5. Economics 101 is that trade raises net prosperity. The last thirty plus years of wealth has been driven in very large part by globalization. Your grandpa might have lost that sweet factory job but all your cheap toys came from China. Get used to whittling wooden toys again for your own kids because that's about all you'll be able to afford in consumer goods. At least you'll be able to find a job to buy locally grown beans and a locally built piece of shit Chevy, though. Deglobalization is going to drive prices through the roof and that's going to keep fueling inflation. If you think semiconductors are expensive now, wait until China puts a blockade on Taiwan because if they can't have semis, no one can. My long term 6/21/24 put spreads are for long term trends. I have $330 puts sold against these and I'm going to keep selling far out of the money monthly spreads on these to stay theta positive.

As of now the JPM collar has officially rolled and here it is… now keep in mind that this does sometimes get slightly adjusted by Monday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j65bm6df79rb1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd02fbf0190bb9c01df4ca250420cc8848b2ea5

As of now we are looking at

Short call 4500  
 Long put 4050  
 Short put 3410

Now to keep this simple what do you need to know about the JPM collar? Not much to be honestly but in generally in my experience we will maintain our price action somewhere between 4050 and 4500 till it rolls again. It is very notable that the collar was rolled below the previous collar. 

While the collar is clearly not made to be directional trade it is notable that we should expect 4500 or 4050 (if not both) to be touched before EOY. With 4050 SPX being below the high of year I would not expect any new ATHS this year at all… Based off this my expectation actually is that we will see SPX break into the 3900s before EOY. 

**Government shutdown**

Its obviously not a super common thing to have a true government shutdown…. And this is not to be political as im only talking about what SPY did… 

2 out of the 3 last shut downs the week before we closed red (spy is closing red barely this week)  
 2 out of 3 times the first day the market was open of the shutdown we closed green actually   
 3 out of 3 times we closed green the day the shutdown ended  
 3 out of 3 times the total movement from shutdown to opening was green  
 2 out of 3 times the week after the shutdown ended was green.

Next week is gonna be another data heavy week. We are looking at JPOW himself speaking yet again Monday at 11am… yesterdays education session was a massive nothing burger. 

JOLTS on Tuesday, ADP/ PMI Wednesday, challenger jobs and unemployment claims Thursday and then unemployment rate on Friday… that is a ton of data that will be very interesting to watch how markets react. The bigger one to watch is UE on Friday… if we see that UE rate drop then we can expect even more pain from JPOW.

We were finally able to get back to the 430.4 demand and take that level out… however, we hard rejected off the daily 8ema and also over 432.22 supply. 

Interestingly enough the daily DMI is already nearing overbought and we remain in extreme bear momentum. 

Short under 425.76 with a target of 417.79 and long over 432.22 with a target of 436.2/79.

While we did break through the year long daily bull channel support… we are still holding our weekly bull channel support. That support for next week will sit at 422.66 which is just over this weeks low. 

We took our 427.35 supply this week also. 

We have closed a full candle below the weekly 8/20ema supports for the first time since December 2022. We did have a really hard bounce off that weekly 50ema support though. 

From here we have upside targets at 433.04 to 437.62 and downside targets of 416.08 to 411.57. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS

Futures also pumped enough to take out that 4362 demand and had a really hard rejection off the daily 8ema resistance. 

Short under 4319 with target of 4273/ 4240 and long over 4384 with target of 4458.

**FUTURES WEEKLY** 

&#x200B;

Futures came down and took out 4284 supply. With that drop we perfectly bounced off the year long bull channel support line. That weekly support sits at 4292 for next week. 

Both spy and futures weekly candles are dojis which certainly could lead to a potential upside reversal. 

Bulls need to get this back over 4385 minimally and bears want a closure under 4260 for downside continuation. 

FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4193-> 4516  
 Demand- 4381-> 4130

Looking at QQQ here we did have a pretty large breakout to take out 362.01 demand. But we had a pretty massive failed breakout and rejection off the daily 8ema to close back under that level. 

The daily continues to fight and pivot around the 100ema support/ resistance. 

Long over 359.71 with target of 372… short under 354.13 with target of 347.93/ 349.06.

**QQQ WEEKLY**

QQQ weekly is already through its year long bull channel support and now I would say is in an official downtrend since July. 

This weekly doji here certainly has the potential to an upside reversal here, however, we closed beneath the weekly 8 and 20ema support. 

359.48 and 365.12 will be major resistance to watch. There actually are no levels I have here from 330.67 to 359.48. My downside target would be weekly 50ema near 338.38.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 375.84 -> 330.67

Taking a look at VIX here I actually would be far more bearish on Monday than just looking at spy/ qqq daily. The VIX came down and had an incredibly hard bounce off the daily 20ema support line to come all the way back up and defend the 16.9 demand on the daily. 

What I find very impressive and all telling here is that the VIX is back to 17.56 while SPY is back to 427.48. The VIX essentially is $2 lower than it was the last time SPY was here which certainly means a run back to 18.95/ 19.56 could bring heavy downside. 

IF VIX breaks and closes over 18.95/19.56 then I would fully expect much more downside on SPY, however, if the VIX can close under 16.9 then we are likely to see another attempt at a relief rally. ",2023-09-29,4,3
16sz2dv_JPM,JPM,"The JPM Collar is insight… 9-26-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","  

Last week I expected that we could see a possible Monday and Tuesday relief rally followed by heavy selling into the EOW. We only got the Monday bounce and today ended up as a very big bear day mostly related to a few speaker last night saying we likely will get another rate hike before EOY and JPM releasing an article saying we could see the federal funds rate hit 7% (that would be 7 more 25 bps hikes FYI).

I personally believe we are going to potentially see a bear market by EOY… Spy is about 16% away, QQQ is about 14% away and SPX is about 16% away…

I actually was expecting a continuation day to the upside to test the daily 100 ema resistance today, however, we actually started a next leg down… We have officially reached the critical and bulls last stand… the daily 200ema support. IF we lose and hold under the daily 200ema support this sell off is likely to turn into a major correction. 

Today we not only broke through the short term bear channel support (making this an even more extreme sell off) but we broke through the longer bear channel support too… This green support line you are seeing is the bull channel support for the year long bull channel we have been in…. that support sits at 424.5 tomorrow… if we break that effectively the bull move is over and we can start to look at an official bear trend. 

We took out supply at 428.06 today and put in a new supply at 432.22. 

Our next support is 422.04. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 422.04 -> 432.22

Much like SPY futures took out the 4312 supply today and put in a new supply at 4384. Looking at futures here we have clearly established the daily 100ema as resistance and now we will see if the daily 200ema can be defended as last stand for the bulls. 

One really interesting thing to me is the fact that the daily DMI has been 100% oversold (flat lined at 0… meaning litereally cant even move any further down) for 5 days now… over the last two years the longest we ever saw the DMI flat lined oversold or overbought was 4 days. There is a ton of momentum to this selling and we are entering extreme bear momentum. 

An extensive sell off into the EOY is shaping up here. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS

Now one notable difference in QQQ from SPY/ Futes is that the daily DMI actually is in a wave up process while we are falling. Until today QQQ had been holding the daily 100ema as support and actually was looking fairly stable compared to SPY. Today the 100ema officially became resistance. Tech in my opinion has still not fully joined in the sell off… once they do is when we start to see capitulation and 2-2.5% red days. 

QQQ next major support area is 347.93/349.06.

I know a lot of people don’t understand why I still follow the VIX or why I do supply/ demand on the VIX… however, more times than not the VIX remains helpful and on point. Today the VIX led the selloff… I mentioned last week that until we closed over 17.2/17.91 supply on the VIX daily we would not see the next leg down… today the VIX finally not only broke it but closed over it and put in a new demand at 16.9.

If the VIX breaks and closes over 19.56 we start the next leg down (likely under 200ema) if the VIX breaks and closes over 22.67… we are looking at full on capitulation and some extremely bloody days in this market. 

Anything over 26.17 and I would not be surprised to see SPY re-enter a bear market. ",2023-09-26,7,8
16r2uz6_CCL,CCL,"Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.","Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting. 

The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future. 

For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:

https://preview.redd.it/ga156iq9i8qb1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=deef6e981dc525ff4abdf70c04272cdf0eb39f1a

And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:

There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:

16r2uz6_NKE,NKE,"Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.","Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting. 

The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future. 

For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:

And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:

16oqhjm_NEE,NEE,"Post-FOMC Bleed… Eyes on JPM Collar Puts… 9-21-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","  

After a very hawk Powell spoke yesterday and basically told the market that there was a ton of uncertainty and set up a bearish dot plot… I expect blood to be in the water today… I am however a little surprised by how well market held up all day long… until power hour markets maintained a $2.5 range and finally broke a $3 range into power hour…. 

The question is now… what comes next? Do we continue to bleed or was this just a one off day? Depending on where the weekly closes tomorrow… we could be setting up for an extremely bearish end of month. 

&#x200B;

The above chart on the left is June 2022 when we got a surprise rate hike… the chart on the right for SPY daily looks incredibly similar…

&#x200B;

Something no one is talking about right now is the JPM collar… now anyone who has followed me for a long time knows I love the collar and love the weeks leading into the collar… we have a tendency to finish either near the long put (4215) or the short calls (4670)… as of right now… we are only about 3.9% away from the puts… for those of you that don’t know the Collar will roll on September 29th. 

I would not be surprised to see us drop into the collars puts next week. 

Something that is still mind blowing to me is that we have not had a -2% day since February 21st… actually that’s as far as I can tell our only -2%+ day all year which considering we had a whole bank run fiasco in March is incredible. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0tigsdge5opb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79691368c4d0e1a4d3ecfe78d59333c4c85964e

The daily here is beyond extreme bear… WE not only broke through the daily 100ema but we closed a full candle below the daily 100ema support for the first time since March 2015. 

Now I will say we are 100% oversold on the daily DMI so there is definitely a need for a bounce here but we are also approaching extreme bear momentum here on the daily now. 

We are well below our 436.2 and 436.79 double demand and we actually came down to at the very last second to touch the 431.37 demand. 

From a weekly stand point here if we close under 437.62 I am bearish for next week… if we close under 433.04 then I am extremely bearish for next week and I would be looking for the low 420s to be retested. Realistically bulls need to get this back over the 437.62 minimum. 

If this plays out like June and repeats that pattern we likely will close in the 420s for the first time since the beginning of June. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 429.13 -> 428.06 -> 422.04  
 Demand- 431.37 -> 429.86 -> 426.57

From a daily stand point here on futures the fact that we are going to close under the 4374/4383 triple demand area is incredibly bearish. Honestly I am very surprised we were able to get that low and not only that but close under it. With a daily closure under the 100ema now and that triple demand area our sights are set on 4292 to 4312.

Now again the daily DMI is 100% oversold and that does warrant a potential bounce… but I would expect that bounce to be very short lived. 

The next major target is the daily 200ema which is 4285.

From a weekly stand point anything under 4381 is very bearish and bulls minimally need to close over 4395.

FUTURES DAILY   
 Supply- 4312 -> 4298 -> 4292 -> 4240

Taking a look at QQQ here we did manage to break through and close under the daily 100ema support also. We also broke through our double demand/ support area at 358.53/ 362.01. With that being broken through we should start to target 347.93 to 349.06 double demand area. 

Much like SPY the Qs is 100% oversold on daily DMI but it also is approaching extreme bear momentum. 

From a weekly stand point the Qs need to minimally close under 359.48 to be bearish and the bulls minimally need it over 359.48.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 337.6  
 Demand- 349.06 -> 347.93 -> 336.37

The VIX had one heck of a day today… WE managed to finally take out our 15.96 demand. 

I am not sure if you guys caught the opening 30-45 minutes of oddity… on the VIX we were holding near 15.8 area and then on a one minute candle we saw the VIX flush to 15.1 LOD and then in the next 15 minute candle had push and recovered almost a full 10%... it was incredibly odd… 

Again I am not one to call manipulation as I just think 99.99% of the time traders use that as an excuse to why they were wrong instead of just admitting their trade failed… but the fact that we had a 10 point ($1) long 15min DOJI rejection candle on SPY and at the same time the VIX was doing all of its oddity… tells me that something bigger happened behind the scenes. 

That flash down on the VIX was enough to stop the momentum which then led to a full day of consolidation. 

For the time of momentum we carried and just overall selling we saw today (And volume 137% of 30day average) the fact that SPY held inside a $2.5 range for basically the whole day until power hour is incredibly odd… 

Now looking at the VIX daily here (and this is why I love TAing the VIX even though I get a tough of flak for it… but we broke through the critical 14.79 supply area yesterday which unlocked the bear movement for today… now we are back in the incredibly strop 17.2 to 17.91 VIX supply/ resistance area… IF the VIX can push through 17.91 then likely this sell off is just getting started and we could be looking at a sustained downside move to come… However, if this 17.91 supply holds once again (like it did in the middle of August) then likely we have found our temporary bottom and will look for further upside from here… 

Truly all eyes will be on the VIX… close over 17.91 and we start looking for 19.56 which unlocks the ultimate bear pain in the markets. Reject and especially close back under 17.2 supply and we likely found our bottom.

Coming into today I was obviously bearish and I honestly (while it did finally come during PH) I am a bit surprised that we didn’t see a true bear trend day… I was very caught off guard by essentially today from opening until 3pm today being a range day. 

My first short actually hit 7.25 points of profit which is extremely unfortunate because at 7.5 points of profit I lock in a 5 point stop loss… unfortunately that play on a massive reversal candle stopped me out at BE. 

2nd play I was extremely confident in and entered a little early before confirmation (which did come) however then we were chopping and after all of the morning range/ chop I decided to close out at what was support/ demand at that time as with the VIX movement and the fact that big tech like Apple and MSFT were pushing green I was worried about a reversal. 

I hit another great short (basically right after the 2nd short) and at the time sold the bottom. 

From there I waited all day until just before power hour to get into a short again. We were holding at the time 4396 support so well and I had quite seen the confirmation I wanted for further downside that I sold and then of course the bottom absolutely fell out… After that I was pretty much cash gang and just didn’t want to chase or fomo into anything. 

With yesterday being FOMC and an odd/ hard day to trade today was really the first Live forward testing of the updated strategy of sticking with the trend… now it did hit a 100% win rate today which is unlikely to continue and I did come in just under my daily profit goal also. I definitely could have netted far more points today but truly that opening hour volatility/ misdirection and the intraday range till power hour had me thrown off guard and I had no trust in plays anymore. But today netted a great result and I am very happy with how it turned out. 

This was a huge step forward in this strategy/ forward testing as usually and historically range days is the death of this strategy and today we came out on top. ",2023-09-21,29,1

* FOMC Meeting at 2pm, followed by Powell Presser at 2:30 (eastern)
   * Markets pricing nearly no chance of a rate hike and about 35% chance of a hike in November 
   * Interest rate projections, dot plots and more will be a feature of what is expected to be a fairly uneventful 
* UK CPI comes in cooler than expected, now less than 50% chance of rate hike tomorrow (was more than 50% pre-CPI)
* Fedex, KB Home report after the close.   


**Expected Moves into Friday:**

* SPY: 1%
* QQQ: 1.2%
* IWM: 1.2%

SPY 0DTE vol is about 19 into the FOMC meeting, then resets back to about 12 next week, showing that although today is expected to be fairly uneventful, there are some option buyers expecting at least some market reaction to Powell.

**Today's Earnings**

* **FedEx Corporation (FDX) E**xpected Move: **4.40%**
* **KB Home (KBH)** Expected Move: **5.27%**

FedEx reports after the close. Options are pricing in about a 4.4% move. Recent earnings have seen the stock move -3%, +4%, +3% and -3%. So the expected move today is on the high side of the past 4 but the stock has been remarkably consistent in moves on earnings over the past year.

The stock has been calm into the print, with realized vol (how much the stock has actually moved) over the past 30 days just 16. That compares to option vol this week of 82, and 30-day IV of 32. In general, the stock has been less volatile in real life than options have been pricing. For reference, the realized vol over the past year is about 27.

FedEx reports after the close. Options are pricing in about a 4.4% move. Recent earnings have seen the stock move -3%, +4%, +3% and -3%. So the expected move today is on the high side of the past 4 but the stock has been remarkably consistent in moves on earnings over the past year.

The stock has been calm into the print, with realized vol (how much the stock has actually moved) over the past 30 days just 16. That compares to option vol this week of 82, and 30-day IV of 32. In general, the stock has been less volatile in real life than options have been pricing. For reference, the realized vol over the past year is about 27.

QQQM and QQQ have 100% fund overlap but QQQM has a .15% expense ratio and QQQ has .20%. VTI has 19.4% of overlap of VOO but that’s only because VTI has 3,828 holdings and VOO has 509 while both have the same expense ratio of .03%. With this being said, it makes the most sense with my current income to buy QQQM and VTI. By not buying QQQ and VOO, am I missing out on greater future returns?

16a1o35_ZS,ZS,"Expected moves this week, QQQ, SPY post labor day IV crush, ZScaler and Docusign earnings","Option vol got slammed last week into the 3 day weekend. The VIX closed at 13, down from 18 on August 18th while the SPY rallied 4% during that time. Weekly SPY vol really got crushed into the long weekend with at-the-money options in SPY for this next week in single digits. That should pick on the open as market makers reset for the new week. 0DTE options in SPY which had been pricing in 0.6-.07% daily moves were back below 0.5%. Keep an eye on those if IV ticks up from 7 to 10 just after the long weekend.

Despite the uptick in realized vol in the market from the very low levels of the spring grind higher, the SPY has basically remained in about a 6% range since June. The past week's rally put it near the top of that range.

The economic calendar perhaps has bigger news overseas this week than domestically, so those are included below. The earnings calendar is winding down over the next two weeks but this week sees reports from Zscaler and Docusign. Below are this week's expected moves, they are smaller both because its a 4 day week but also as vol got crushed into the long weekend. Those may tick higher on the open:

* **SPY Expected Move: 0.8%**
* **QQQ Expected Move: 1.3%**

Salesforce reports tomorrow after the close. The expected move of 6% is at the lower end of the range of recent reports but more than the actual move on the last report (-5%, +12%, -8%). Options expiring Friday are about 78 IV, with 30-day out options about 39 IV. The stock has been quiet into the report with the past 30-day actual vol just 23 (compared to the past year's actual/realized vol of 36).

Salesforce reports tomorrow after the close. The expected move of 6% is at the lower end of the range of recent reports but more than the actual move on the last report (-5%, +12%, -8%). Options expiring Friday are about 78 IV, with 30-day out options about 39 IV. The stock has been quiet into the report with the past 30-day actual vol just 23 (compared to the past year's actual/realized vol of 36).

15v9esi_QQQ,QQQ,QQQ vs SPY ratio: rollover happening,"This selloff off the most recent top is not broad based. The big tech darlings are leading the decline.

The QQQ and the SPY are equal for the most part except that the QQQ has a higher weighting of tech while the SPY has oil and gas, banks, and various other non tech sectors.

The strongest sector last week was probably oil and gas. Look at XLE, USO, DBC, etc. All were up.

The last time there was a rollover in the QQQ vs SPY ratio was after the August 2022 top. It didn't go back up until after the bottom in December. The one prior to that was the rollover at the end of 2021. 

The entire market is not melting down. The oil and gas sector is bullish. The VIX is tame. Treasury yields are rising. Crypto just tanked. Big tech retail favorites are getting hit. This is more like the beginning of 2022. Not the beginning of 2023. GDP estimates are freaking 5.8% for the 3rd quarter. Headline CPI has bottomed. Energy CPI is going back up.

It seems many Youtubers are still bullish the tech favorites like TSLA and PLTR and buying the dip. Anyone buying up the hated commodity sector?

I think there is a probability that we see a repeat of the market similar to most of 2022. Big tech and crypto weakness while banks and energy do well.",2023-08-19,8,11

15ukr3w_ORCL,ORCL,"Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto","Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.

Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.

A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:

15thcco_QQQ,QQQ,Michael burry SP500/QQQ puts strike price?,"Hi, everyone is talking about Michael Burry buying put options with a notional value of $739 million against the popular Invesco QQQ Trust ETF. Also, it put options with a notional value of $886 million against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.

But no1 seems to write what was the strike price of those puts? So we can see how much % down Burry is betting on,  does anyone know?",2023-08-17,1,7
15t95ao_QQQ,QQQ,QQQ 52w high down nearly 7%; who's been bear mode this whole time and how do you feel?,"Also:

* Are you going to continue to hold your short, why?
* Are you adding more to your short position, why?
* Are you exploring other shorts, which & why?

I'm asking so many questions because you bears are the apparent winners here.

Now I realize that the FED is steamrolling inflation to 2% and they're hell bent on achieving that sooner than later, so companies won't be borrowing at these high costs anymore and growth will slow.

[S&P 500 Earnings by Month](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings/table/by-month) was Dec 2021 @ 216.54 and now it's Mar 2023 @ 177.07 which we haven't seen since Jun 2021 **when QQQ was $358 and now it's $362.52 today.**

So stocks most likely will correct too, I see QQQ going lower to like $330 or even $300 in an over correction.

edit, added source to s&p 500 earnings by month above

update, we're down more today, yet I was downvoted for pointing out that bears are winning lol, perma bulls going to feel more pain",2023-08-17,11,26

15febls_QQQ,QQQ,SCHD vs QQQ Individual Brokerage,"So I recently met with a wealth advisor and they thought I would lose growth with a strategy I’d thought of. I’m curious of others thoughts. After 401k contribution and ROTH max yearly contribution, I buy more in my individual brokerage.

I’m a 29YO M, want kids, and want to retire by 60. I buy VOO and QQQ in my Roth but in my Individual I buy dividend growth funds like SCHD and DGRO because my theory is that once I retire, I’d get obliterated by capital gains tax if I sold QQQ holdings for income from SCHD. I figured why not just buy and hold till I retire, then take the DRIP off. Am I missing something?

My advisor said I’d be missing a lot of growth but I’m thinking how will we know what taxes will look like, and would the gain beat the tax?

Also, I’d like to add that I do buy a few individual plays like AAPL, DELTA, ABBV, etc. in my individual but the totality of those positions combined don’t make 20% of the portfolio.

Thoughts on the strategy?",2023-08-01,11,20

15agz67_META,META,"FOMC Day and META Earnings… 7-26-23 SPY/ ES FUTURES, QQQ and VIX DAILY MARKET ANALYSIS","This is officially without a doubt one of the most boring FOMC days I have ever seen… the initial FOMC rate hike reaction had one of if not the smallest reaction in almost 1.5 years… 

**FOMC**

So lets talk about FOMC… what was said and what can we expect in the future…

(I am going to just copy and past some tweets here for you to read and then I will discuss)

· The Fed raised its funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. The midpoint of this range would be the highest level for the benchmark rate since early 2001.

· Fed Powell: The full effects of tightening are yet to be felt.

· Fed's Powell: We haven't made any decisions about future meetings.

· Powell: Inflation has proven more resilient than expected.

· Powell has said that the staff are no longer forecasting a recession.

· Federal Reserve's Powell has said: I don't see inflation back at 2% until about 2025.

· FOMC: Voted 11-0 For Fed Funds Rate Action 

· FOMC: Economic Activity Has Been Expanding At a Moderate Pace 

· FOMC: Job Gains Have Been Robust in Recent Months, Unemployment Rate Has Remained Low 

· FOMC Will Continue to Assess Additional Information, Implications for Monetary Policy 

· FOMC: Future Actions Depend on Tightening Impact, Economic and Financial Developments

· FED SWAPS CONTINUE PRICING IN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL HIKE

· Analyst: Fed May Consider Another Rate Hike In September, But Will Assess The Impact Of Previous Moves And Inflation Trends Before Making A Decision

· POWELL: FOMC TO TAKE DATA-DEPENDENT APPROACH ON FUTURE HIKES, WILL MAKE DECISIONS MEETING BY MEETING

· POWELL: WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT ANY FUTURE MEETINGS

· Analyst: The Lack Of Changes In The Policy Statement Was A Surprise, And While There Was A Slight Increase In The Hawkish Tone Regarding Economic Growth, The Overall Message Is That The Fed Is Neither Dismissing Nor Confirming The Possibility Of Another Rate Hike.

Overall the message here is about what I expected… I expected JPOw to neither confirm nor deny a further rate hike in September but rather to say that it was data depenedent like usual… honestly much of his speech was about the same as the last 6 meetings… same story different day… a few notable mentions though is that JPOW did say they do not forecast a recession and that they admitted inflation is more resilient than expected. 

It will be interesting to see how markets digest this over night as this was one of the more mild if not the mildest reaction to a FOMC day that I have ever seen. 

**META EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1na8uc90edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9996a49cdceeb3002c7db0c360fbb76e19513d16

As of right now META has a major green reaction… it has as of this writing given back a lot of the green… 

Digging deeper into the earnings looks like a nice revenue and EPS beat… also a bit of a surprising upside beat on active users… as of right now though there is not really enough of a move up though at 5% (as of writing) to beat the implied move… likely calls and puts will lose on this one… it will also be curious to see how markets react on the call… that is where both MSFT and TSLA met their demise. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zipky3p0edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc21ec8afb4badfa6fb2f193aa996436d680080

Overall on Spy this actually was a terribly boring range bound day… prior to actual FOMC minutes we didn’t even break $1.2 for most of the day… in the end though SPY finally broke through this massive wall at $455 that we have been fighting at… however, we were not able to breach and hold over 456.82 supply…. That currently remains our next upside resistance. 

We were extremely close until pretty much the last second of putting a new supply in today… but with that last minute push up we were able to avoid that… We continue to hold the daily ema support also…. With a daily dmi wave up the favor remains to the upside but we are clearly stuck in this range…. I wouldn’t be too aggressive going long until spy closes over 456.82 and I wouldn’t be too eager to short until we close under 452.1. Anything in between is straight consolidation and chop. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 452.1 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/niuyhi61edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4abd4d1b9774c674e464fede21e55085b4541a6

A real tough move on Futures here with the double top but bounce off of the daily 8ema support. We did just barely avoid a daily supply being put in… as of now momentum continues to be to the upside. Our next major resistance will be 4621. Bulls also will need to defend 4595 supply as support or we likely will see a retest of 4563 demand. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply -4596 -> 4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4563 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3bicx1m1edeb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=896021bd8984d1bd6af8c29df803f642e9a39172

This was a bit of a struggle day for QQQ today… we also barely and narrowly EOD survived not putting a new supply in… however we were able to backtest the 376.16 demand and also daily 20ema support and hold those levels…

We continue to see a daily DMI waving up, however, bulls need to retake the daily 8ema resistance tomorrow and also need to close over 379.16 to break this consolidation on QQQ… Likely with the meta beat we could see a nice post-fomc bounce tomorrow on TECH. 

There is quite a bit of support being established here at this 376 level which should lead to further upside from here… 385.73 remains my first upside target with 388.47 and 389.92 as the next major upside target. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.16 -> 400.01

Unsurprisingly the VIX did see a downside move today and did close back under the daily 8ema and also established a new daily supply… we only slightly moved the current 14 supply to 14.02… this 14 level on the VIX has become a solid resistance and rejection area… 

We also interestingly enough closed below the 13.29 and 13.59 demand. Next major support is 12.89 on the VIX… 

The VIX continues to point to further upside or minimally consolidation on the markets.

As a momentum/ breakout trader I have got to say this… these last 3 days of trading have pretty much been my worst case scenario… absolutely no continuation, no breakouts and just overall terrible technicals for entries. Not only that when we finally do get a solid A+ set up we are left with such tiny range and movements that we don’t even receive a proper payout. 

I am hoping regardless of what way the markets choose to go that they chose to go that way in a decently big way… ",2023-07-26,12,1

Google with a massive and impressive beat here… Overall google calls are going to absolutely print. With a big beat here on Google it will be interesting to see if this is the boost that tech needed. 

**FOMC**

As of right now it is a 98.9% odds that we get a 25bps rate hike tomorrow… so it is safe to say that we with certainty will get a 25bps hike tomorrow as the market is expecting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pjlvetqva6eb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef46e9f47ecd5f563d813202d1754f0efe81b30f

Now what really matters is what JPOW has to say for next FOMC meeting in September. Now keep in mind these few things… we KNOW as of right now according to Cleveland fed nowcast that inflation next month will increase… now the question and what we don’t know as of right now is that a one off rebound or is this the bottom for a long time? 

My thoughts are that JPOW gives the same old same old speech about being data dependent and that we are likely to have a “live” September meeting. If JPOW leaves it that way and also reassures us that banks are strong and what not (basically the same old same old) I believe we see a rally post FOMC. However, if JPOW even hints at having thought about a 50bps or comes in hawkish on next meeting with inflation then we could see a pretty bearish reaction to this data. 

I think markets will continue to front run tomorrows fomc as the last hike for a long time.

After we put a new demand in yesterday we finally are seeing our breakout from the 452.1 to 454.21 consolidation. That would favor that this is the start of a run up. Now of course we have FOMC tomorrow and that could be a bit of a game changer depending on what JPOW has to say… but as of now I am expecting a breakout. 

It is notable that SPY did fail to break through 456.82 supply. That is our next major resistance to break through and close over… if we do then our next target is 461.48 and then 466.05. I am bullish on SPY currently with 460+ being my ultimate target. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48

Much like SPY we have a new daily demand yesterday on futures and we did finally break out of this 4595 to 4563 consolidation. With this breakout, bounce off daily 8ema support, extreme bull momentum on weekly and daily with a daily DMI move up… I am bullish and I do expect us to continue to push to the 4600+ area into next week. 

Next key resistance and level to watch is 4621.

Tech attempted to show some bullish strength today but actually end up showing slight weakness EOD. Now with a big google beat and depending on what MSFT does after hours we could finally see a huge move up on the Qs tomorrow and into the EOW. 

We did finally also get our new daily demand put in at 376.29 on Q today… This then gives us an upside target of 385.73… but my ultimate target for the EOW is 388.47 to 389.92. 

After we break out and close over 389.92 my ultimate target is 400-401.83. 

We also have a daily DMI Wave up starting on QQQ which supports further upside. 

As long as bulls continue to defend 376.29 I only see consolidation and/ or upside. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.29 -> 400.01

The VIX once again attempted to push up here. However, today we actually saw the VIX despite holding green almost all day close red. We did once again fail to close over the daily 20ema and over the supply level at 14. 

The VIX likely will see a sell off tomorrow post fomc which should give us a new supply off todays candle high at 14.03… that would also break this red bull channel on the VIX and should also give spy/ qqq further upside.

Today was another boring day of trading for me. I got stopped out on a call as you see this morning and then I took another call around noon that end up being stopped out at breakeven. After that I honestly never saw anything that looked suitable for entry. 

Today we ended up moving up purely on momentum. However, this was not quite the strong momentum we are used to on trend days… if you step back and look at it on SPY and QQQ really until just before power hour we held a bull trend day… 

Now the issue is that ever retest of support on the 15min 5ema really looked like the next leg down… however, that became the buy the dip opportunity and led to further upside… if you trade based strictly on the fact the 15min 5ema was going to hold support and not fail no matter what then you likely did well today… but for me I never saw an A+ setup and the few plays that were B setups that I watched barely netted 5% profits on 1dte due to the fact that we held a pretty tight range most of the day. 

I am looking forward to FOMC tomorrow hopefully giving the markets a reason to pick a direction and push that way. ",2023-07-25,9,0

14tac6o_QQQ,QQQ,I locked myself in a box spread and levered myself at 3.33x on SPY/QQQ,"As if the story of 1RONYMAN was a tale of caution...

Two days ago, I was having some real FOMO on the bull market. I've been holding 2x ETFs ($SSO/$QLD) since the start of the 2023 bull run, but somehow I decided that this wasn't sufficient leverage for my personal risk tolerance.

I've been fucking around looking for arbitrage opportunities lately, and the idea of a box spread intrigued me. If I sell a call credit spread and put credit spread that cancel each other out, I can effectively get interest-free margin, right?

I ventured into the SPY options chain for Dec 2025 to see if I could get a perfect fill on these spreads. To my surprise, I could. I was able to get a $500 credit for selling a 490/495 put credit (for $166) spread alongside a 495/500 call credit spread (for $334) -- meaning a net loss of 0 at expiration.

I started small, but when I made the first trade, my account value went up immediately. Due to the wide bid-ask spreads on the options and my ""risk-free"" order fill, Thinkorswim considered the position to be of positive value, even though it was actually 0.

Number go up. Ape brain kicks in. Free money. Unga bunga.

So, I got a little carried away and maxed out my margin such that I opened up a box spread credit to the tune of $40,000. I then used that pile of money to buy a bunch of shares of 2x bull ETFs. With my own capital included, this puts me in a position of $100k worth of $SSO and $QLD. In other words, 1.66x leverage on a 2x ETF which means a 3.33x levered position on SPY/QQQ, compounded daily.

I then thought back to the tale of 1RONYMAN and considered the risk of early assignment. If SPY tanks, then my short 495 puts will have no extrinsic value left, and it's possible I get assigned early. This means I'll have to exercise my 490 puts, meaning I lose $40,000 in cash. In order to get the cash back, I'll need to sell back my 2x shares at a hefty loss. But also, this means my call credit spread will be left exposed by itself, meaning I'll have to sell even more shares low to buy that back too (but in theory, at least I should be able to buy it back at a lower price than what I sold it at).

Having considered this risk, I decided to see if I'd be able to close my box spread for the same price at which I opened it ($500 per spread). I cannot. The limit order isn't getting filled at $5.00. And I have no idea what price at which I could get the order filled. The natural price is $13.00, but that would mean I be buying the $40,000 loan back for $104,000, meaning a $64,000 loss. So it looks like I'm forced to keep the box spread open until Dec 2025, at which point I'll still be debited $40,000, but hopefully stocks will have gone up a lot by then.

Yesterday, I received my first margin call when SPY dipped a bit. I deposited more cash to cover it. That's the other thing. Even though I bought the shares using ""my own"" money from opening the box spread, TD Ameritrade still considers my position to be on margin. So now, in addition to early assignment risk, I get to worry about margin calls for the next 2.5 years.

Anyway, SPY to the moon.

The biggest thing we have next week is CPI on Wednesday, PPI on Thursday and then U of M consumer sentiment Friday… Monday and Tuesday likely wont be too bad but Wednesday Thursday and Friday definitely have some market moving data potential.

Until the EOD dump here we had looked extremely strong and we were set up to make a new daily demand… however, that incredible sell off completely negated all that… we still have a daily DMI waving down and still have not put a new demand in… 

Favor remains to the downside until that changes… 431.37 is the next demand and our target until a new demand is put in.

This is just an incredible upside wick and rejection… back to back long wicked dojis in opposite directions on the daily… This daily candle here makes it hard not to feel bearish for Monday… We did just close our 3rd red day in a row also…

Honestly that intraday double reversal is something I haven’t really seen since spring of 2022… that was truly impressive and mind boggling… The upside V bottom reversal is just classic and pretty much to be expected every single day… but seeing that happen then immediately reverse and dump… that is a huge surprise and unique. 

Now we do have a nice black bear channel forming here on Spy… As of now 435.8 is support and 442 is resistance for the Monday for that channel.  

With the rejection and wick back under the daily 8ema I have to favor a retest of the daily 20ema at this point which also sits right at 435.85… 

As bearish as this EOD dump was the last 6 months basically have been a buy the dip type of moment… its still pretty hard to wanna feel long term bearish.

IF you are bearish then you will like the weekly here on SPY… so far we put in a new 443.42 supply after putting in the demand last week… we also are in the middle of a DMI wave down… the weekly continues to set up bearishly here. 433.04 demand is our next target. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0jfqaksm6mab1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=017590b40071243f737b2eb56d9583c1b65b5a18

Relatively speaking the weekly chart continues to look bullish… as you can see since March we have continued to just rise relentlessly. 

We continue to ride over the weekly 8ema and also continue to ride in the blue bull channel. The weekly would appear that this drop is just a temporary set back in a longer bull trend. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.42 -> 430.01 -> 427.35  
 Demand- 433.04 -> 411.57  
 Support- 437.6 -> 432.6 -> 427.1  
 Resistance- 443.6 -> 453.4

Same story here on futes there is no new daily demand. However, the daily DMI actually is fully oversold now. Ease of momentum remains bearish and next target is 4374. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vmblwnn6mab1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd68e1bf0613864f8ec2b8a6c63764031fc56772

Futures daily also has a pretty solid and bearish rejection with that long wick and back to back closures under the daily 8ema. 

The black bear channel support sits at 4404 which is where the daily 20ema will sit and resistance is 4468.

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

Much like SPY weekly we are seeing a new weekly supply put in at 4483 which would effectively take out 4460 supply also. 

Our daily DMI remains waving down which should without a new demand leave the ease of momentum downward and our target would be 4389. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/81vbn4fo6mab1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8686a6b97f3d07fe76d2b891180233ca65b0a16

Much like SPY weekly overall trend remains upward… however, futes do have a weekly double top… I would start to consider a weekly 8ema retest of support which would be near 4388 next week. 

Overall we remain in an upward trend and if you buy enough time the dips for now are buying opportunities.. IF we close under the weekly 8ema I will start to consider a change of trend. 

FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4483 -> 4461 -> 4284  
 Demand- 4389  
 Support- 4388 -> 4348  
 Resistance- 4485 -> 4542

The Qs looked so strong today also until that impressive eod dump.. we now have for the 6th time rejected and failed to close over the 370.39 to 371.41 supply… this now should be considered major resistance and until we close and hold over that I would be very hesitant to go long… 

There is no new daily demand and daily DMI continues to wave down.. ease of momentum remains down with next key support at 357.09 and 357.6. 

**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4caqecbp6mab1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2049737a40649cca47c65f59b919d1902669e5ad

Well after the 362.67 demand was put in last week we are actually turning around and immediately putting in a new supply at 369.57… that effectively with a weekly DMI wave down would make our target the 362.67 demand… 

QQQ weekly much like SPYs overall remains extremely bullish. I would hesitate to be too short on QQQ until we close under the weekly 8ema. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 369.57 -> 354.65  
 Demand- 382.9 -> 362.67 -> 322.47

Now if the fact that SPY and QQQ were able to rip $4 and then drop $4 wasn’t wild enough to you…. How about the fact that we did it without VOLD/ VOLSPD supporting that (meaning we didn’t really have tons of selling) and the VIX was not in support of that.. we had an almost 4% drop on the VIX and SPY closed red with it… 

Now we DID get a new daily supply on VIX which is what I was anticipating at 15.44. This means that supply a 15.01 and 14.51 are taken out… we did not quite come down low enough to hit the 14.1 supply though to take that out. 

We also broke the short term bull channel on the VIX in white… so the VIX would actually make one assume we are more bullish than we actually are… so the question remains who is right and who is wrong? 

Who is being trapped here… are the bulls being trapped or are the bears being trapped? Honestly I think the case for both is strong. I would have anticipated with a 2% drop in CPI expected on Wednesday that markets would front run the bullishness of that… however it would appear the markets wanted to be risk off going into next week.

Well I was able to barely squeak out my third green day in a row which is a nice recovery from the last few weeks of woes… however, I still put in a pretty read week and overall my win rate is extremely sub par of where it should be… 

However, I honestly feel like I learned quite a bit today and this week and this is what I learned and would like to see improve next week…

I experimented with my stops going down to -5% or -7% but honestly it just is far too choppy out here on SPY and QQQ to do that… so I will go back to my standard -10% stop loss next week. 

I really enjoy the 3rd expiration dte for the overall movement but the market honestly remains far too choppy and stop loss hunty for me to stay with a 3dte… I will be moving up to a 4dte next week. The biggest thing that burnt me today and really yesterday was stop loss hunts.. I was pretty much almost always accurate (within an acceptable rate) on the direction that SPY/ QQQ was going to go… however I was not able to weather the stop loss hunts before the move happened… 

Overall my upside and downside levels were pretty much perfect. I believe with a 4th dte expiration and 10% stop loss I will be able to weather the storm of stop loss hunts and should be able to see far more wins… I would say 50% of my losses were stop loss hunts not actually picking the wrong overall direction. 

I also experimented trading Spy and QQQ together at the same time… what I learned is obviously QQQ gave me a far better win rate… I did notice a lot too that SPY and QQQ would not go anywhere without eachother… for instance today on the massive move up QQQ was a huge laggard when spy broke out and continued to break out… QQQ then caught up with spy… yesterday QQQ was the leader and SPY caught up with it… 

The best way and how I will approach this next week is to analyze like I did the last two days SPY and QQQ… at the time where I see an entry I will be analyzing which has the highest potential for profits at that moment… meaning if SPY leads the push and QQQ is getting ready then I take QQQ… 

Overall still a red week but a better week mentally and results wise… less red too… Really Monday is what did me in… next week is a full trading week finally and I look forward to a much better trading week… ",2023-07-07,16,50

14s8h0q_PFE,PFE,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

14s8h0q_LUV,LUV,"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more","Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

**Chart of the Day:**

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

14raa25_RIVN,RIVN,"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.","Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day). Options are pricing just a 10% move for the rest of the month, a potential disconnect between realized and implied.

14raa25_DAL,DAL,"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.","Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

14pix8k_OKTA,OKTA,"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.","Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.

14pix8k_TGT,TGT,"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.","Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.

14pix8k_NKE,NKE,"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.","Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.

14mysv9_KO,KO,"Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ","Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.

14m299g_DAL,DAL,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14m299g_JNJ,JNJ,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14m299g_MS,MS,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14m299g_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ","Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

14l8kq8_UAL,UAL,"Expected moves today: SPY, QQQ, Micron and more.","As market participants await words from Jay Powell, stock futures have slipped slightly into the red with tech pulling back from its recent rally. Chip stocks like Nvidia are leading the way lower following a report in the WSJ that the U.S. is considering restricting AI-focused chips from being exported to China. Powell's remarks will be interesting considering the economic data of late like consumer confidence and housing starts showing the economy still plugging away. He is speaking at an ECB / Central banker gathering with Christine Lagarde also appearing. The 1-year treasury is around 5.30, higher than before the SVB mess, and the 2-year yield is 4.74, still below its pre-SVB peak but has been moving towards those levels.

The VIX remains below 14 with SPY at the money vol about 11.

On the earnings front Micron (MU) is set to update today, with Nike reporting tomorrow.

14kizmd_QQQ,QQQ,"MXWEX, PRWCX, or put money towards my personal roth into QQQ / VTI split?","Hi All, Well so currently I am investing in 3 ways, one with a company pers, two company 457 deferred compensation at $195.20 a month, and lastly i am taking $100 a month and putting in my personal roth.. I am thinking at this point the 457 deferred is not cutting it..   
all of it is going into a fund MXWEX and the return has been roughly 5% thus far.   
it looks like i have the ability to re-balance into PRWCX Fund which seems to have done way better overall vs MXWEX. Or the other thought was to stop making contributions to the 457 and take that money and put into personal roth..  
the only diff i see is roth is post tax, and this fund is pre-tax i think.

any tips / ideas?

Thanks all!",2023-06-27,0,1
14kq0qp_TM,TM,"Are the bulls back in control? 6-27-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","Reminder- I am leaving outta town tomorrow morning and wont be back till Sunday… no TA until Monday. I will be back trading full time Monday (don’t forget that’s a half day and markets closed tueday). 

Well this was officially the strongest bull and trend day we have had since June 1st… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7x1frk9com8b1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1351bb3e527b16b8daf37b8768bd7966200e3e

Remember JPOW is scheduled to speak tomorrow at 930am. From what I am seeing it is a panel like meeting and there should be questions… not really sure much other than that. It will be interesting to see how markets react this time as last week they did not take anything he had to say too hot… nor was pre market. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h48bklpcom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=be530f12d327204ee51a9d3b1129cbadad263e5e

Well it officially happened! We officially got a new daily demand at 431.37 and we also started our daily DMI wave up. 

Now we did not quite touch 430 nor touch the daily 20ema like I was hoping for… but this looks like a very convincible v bottom before we start our next leg up… 

As you can see we came close to 436.95 but did not quite hit it today to take that level out… 

Our upside target will be 442.55 and 445.34 this week IF bulls can punch through 436.95 and defend the daily 8ema tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ruc3c25dom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbe5e19507ef71653b7c203eed6746e04b7df50

We now have a clear uptrend here and have clearly broken the red bear channel that started back on June 16th. As of now unless tomorrow we immediately drop and close back under the daily 8ema my expectation is a continuation upward. 

I actually was extremely tempted to open some Friday DTE calls for my vaca with a target of 445 (or even next Friday DTE) but with JPOW tomorrow morning I decided that wasn’t a smart idea. No reason to risk markets negatively reacting to JPOW. 

This backtest of support here really could be the pullback that bulls needed to push us to that magical 450 number… 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 442.55 -> 445.34  
 Demand- 436.95 -> 431.37  
 Support- 432.3 -> 431.4 -> 429.7  
 Resistance- 436.3 -> 439.4 -> 442.8

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Futures also finally got a new daily demand… this one came just about 100 pts higher than the previous… seems about every 80-100 pts we do establish a new daily demand. 

With this nice double bottom, daily demand, DMI wave up and recovery over the daily 8ema our expectation should be continuation to the upside… our major target will be 4467 to 4472. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/slfr5k1eom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d51f62c8547ace757a301791e4491ee4384b726

Futures also broke the daily red bear channel and now finds itself in an uptrend… while we again did not touch the daily 20ema like I would have liked and I really would have liked to see that contract roll gap down to 4300 filled… this is a pretty bullish potential start of a v bottom. 

Bulls need to now punch through 4427 which as you can see is a pretty strong resistance and is also just about where futures stopped its run today. IF bulls close over and push through 4427 then I do like our upside target to be 4467-4472 by the EOW. 

However, if we negatively react to JPOW tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema to close… then likely we will see that 4341 to 4351 support area retested. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4472 -> 4467 -> 4312  
 Demand- 4375 -> 4537  
 Support- 4375 -> 4351  
 Resistance- 4415 -> 4427 -> 4469

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2btnbiheom8b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b30c5196f550b7e2062ab887848c6634c49de9

Now here on QQQ we also started a new daily demand today at 357.6. We did not end up coming down low enough to actually touch the daily 20ema now did we come low enough to take out the 357.09 supply. However with this new higher demand and recovery over the daily 8ema we should start to put 370.39 and 371.41 back into our playbook. 

The one difference here on QQQ vs. SPY/ES is that we did not start a daily DMI wave up. That could suggest that this is once again a dead cat bounce. 

With the breakout of the red bear channel though that does suggest an upside push and does also establish a new possible yellow bull channel as you can see. 

My upside still remains 370-371 and then if we can really break out 377-380.

However, if this much like last Thursday is just a big dead cat bounce and a bull trap… then we will once again set our sights on 357.09 and 354.95. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 371.41 -> 370.39 -> 357.09 -> 354.95  
 Demand- 357.6 -> 380.1

**VIX**

The VIX much like QQQ does have me a little hesitant on going straight bull… mostly because we have not seen a new daily supply put in on the VIX… as you can see we did touch, reject and close below the 14.51 supply and closed back under the daily 20/8ema today… however, until we really get the daily supply as further confirmation of downside on the VIX with the daily demand on SPY/ QQQ it is still slightly speculative. 

If we see a red day tomorrow on the VIX we likely will get a new supply at 14.13 which then sets our targets once again on the 12.89 area for the VIX and possibly even lower before we bounce and find a new demand. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

No trades today for me…

I tossed around what I wanted to do a lot last night… I had considered trading QQQ today but I ultimately decided against that because I hadn’t had time to fully backtest my strategy on QQQ. 

What I ended up doing today is I basically took a research day… instead of actually entering trades I really just analyzed SPY all day and its technicals and then took some “phantom” trades… so basically watching premiums to see if I had entered at $XYZ would it have been profitable or not…

Scalp wise in the end I would have still had a down day (granted small and I had much better success than the last few weeks). I am fully on board with putting my scalp strategy on the back burner for a while… my goal is to still watch for “perfect” scalp entries and when I see that the plays I am watching become more profitable and successful than not (like now) I will bring it back into the rotation. 

I went back to my OG level to level trade strategy that I used a lot end of 2022 and beginning of 2023. I was going to just start right back up real trading this but it had been a long time since I was able to do this and I wanted to see how premiums moved… I started out on 5dte and eventually moved down to 3dte… 3dte does seem like a really nice sweet spot for these… 

The biggest things I learned here today which will make this strategy that much more better next week when im back trading full time is that 1. Do not fight momentum (scalping is different as you can quick hit a scalp with a reversion to mean against momentum)… 2. The 15min trend with the assistance of the 5min trend is what I need to listen to… wait for confirmation and do not let the 5min trend head fake you (I had a morning put that the 15min said to hold and was golden but the 5min bull trapped me… sold a “-5% loss” only for it to then go on to be 15% “profits.”) and 3. Trust my targets… this is a big different here between scalps and l2l… scalps yeah I have an upside or downside target but mostly sell early because of theta and premiums being crushed… with these l2l I have to really trust my upside targets… set a breakeven stop once I see some profits and just continue to move that stop up until I hit the next target. 

Overall I am mentally ready for a nice VACA with family and some time away from the markets… but I look forward to next week already. 

Enjoy the rest of the week trading… remember capital preservation and risk management is the key to success! ",2023-06-27,4,0
14jed4y_NKE,NKE,"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.","SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.

14jed4y_JNJ,JNJ,"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.","SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.

14jexpt_QQQ,QQQ,How reasonable/good is to go VOO/QQQ/SCHD?,"Hey, so as my title says I was wondering to invest some money monthly from my paycheck into these three etfs.   


I was thinking of doing 50% VOO, 25% QQQ, 25% SCHD.  


I think I would like it to sit there for at least 10years+, but maybe I would also like to be able to use some of those money sooner if that makes sense. Is this a good split or should i maybe go for something else as I am kinda new to those things, but if my math is correct the VOO by itself should do 11.75% yearly but if i combine those three it should do 13.3%.  


Thank you for any suggestions!",2023-06-26,53,63
14g3dsd_FDX,FDX,"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.","Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

I do this post every morning as sort of a daily trading arsenal and figured I'd share it here rather than just a weekly post. Do you all enjoy it? Is there something else you'd like me to include? Let me know in the comments. Even the haters and losers :-)

14g3dsd_BA,BA,"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.","Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

14g3dsd_SNOW,SNOW,"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.","Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

I did come in pretty spot on for my numbers… but honestly even if the fed pauses tomorrow or “skips” I think its dangerous for them to pause when CORE YoY is still as hot as it is…

Well I said yesterday we did not have any sort of notice from Fed whisperer NICK… but it would appear our boi has finally signaled that the fed indeed will pause tomorrow… 

Now do I think the fed should do a 25bps cause of CORE? Absolutely… but at this point really no reason to expect a surprise at this point…

I showed you guys a very similar chart last night for CPI day… IF you had swung SPY calls it was about a 30-40% win and QQQ calls were about a 40-50% win… now I did NOT swing anything myself as I just don’t think the risk to reward is there… but the odds of a red open tomorrow are pretty solid…

The last few fed meetings has seen a pretty dramatic drop EOD… actually this is super interesting as it plays out perfectly to what FOMCs have always did….   
 

sell off 2pm to 230pm -> 230 to 245/3pm pump -> 245/3pm to EOD dump… shall we see a repeat?

Spy continues to pump and actually did close out an abandoned baby pattern here… however, we did fail to reach the daily demand at 437.87…. this remains our upside target for tomorrow. 

If we break through 437.87 I don’t have any levels until $445 area. 

However, on a red day tomorrow there actually is a pretty strong chance that bears will put in a supply off todays candle at 436.69. That would in my opinion lead to a sell off Thursday back to 429.86.

SPY remains in this upward black bull channel and now is coming in on the blue bull channel resistance tomorrow also…

Black resistance sits at 439.7 and blue sits at 440.

Now we are getting pretty over extended from the daily 8ema here and a pullback is become more and more probable…. 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised regardless of what happens tomorrow with FOMC to see a decently red open Thursday and a decent pullback… SPY actually closed its 4th green day in a row which is something that has not happened since end of march/ beginning of April. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 428.06 -> 429.13   
 Demand- 429.86 -> 437.87

Taking a look at QQQ today we finally hit my upside bull target of 361.7 and have officially taken that very old demand out… from here our next upside target realistically is the 369.32 to 371.41 supplies. 

If we find a big bounce up tomorrow our target should be 369.32. However, with daily DMI completed to the upside and rejecting the red bull channel resistance we could actually look for a retrace to back test support at 360.5 and 357.09. 

Depending on what happens tomorrow QQQ is set up to put in a new daily supply (resistance) off this daily candle at 363.26… that would open up the opportunity to come back and test 357.09 and 354.95 to take out those supplies and retest the daily 8ema before putting in a new demand (Support)… 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32 -> 371.41  
 Demand- 349.06 -> 347.93

Now on the daily VIX here we did close out a nice double top and rejection off the daily 8ema at exactly 15. 

If the VIX was to fall tomorrow we most probably would put in a new daily supply at 15… which would open up an opportunity for the VIX to drop back to that 13.62 demand…

I have a theory and its complete tinfoil permabull fuel type of stuff…. I was thinking about it and clearly market wants to go up and clearly its not sensible long term to fight this bull trend… so I was thinking the fact that the VIX was at precovid lows and back in the 13s really made it difficult for the VIX to go much lower which really makes it difficult for SPY to go much higher… what if with CPI and FOMC back to back and a nice pump on the VIX… that this is the vehicle SPY needed to pump to 440-450 now…

Think about it… SPY loves to unwind with the VIX and despite an 8% pump yesterday SPY did not drop lower… what if not when the VIX unwinds back to the low to mid 13s SPY finally has the momentum to push this to that 450 area? 

Just a thought… 

However then I take a look at the FG index and I see it sitting at 80… the 2nd highest level its been in the last year… Actually since July 2021… the FG index has only seen 80 or higher two times now. 

Lets take a look at that once again…

November 9th 2021 the FG hit 77 and SPX was $4685… SPX then fell to a low of $4513 and an FG index of 25 on December 1st. That would be a 3.8% drop. 

December 1st 2022 the FG hit 76 and SPX was $4077… SPX then fell to a low of $3850 and an FG index of 37 on December 29th 2022… That would be a 5.9% drop.

February 1st 2023 the FG index hit 82 (the highest level in the last 2 years) and SPX was $4119… SPX then fell to a low of $3856 and FG index hit 23 on March 13th 2022… that would be a 6.8% drop.

So on average over the last two years when the FG index has peaked at these levels… SPX has seen a 5.5% drop over 19 trading days… 

That COULD mean if we are peaking here at FG 79 and SPX $4369 then we COULD see a drop to $4128 or SPY $412.5 by July 12th… However, if SPY pumps to $440 tomorrow that could look more like SPY $416… 

This all plays into my theory that tomorrow FOMC will be a local top and Thursday minimally (perhaps Friday) could be a juicy retrace…

(note that last call on SPX was a 1dte not sure why it says 2 thats an error)

I am actually incredibly pleased with myself today and my trading results… I pretty much went into today thinking that “this retrace is an opportunity to go long on a call” now of course I took some puts and I did win nicely on some of those puts… today was low % win types of day because 0dte premiums were so high in the AM and then when you switch to 1dte your premiums are so juicy you don’t see much of a win… 

Overall though a great day of trading where I was able to make up all of yesterdays losses and then some… 

I have said it before and ill say it again… risk management is the key to success and profitability… Yesterday I struggled for sure and had a red day… however, I was able to successfully manage and mitigate those losses to the point where one trading day got me back to green and back up over my daily profit goal (if you subtracted yesterdays losses from todays wins). 

I look forward to trading tomorrow and some of the volatility that will follow with that!",2023-06-13,181,171

There has been a lot of movement today also without any technical support or even worse against technicals…

What do I find very interesting about this here? Well AAPL, MSFT, GOOG/GOOGL, META, QQQ, and NFLX all just hit 52 week highs today… why is that important? Well as much as people want to believe there is a new bull run about to begin… when half of big tech (if not more) are at their 52 week highs and some of them are at their ATHs… you have a lot of convincing to make people buy something like that at ATHs/ 52 week highs… 

Low volume is starting to become a theme here… actually this mornings opening candle was barely 2.3 mil and opening hour total (which includes premarket) barely had 10mil total volume… that is an extreme anomaly….

SPY came within a few pennies today of putting in a new supply… however, it ended up not doing that. As of right now SPY is set up after the really nice rejection at 429.68 to put in a new supply tomorrow at 428.32…

Presumably Spy will have a red day tomorrow which then establishes that supply… with the DMI on the daily overbought its perfect conditions to wave down… in doing so our target will 100% be 422.04 supply… IF we lose that then we could look for a new demand to be established in the 414.55 to 422.04 area… 

Current trend we have been in is we put a topping candle like this in followed by 1-2 days of selling before a new demand is established which then leads to a new high…

Now I REALLY struggled not taking a SPY put overnight… and I partially still wish I did… however, we have a PERFECT evening doji star pattern starting here… which means tomorrow should be a red day and we very well could look for 424.44. 

Note- the reason I don’t wanna take a swing put is my general rules of not taking swings anymore due to my history with them… I am a MUCH better day trader than swing trader for sure… 

We have the gap from Friday that needs to be filled still at 422.92 to 423.95… this would perfectly be filled with a retrace to the daily supply at 422.04. This also would be a great daily 8ema bounce.

 Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2

ES here could if we see a decent drop into the 5pm close still put the daily supply in but as of right now it is not set up to do so… however, as soon as this daily candle for tomorrow opens we should see it signal a perfect supply here at 4288. 

This means our new target will be 4240 on a sell off.

Honestly looking at futes is very hard not to be bearish for tomorrow… this is a textbook bearish reversal pattern with this daily double top with doji off 4288… 

Now there is a SLIGHT chance we could see an immediate turn around into a double bottom off 4282… however, that would require some extreme buying to come in and I don’t really expect that overnight… 

As of right now though keep in mind with both spy and ES in extreme bull momentum any sort of sell off should bounce off the daily 8ema if not the daily 20ema which then becomes a buying opportunity… this should be seen as an opportunity to go long once we find support…

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4240 -> 4312

Now I actually am far more bearish on QQQ and I honestly was going to take a swing put (354P) but I ended up not taking one… mostly trying to obey my rules of no swings… 

But we did actually get a new supply here on QQQ at 354.95 which means our first target is 352.8 and then we would start to target 347.93 demand. I would not be surprised to see a drop and a new demand (support) put in somewhere near 350 if this trend is to hold that we have bene in for almost a month now…

Now the one little hesitation I have on being bearish overnight is that the VIX did not really bounce that much… now last week I did say the first step to a retrace was VIX putting in a new higher close… which we did get today… however if you see I did not put any new levels below 15.78… why? Well because I actually am using the same indicator that I use to make supply and demand (also using this for entries and exits… it was on fire today) and that indicator actually hasn’t put a new demand (support) in on the VIX… 

But why does this matter? I thought you cant TA the VIX? Well you can actually… if you look at all my levels those are all supplies and demands on the VIX… Actually if we played the VIX as a strictly supply/ demand movement it would look like this…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3ej1e4nh94b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=39667ee1ec1dd0d69af675f0c848010a53429851

So what do you see? Well you see that we last put in a supply at 19.56 on 5/25/23 and since then we have not put a new demand (Support) in yet.. now why does that matter? Because until the VIX bounces SPY will not see a sustained sell off… 

Now from here the way im seeing this daily on SPY/ Futures and VIX set up is that we are going to get the new daily supply on futures/ SPY tomorrow and also a new daily demand on VIX at 14.73… that means our target is 16.06 on the VIX and from there we will look to make a bigger move up (if the sell off continues) into the 18-20 range to establish the next supply… 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

I was excited after the weekend for a nice trading day but man I will say almost instantly after we opened today the way the price action was moving on SPY I just new something was off… I was super happy to just sit cash this morning as I have too many times been the victim of these weird movements on SPY and I know that eventually even if the morning is funky that we will settle into some solid technicals…

I was very patient today and actually only took 9 total trades today and the first 8 trades of the day were green… 

8 green trades in a row is my longest streak since May 10th which was 12 green trades in a row… I regrettably took a trade during PH and I know I shoulda just sat it out as my success during PH is very hit or miss.

Overall finishing the day already over 50% of the way to my weekly goal (I have a very arbitrary and loose daily goal of $500 and weekly goal of $2000)…

IT means while yes I do think at this rate the VIX could see 12-13 and SPY could see 430-440… at this point counting on this rally to continue feels like pure FOMO, however, counting on this rally to come to a dramatic end feels like straight YOLO… 

Another thing here is that while I do think the upside is the ease of momentum right now… the odds we wake up to a bank collapsing or some other black swan event seemingly is increasing as time goes on… this honestly is the worst place the markets could be right now…

The question I hate to be asking myself once again is “What is going to stop this rally?” I feel like for months now we get to these “ideal scenarios” that will finally put the market in its place and take it down etc. etc. and then the market just barely makes it by everytime… The way this thing is shaping up is that this truly is going to be a “this time is different” market recovery from bear market to bull market… OR we are just setting ourselves up for one of the biggest and most unexpected crashes this market has seen…

What is the one thing the fed wants but wont directly say they want? That would be higher unemployment rate… this mornings 3.7% UE is the highest reading since December 2022. However, since March 2022 (over a year now) we have NOT gotten a single UE reading over 3.7%.... it seems that the UE hits that level (4 times now over the last 1+ year) and then immediately retraces…

With the highest UE you would have expected the odds of a pause in June to nearly hit 80-90%... however, we are actually seeing a slight pullback here on the odds and now are looking only at a 70.1% chance of a pause in June… 

However, of course market is rallying like a pause and rate cuts have already happened.

In the screenshot above you will see the breadth of S&P500, NASDAQ and NYSE… what does this show? Well in simple terms this shows the buying/ selling pressure of the market… 0 is neutral… what is very interesting to me here is that this is now the second day in a row that the NASD has lagged SPY and NYSE in the buying pressure… what does that mean? Well it means that for the last two days this rally was not led by TECH like previously… 

This is very evident by the heatchart here (taken near EOD)… what does it show? IT shows outside of communication services (which BTW took a big hit due to the amazon news as a whole) that TECH was the WEAKEST member today… this is a big deal… now there are two possibilities here… Market is rotating out of tech and into more small/ mid caps and going risk on because they truly believe the upside is the only way…. However, on the hand this could show that big money finally is slowing down here… I wish I had a way to show you guys for sure but the data im seeing is that the last few days has been heavily retail driven and not big money driven…

Almost exactly two months ago we were post JPM collar roll and I mentioned the history of Futes hitting the sold call level of the collar (or within at least 100 pts of it)… very rarely do we completely pass it but it is possible… my timing assumed we would hit it the 7th week of the trend but it would appear that we are doing it at week 9… 

Now the true question is…. Will this pullback like it historically has after reaching the sold call level of the collar leading into the rotation of the collar (June 30th)?

I very rarely show a 15min intraday chart nor do I include it here but I think its worth it today… why? Well if you look at this chart today I would say that from 1030 until 1115am that was the ONLY time that SPY was easily tradeable today… the opening hour was extremely volatile and unforgiven… I attempted numerous times to catch plays on the way up and down and was not able to get in because SPX premiums were moving $2 in one second… just incredible movement…

If you trusted the extreme momentum of 1030 to 1115am you made some money… From there honestly I can whole heartedly say that from 1115am until EOD it was nothing but bull and bear traps… I haven’t seen so many bear traps in one day… I have never ever seen so many technicals are one time pointing to a put play only for the market to continue to push higher… just absolutely incredible movement on the markets today… This was a clear trend day as evidence by not touching or closing under 20ema all day besides one fast wick during opening hour… however, this was one of the choppiest extreme momentum days ive seen in a while…

From the daily supply and demand here we did not do anything new… we did attempt to touch 429.68 supply and id fall just short of it… this gap up has us sitting between 422.04 and 429.68 supply. 

We did however get a fake wave down (half wave) on the DMI and now the DMI is waving bullishly.

From a weekly stand point here we were attempting to make a new supply up until Thursday when we rallied. However, the two day pump has put us once again with no new supply and with a weekly DMI that is overbought and with a weekly chart in extreme bull momentum. 

With a closure over 427.35 weekly supply we honestly have a huge gap to our next major level which is 453.23.

I really zoomed out here on the daily so you can see exactly where some of these trend lines are at… we have officially broken upwards out of the red rising wedge that we have been trading in since the end of February… this now becomes a bull channel which is represented by the blue line… we are also in a shorter term black bull channel that we have been in since May 23rd. 

With a SPY daily closure at 427.92 this is the highest level that we have closed at since August 16th which was 429.7 and also was the top of the august rally and led us to our 52 week low sell off…

On the weekly we have officially closed our highest WEEKLY candle since the week of April 11th… not only that but we did close over the August peaks high and we now are in this 427.3 to 453.3 trading channel (orange). 

The weekly has closed over the weekly 8ema for 10 times in a row… that has not happened since August to September of 2021… 

With a breakout through the black and orange resistance lines… our next target is either the blue bull channel which gives us resistance at 439.4 next week or the red/ blue rising wedge at 435.23.

On the weekly timeframe here we have now bounced off 4130 demand (after establishing it) and have pushed through 4193 and 4384 supplies… this means our next upside target is 4540… Weekly remains in a bullish DMI wave up and bullish extreme momentum… at this point it is absolutely silly to short this.

Since I showed such a far out chart on SPY I will show more zoomed in here on futes… we have broken through the red rising wedge which now makes this the red/ blue bull channel. We are also in a almost month long black bull channel.

The resistance of this channel is 4357 and support is 4203 for Monday. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

On the weekly timeframe here we have broken through the shorter term black and red rising wedges… which pretty much solidifies us in this blue bull channel since early march. Channel resistance is 4420 and support is 4168.

Futures also is notching out just barely its highest close since April 2022. We are also coming in hot on these 4300 CC of the JPM collar and in two weeks will be at the 11th week post collar roll…

With this closure over 4280 we officially are in the 4280 to 4540. 

FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4193 -> 4284 -> 4540  
 Demand- 4130  
 Support- 4280 -> 4238 -> 4215  
 Resistance- 4238 -> 4392

Interestingly enough here honestly QQQ daily looks very weak… weak enough that if you had the grit one could actually short QQQ over the weekend… however, we are in daily and weekly extreme bull momentum so you are severely fighting the trend which is why I do not recommend it…

We are now sitting between 352.8 and 357.09 supplies… This doji candle could lead to a slight pullback and retrace to put in a new supply at 354.64 on Monday… support would be 347.93 if we did that… the DMI is still waving down and on Monday should complete that wave down… 

To the upside our target remains 357.09 and 361.7

**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

https://preview.redd.it/hr0ez5up3o3b1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=2668702bd0d320d53cbb910a9fa7eaa1ef5b0a52

QQQ weekly is absolutely begging for a pullback with a weekly DMI and supply/ demand indicator about as overbought as it possibly can be… This candle could as a weekly hanging man lead to a retrace next week… If we did that we would definitely add a new supply at 354.85. Our target for a bounce would be the weekly 8ema… This also is QQQs highest weekly close since the week of April 4th 2022. 

If we continue this upside run next week we have a supply at 361.85 to watch and then from there we have a pretty big resistance level at 382.9-384.54 to keep an eye on. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 330.67 -> 361.85  
 Demand- 322.47 -> 382.9 -> 384.54

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfi1947q3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a7de277dc50c6c68970a1f5b6b0fa8693854de

Yesterday I mentioned there was a high probability that we would get the VIX into the 14s… now I did not expect it to go as low as it did but absolutely incredible drop on the VIX… Here is some fun facts about just how low the VIX is right now… 

Today- LOD 14.42, Close 14.6  
 October 21st 2021- LOD 14.92, Close 15  
 June 29th 2021- LOD 14.1, Close 16.03   
 July 2nd 2021- LOD 14.25, Close 15.08  
 February 19th 2020- LOD 14.21, Close 14.38

This is the 3rd lowest level the VIX has hitting since Pre-COVID… this also is the lowest level that the VIX has closed at since Pre-COVID…

At these levels… the VIX is saying “we are at pre-covid fear in the markets and we are at pre-covid bull market levels.” 

Just for correlation here… SPY closed at 338.34 on Feb 19th, 433.72 on July 2nd, 427.7 on June 29th and 453.59 on October 21st… On average that means of the 4 lowest VIX readings in the last almost 2.5 years… SPY has an average closing price of 413.33… however, as you can see in July and June SPY was at the 427.7 to 433.72 level which is nearly perfect correlation to where we closed today…

Now today up until 130pm felt like an absolutely massive win mentally for me… I recognized the market and the trend… I recognized that the “perfect put opportunity” was actually the call entry in disguise… and I did really really good capitalizing on that and was up quite a bit… however, then came the 130 timeframe… 

It all went downhill getting stopped out attempting to play the support bounce with a call… and then from there I lost on two puts in a row on what looked like the worlds greatest put opportunities… the one I got absolutely massively stop loss hunted on and the other I got wrecked on… 

Honestly bless up for Mondays, Tuesday and Wednesdays in the market because I will fully admit without shame that Thursday and Fridays have been incredibly difficult for me to trade lately. Honestly from someone who is data driven and highly technical based in what I do… it appears that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday has been extremely technical based and flows as one would expect both up and down.. however, we get to Thursday and Fridays and its like the market just throws everything out the window and does whatever it wants… highly frustrating… looking forward to the weekend to mentally reset and tackle this market again Monday!",2023-06-02,16,23
13yor38_QQQ,QQQ,"The VIX just had its lowest close since Pre-Covid … 6-2-23 SPY/ ES futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis","I said this a few weeks ago and it remains true today… “It is far too early to short this market, but at this point it feels far too late to go long on this market too…” What does that mean? IT means while yes I do think at this rate the VIX could see 12-13 and SPY could see 430-440… at this point counting on this rally to continue feels like pure FOMO, however, counting on this rally to come to a dramatic end feels like straight YOLO… 

Another thing here is that while I do think the upside is the ease of momentum right now… the odds we wake up to a bank collapsing or some other black swan event seemingly is increasing as time goes on… this honestly is the worst place the markets could be right now…

The question I hate to be asking myself once again is “What is going to stop this rally?” I feel like for months now we get to these “ideal scenarios” that will finally put the market in its place and take it down etc. etc. and then the market just barely makes it by everytime… The way this thing is shaping up is that this truly is going to be a “this time is different” market recovery from bear market to bull market… OR we are just setting ourselves up for one of the biggest and most unexpected crashes this market has seen… 

**To Pause or Not to Pause**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1unexyqj3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=681b5f0f8b66ab06dd93cafcce4b6af4abd8572e

What is the one thing the fed wants but wont directly say they want? That would be higher unemployment rate… this mornings 3.7% UE is the highest reading since December 2022. However, since March 2022 (over a year now) we have NOT gotten a single UE reading over 3.7%.... it seems that the UE hits that level (4 times now over the last 1+ year) and then immediately retraces…

With the highest UE you would have expected the odds of a pause in June to nearly hit 80-90%... however, we are actually seeing a slight pullback here on the odds and now are looking only at a 70.1% chance of a pause in June… 

However, of course market is rallying like a pause and rate cuts have already happened. 

**Is TECH Topping out?** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d4c5ka7k3o3b1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=28fbb5b7050458bfb8a9814bba6136e6e250ab64

In the screenshot above you will see the breadth of S&P500, NASDAQ and NYSE… what does this show? Well in simple terms this shows the buying/ selling pressure of the market… 0 is neutral… what is very interesting to me here is that this is now the second day in a row that the NASD has lagged SPY and NYSE in the buying pressure… what does that mean? Well it means that for the last two days this rally was not led by TECH like previously… 

This is very evident by the heatchart here (taken near EOD)… what does it show? IT shows outside of communication services (which BTW took a big hit due to the amazon news as a whole) that TECH was the WEAKEST member today… this is a big deal… now there are two possibilities here… Market is rotating out of tech and into more small/ mid caps and going risk on because they truly believe the upside is the only way…. However, on the hand this could show that big money finally is slowing down here… I wish I had a way to show you guys for sure but the data im seeing is that the last few days has been heavily retail driven and not big money driven… 

**JPM COLLAR** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uscrr1sk3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=683550b60e60ba4b5b8f5b25e3c8daa4bdaded7d

Almost exactly two months ago we were post JPM collar roll and I mentioned the history of Futes hitting the sold call level of the collar (or within at least 100 pts of it)… very rarely do we completely pass it but it is possible… my timing assumed we would hit it the 7th week of the trend but it would appear that we are doing it at week 9… 

Now the true question is…. Will this pullback like it historically has after reaching the sold call level of the collar leading into the rotation of the collar (June 30th)? 

**UNTRADABLE**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wknaoc9l3o3b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ecf180515546881d405b7a887f06b6fd17b152f

I very rarely show a 15min intraday chart nor do I include it here but I think its worth it today… why? Well if you look at this chart today I would say that from 1030 until 1115am that was the ONLY time that SPY was easily tradeable today… the opening hour was extremely volatile and unforgiven… I attempted numerous times to catch plays on the way up and down and was not able to get in because SPX premiums were moving $2 in one second… just incredible movement…

If you trusted the extreme momentum of 1030 to 1115am you made some money… From there honestly I can whole heartedly say that from 1115am until EOD it was nothing but bull and bear traps… I haven’t seen so many bear traps in one day… I have never ever seen so many technicals are one time pointing to a put play only for the market to continue to push higher… just absolutely incredible movement on the markets today… This was a clear trend day as evidence by not touching or closing under 20ema all day besides one fast wick during opening hour… however, this was one of the choppiest extreme momentum days ive seen in a while… 

Ive said it before 2022 was hard mode in the markets… 2023 is turning into expert mode in the markets.

From the daily supply and demand here we did not do anything new… we did attempt to touch 429.68 supply and id fall just short of it… this gap up has us sitting between 422.04 and 429.68 supply. 

We did however get a fake wave down (half wave) on the DMI and now the DMI is waving bullishly.

From a weekly stand point here we were attempting to make a new supply up until Thursday when we rallied. However, the two day pump has put us once again with no new supply and with a weekly DMI that is overbought and with a weekly chart in extreme bull momentum. 

With a closure over 427.35 weekly supply we honestly have a huge gap to our next major level which is 453.23.

I really zoomed out here on the daily so you can see exactly where some of these trend lines are at… we have officially broken upwards out of the red rising wedge that we have been trading in since the end of February… this now becomes a bull channel which is represented by the blue line… we are also in a shorter term black bull channel that we have been in since May 23rd. 

With a SPY daily closure at 427.92 this is the highest level that we have closed at since August 16th which was 429.7 and also was the top of the august rally and led us to our 52 week low sell off…

On the weekly we have officially closed our highest WEEKLY candle since the week of April 11th… not only that but we did close over the August peaks high and we now are in this 427.3 to 453.3 trading channel (orange). 

The weekly has closed over the weekly 8ema for 10 times in a row… that has not happened since August to September of 2021… 

With a breakout through the black and orange resistance lines… our next target is either the blue bull channel which gives us resistance at 439.4 next week or the red/ blue rising wedge at 435.23. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 416.08 -> 427.35 -> 453.23

On the weekly timeframe here we have now bounced off 4130 demand (after establishing it) and have pushed through 4193 and 4384 supplies… this means our next upside target is 4540… Weekly remains in a bullish DMI wave up and bullish extreme momentum… at this point it is absolutely silly to short this.

You fucking monkeys don't know shit. You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. 

I’ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I’ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   
But I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. 

The hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   


It's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   
If you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, ""Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel."" You said, ""fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!""   
And that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   
So is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? 

I've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   
***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  

***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  

Let that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  

I don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. 

What the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!

Many current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*

The first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** 

We’re not going into recession, we’re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.

We’re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world’s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. 

TLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK

I missed taking the early move coming out of that pullback before the first green line at around 12.24pm market time because I hesitated and subsequently I didn't want to chase, so I did nothing. I had no idea just how much it would run for the next hour. Did anyone go long in the time period between the two green lines? If so, what were your rules for entering? I do realize from having asked a similar question the last time QQQ ran non stop, that one way is to look for a pullback on the 2 mins chart and take the first candle that makes a higher high. That setup would have definitely worked today, but I have such intense fear of it doing a massive pullback anytime. I generally prefer to wait to see a pullback first, then enter.

12z1k1b_QQQ,QQQ,QQQ doesnt paint the full picture for the Nasdaq 100,"So I am relativity new to investing (got into investing at beginning of Jan 2022) and you always hear that SP500 is the best index since it has every sector, very diversified, top 500 companies, and brings in 10% on average long term. You also hear that Nasdaq is all tech and risky but on the bull run its amazing growth. However, when you backtest QQQ since its inception you get like 8.5% annualized return which doesnt seem all that impressive.

But here came my mistake until this day, QQQ was incepted basically right before the dot com bubble and 2008 crash which significantly hurt its annualized returns. When you do the annualized return for the whole index which incepted 1985 til today the average is significantly different.

Nasdaq 100 Closing price of 1985: $132.29

Nasdaq 100 Closing price of 2022: $10939.76 (Prices can be found on wikipedia)

Index been around for 37 years

When you do the math to find the rate of return you will see that the index annualized return is 12.67%.

I know this info may be obvious to probably most of you guys but I think this is important info as im only 24 and have years to invest and being invested into the Nasdaq 100 can provide some really great growth. So just wanted to share this info and see what your guys thoughts are.

129wek0_DDOG,DDOG,"Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.","## Market View

**Last Week – Another positive week and an IV collapse.**

SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.

**This Week – A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn’t necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.

Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):

SPY could be viewed more neutrally with price stuck in a consolidation zone between two major TLs; however, when you factor the IWM and QQQ, probabilities suggest the break will go to the downside.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price remains stuck between two bearish levels: macro bear channel ceiling & the mico downsloping TL from the February 2023 pivot high.  A parralel channel upsloping TL entered the picture this week, which will eventually 'pinch' price to the upside or downside (probabilities favor the downside, look at the Weekly bearish consolidation).  385.65 is the support level to watch this week, the cross-point of the upsloping TL and bear channel TL.  On the resistance side, 401.05 is the nearest level which must be broken through before more major resistance around 410 can come into play.

**QQQ**:  Price stalled at the February 2023 double top; however, did not immediately reject the level.  Therefore, price could be putting in bullish consolidation.  Friday's close kept probabilities for more upside still neutral; a 3rd day of weaker close would have changed those probabilities.  Still, given the huge run-up in tech since the banking sector collapse, more consolidation may be needed before another move higher...if a move higher is what happens.  Next reisstances are 322.84 or 329.28 gap-fills, but the major resistance level is 334.42 double top from August 2022.  Major support remains the upsloping TL from the October 2022 lows.

**IWM**:  Price clearly rejected not only breaking back out from the bear channel, but also the upsloping TL coming off the October 2022 lows.  The resulting bearish consolidation (especially if you look at the Weekly chart) & the potential breakdown towards the end of last week places probabilities on further downside...but that doesn't mean we couldn't see some limimted upside by virtue of consolidation.  Nearest major support is 162.76 double bottom from October 2022; nearest major resistance remains the aforementioned upsloping TL (bolstered by the 200 DMA).

12310f2_LULU,LULU,Expected Moves this Week: SPY/QQQ on GDP and PCE plus earnings from Lululemon and Micron,"## Market View

**Last Week – Another positive week and with it lower IV**

SPY was up 1.4% on the week, less than the 2.6% move options were pricing. However, once again the market had multiple swings and had about. 2.6% range. The week saw an FOMC announcement and some guidance of what’s next, but also saw some mixed signals from Treasury on deposit backstops for the banking industry. The VIX fell from 26 to start the week to 22 to end the week. The banking sector was once again the focus. The regional bank etf KRE had an 8% range for the week but finished the week where it started. XLF saw about a 5.5% range and also finished about unchanged. The 2-year yield closed the week at 3.77%, down slightly on the week and down from 5% on March 7th.

**This Week – GDP and The Fed’s Preferred Inflation Report**

SPY options are pricing about a 2% move for the week. Earnings season is winding down and the next one picks up in Mid-April. In between the market will of course be watching bank stress, but this week also sees the GDP print an important inflation report (PCE) on Friday. The SPY is about 4.5% above its 2023 lows and about 5% off its 2023 highs. With IV a bit lower now, the options market is not currently pricing a move to either level until early May:

The Russell 2000, which saw the largest decline of the market etf’s over the past few weeks saw the largest decline in IV last week. Options are pricing a 2.7% move in IWM this week, compared to nearly 4% last week.

**Last Week – Another positive week and with it lower IV**

SPY was up 1.4% on the week, less than the 2.6% move options were pricing. However, once again the market had multiple swings and had about. 2.6% range. The week saw an FOMC announcement and some guidance of what’s next, but also saw some mixed signals from Treasury on deposit backstops for the banking industry. The VIX fell from 26 to start the week to 22 to end the week. The banking sector was once again the focus. The regional bank etf KRE had an 8% range for the week but finished the week where it started. XLF saw about a 5.5% range and also finished about unchanged. The 2-year yield closed the week at 3.77%, down slightly on the week and down from 5% on March 7th.

**This Week – GDP and The Fed’s Preferred Inflation Report**

SPY options are pricing about a 2% move for the week. Earnings season is winding down and the next one picks up in Mid-April. In between the market will of course be watching bank stress, but this week also sees the GDP print an important inflation report (PCE) on Friday. The SPY is about 4.5% above its 2023 lows and about 5% off its 2023 highs. With IV a bit lower now, the options market is not currently pricing a move to either level until early May:

The Russell 2000, which saw the largest decline of the market etf’s over the past few weeks saw the largest decline in IV last week. Options are pricing a 2.7% move in IWM this week, compared to nearly 4% last week.

11uzybj_ANET,ANET,The Week Ahead & More: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM + Trade Journal,"**OVERALL**:  The Fed meeting will likely cause consolidation, but the regional banks & energy could force a move.  IWM showing the weakest chart this week with a possible bear flag forming within the bear channel.  SPY is trading at the bottom of a parallel channel, suggesting a potential small bounce given all of the MA & TL resistance directly overheard.  QQQ is pretty extended after last week's vertical move, but there is still a little room above before it hits a likely stall point.  If money leaves tech & flow back into other sectors, we could see an inverse of last's week trading...as arguably last week we saw QQQ break out from bullish consolidation, SPY continue bullish consolidation, and IWM break down from what had been bullish consolidation.  That said, on the weekly & monthly charts, we are still very much trading in a larger bearish pattern.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price never did officially breakdown back inside the bear channel; on the contrary, it did validate its move outside the bear channel.  The repeated tags on both side of the channel ceiling, however, weakens the line for both the bulls & bears.  Price seems to be trading within an upsloping parallel channel since Fall 2022, which puts probabilities on the bear's side for an eventual breakdown & re-test of the October 2022 low.  Before reaching that level, however, there is a major resistance level at 370 by an ascending TL (which also is trading parallel to the aforementioned parallel channel).  There will be some resistance at 402 descending TL, but major resistance is the upper range of the parallel channel, which is beginning to converge with the 431.73 mid-August 2022 double top

**QQQ**:  Price did indeed tag the ascending support TL Monday before ripping higher all week, as tech saw big cash inflows from instituitons seeking comparative 'safety' from the regional banking collapse & energy breakdowns.  The near resistance levels got blown through all week, but price has not officially broken out yet from that descending resistance TL -- we need a close above 307.18 to do so.  If we get it, then that descending TL becomes major support; otherwise, major support remains the upsloping TL at 286 - 287.  Continued upside will likely pause at the 313.68 level, but if it can get through that then major resistance is between 318 - 320 which connects some pivot highs-to-lows from the past year.

**IWM**: The regional bank collapse prevented a sustained bounce of the major support level that was the bear channel ceiling, but 170 did provide support throughout the week.  The multiple closes within the bear channel, and failed attempts to get out of the bear channel, is problematic for the bulls.  This week's price action could be bear flag consolidate between 170 and those former support TLs, which could be setting up for a move to retest the October 2022 pivot low at 162.76 -- the nearest major support level now.  If upside returns, then major resistance will be the ascending TL between 179 - 180 this week -- which will soon also converge with the 200 DMA.

11te8ts_EA,EA,Lowest Four Market Caps in both SP 500 and QQQ as options strategy,"Over the last 10 years, the four lowest market-capped tech stocks that are members of both the SP 500 and QQQ and held for a year have outperformed the SP 500 by right at 300%. (19.7% to 11.6% per year). Right now, on 3/16/2023, those four tech stocks are:

1. ANSS: USA ANSYS, Inc.
2. CSGP: USA CoStar Group, Inc.
3. EA: USA Electronic Arts, Inc.
4. CTSH: USA Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

The approach I am thinking of is to buy OTM nine-month calls at two strike prices above the ATM. Then sell if any hit a 30% loss or go above four strike prices above the current ATM. Any thoughts or experience is appreciated.",2023-03-17,3,2

11oul1o_UAL,UAL,The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price & its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.

**QQQ**:  Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level.  Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support.  First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high.  Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move.  The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all.

**IWM**: Price fell & closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, ***but*** the SVB collapse, & weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored.  If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom & an ascending long term TL converge.  Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top).

11oul1o_AXP,AXP,The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price & its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.

**QQQ**:  Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level.  Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support.  First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high.  Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move.  The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all.

**IWM**: Price fell & closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, ***but*** the SVB collapse, & weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored.  If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom & an ascending long term TL converge.  Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top).

11l5gs9_QQQ,QQQ,question about adding QQQ to roth ira,"DISCLAIMER: Read the whole post because even though it starts out sounding like a “VOO + SCHD” post but thats not what this is about. 

anyway. currently holding about 80-85%my roth in voo/vti (i know theyre pretty much the same so no real reason to hold both, but i started with vti then decided id rather just get a bunch of voo so growing that but saw no reason to dump the vti i already have) and the remaining 15-20% in schd. i also think though that if every single person here is doing that and im tired of reading about it, i need to put my money where my mouth is. im thinking adding qqq for growth while continuing to grow my position in voo, then just let the schd i already have earn dividends and drip but not submit anymore buy orders on it for now. anyway,, im wondering what you guys think would be a good portfolio allocation for a 22 year old between QQQ and VOO (planning to grow them both to a point that the schd position is negligible) because i know the more QQQ i buy the lower my dividend yield on the portfolio but the higher my growth potential becomes. also if theres an ETF thats not SCHD or JEPI that youd recommend over QQQ please let me know. ive heard QQQM wouldnt be a bad move for the longterm. thanks for the advice in advance",2023-03-07,0,6

VOOG is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500® Growth Index, which represents large-cap growth companies in the US. The fund employs an indexing approach, which means it aims to replicate the index's performance by holding the same stocks in the same proportion as the index.

On the other hand, QQQ is an ETF that tracks the NASDAQ-100 Index®, representing the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Similar to VOOG, QQQ also uses an indexing approach, adjusting the portfolio to reflect changes in the index.

Expense Ratio: 0.10%

Dividend Yield: 1.23%

10yr Return: 13.62%

### QQQ Details

118enxm_QQQ,QQQ,VGT vs QQQ - Growth ETF Comparison,"VGT and QQQ are both popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide investors with exposure to the American stock market. However, there are a few key differences between the two. VGT is focused solely on technology stocks, while QQQ includes stocks from other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer services. 

As a result, QQQ may be slightly less volatile than VGT. Additionally, QQQ is market cap weighted, meaning that larger companies have a greater impact on the fund's performance, while VGT is equally weighted, giving smaller companies a more significant role. 

QQQ is often referred to as a tech ETF. However, it is only tech-heavy since the largest companies are in the tech sector. If a new industry were to overtake tech stocks in terms of market capitalization, the Nasdaq 100 index would reflect. The only industry not included in the Nasdaq is the financial sector.

Ultimately, the choice between VGT and QQQ will depend on an investor's individual goals and risk tolerance. VGT may be a better fit for those seeking higher potential returns and are willing to accept more volatility, while QQQ could be a good choice for those seeking a more diversified portfolio with less volatility.",2023-02-21,0,0

VTI invests in all the CRSP US Total Market Index stocks, providing broad exposure to various sectors and industries. 

On the other hand, QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, with a heavy focus on technology.

The Mar 2022 rally failed at the bottom of the first bar; Aug rally at the bottom of the second bar, Nov rally at the bottom of the third bar, the Oct low at the bottom of the fourth bar.

After forming a low in Oct, $QQQ moved above the Nov high. This has been a change from what happened before, it didn’t establish a lower low. A full measured move of the Oct low to Nov high would project a price target to the Aug high, so $330.

$QQQ closed around the half way point of the third bar (red line). If it closes above that level, so $313, odds would favor the completion of the measured move to $330.

The Nov high, the bottom of the third bar, around $292.50 is a must hold support level .

Then again, major events such as this speech can very easily blow past technical analysis probabilities...so we shall see.  Either way, from a swing trading perpective the volatility remains high, which is resulting in continued opportunites on both the long & short side.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Index continues to 'lag' slightly behind the others.  Price traded generally within range from the previous 3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming just beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.  If it breaks out, next major resistance is a gap-window between 420 - 422.  Major support remains around 397 the bear channel ceiling.

**QQQ:** Price traded generally within range from the previous 2-3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.  If it breaks out, next major resistance is 3111 pivot high.  Major support remains around 283 the bear channel ceiling.

**IWM**:  Surprisingly big move (and on average volume) considering the Fed speech this afternoon.  Had volume been lighter I maybe would've expected it.  Price shot through major resistance and must close above 191.58 to turn that TL into support.  Next major resistance is 196.00 which is a decade-old TL you can see if you do not factor in the COVID spike.  Major support remains around 181 which is the  former resistance TL from the bear chanel.

**Thesis:**  NatGas continues to slide, but the fall rate is definitely slowing.  I already have a 3.5% size position in UNG shares long with an average of $10.18 -- and with the slower fall rate, adding to that position is not going to bring my DCA down significantly.  Therefore, I added this options position to increase my exposure.  I chose a 0.33% position size so I can add to it two more times if IV or price action pushes the options down further.

**Symbol**:  AMGN  
**Entry Price**: 12.50  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis:**  Consistent and significant fall in price from recent ATHs.  Into several major support areas: 1) 250-250 pivot hights prior to the October price surge; 2) 61.8% Fib retrace from that price surge; 3) 200 DMA.  Price dropped 2% immediately AH but recovered over the course of the night to almost up 1%.  We will see how it behaves in the pre-market.  If this opens green, given the Fed speech this afternoon, I will likely close even if the move is not as big as I would've hoped...mainly because of how sharply it dropped right after the close.

Markets will likely be quiet heading into Wednesday afternoon's Fed decision, which most analysts believe will be a 0.25 hike.  I have to maintain a neutral-to-positive bias considering how 2 out of 3 indexes re-tested their beear channel ceilings and those levels held, but I would not be surprised to see price move back into the bear channel in the weeks following the Fed meeting.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Compared to QQQ and IWM, this index is actually lagging from a technical perspective.  It took the longest to break out of the bear channel (and just barely did not with Friday's close), it has yet to reach the last pivot high, and has has yet to re-test the bear channel ceiling.  Therefore, price remains 'stuck' between these 2x major resistance and suport levels: 410 and 398 respectively.  The facts that it 'gapped out' of the bear channel, and both QQQ+IWM have reached major pivot high support, leads me to think price will hit 410 before the Fed on Wednesday.  But the way it gave up in the final hour of trading on Friday...maybe just people taking profits into the weekend, or maybe indicating it will not reach that pivot high.

**QQQ:**  This week I'd say tech finally 'caught up' to IWM from a techincal perspective, considering it both 1) broke out of the bear channel (which IWM did a couple weeks ago) and 2) reached the last pivot high (which IWM did at the same time this week as well).  That said & of note, IWM has pulled back to re-test its bear channel ceiling (now a major support level), whereas the QQQ has not, so this is the nearest major support around 284.  Price is currently into a major resistance level, but if it can get through then next resistance is just over 311 which is the next pivot high and also a pretty big gap fill between September 12-13.

**IWM:**  Great price action from a technical perspective.  After officially breaking out of the bear channel, price went back to what turned into a major support level (as a result of the breakout), and then rallied to the next major resistance level -- which we hammered on the last 2x days.  The next major resistance level is around 196, which is a very long term ascending channel ceiling the pre-dates all the madness we've seen since COVID stimulus.  The nearest major support level remains around 181, the bear channel ceiling and now also the 200 DMA as well as the TL which lead to the failed bear flag pattern.

10kfq5x_JNJ,JNJ,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // JNJ LMT CVS,"**OVERALL:** A bit of a 'pause day,' at least by comparision to the moves we've seen lately.  All trading occurred (so far, 15 minutes to do) within yesterday's candle; therefore, there shouldn't be any major changes in terms of support or resistance levels.  Of note, it looks like neither the SPY nor the QQQ will officially break out of their bear channels...at least not today, unless either or both shoot up in the final minutes, I guess.  The SPY currently look the most 'at risk' of failing the breakout entire, by closing back down inside its bear channel.  QQQ looks slightly more comfortably above, bolstered by the gap-fill support level it is sitting on top of (having just filled it yesterday).

10jp5mp_NFLX,NFLX,Technical Analysis & Trades: SPY QQQ IWM // NFLX JNJ LMT UUP,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors added to the up-moves from Friday, and all are now out of the bear channel resistance.  My bias is neutral-to-positive in the coming days-to-week timeframe, basically leading into the Fed statement; I could see consolidation & 'floating up' into that speech.  From a technical perspective, there are numerous resistance levels lingering just above where the current price action is, so a little more upside into the Fed would be a good thing to see before we ultimately head lower in the weeks-to-months timeframe.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout.

**QQQ:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- and compared to IWM, more similar volume vs Friday's move higher.  Price must close above 290.21 before re-entering the bear channel for that descending TL to be viewed as a major support level.  Nearest resistance is 293.66 the 200 DMA, with major resistance at 296.88 pivot high.  Major support remains the  274.78 flag's top and ascending TL convergence.

**IWM**: Another solid move up; however, note the significantly less volume today vs. Friday's candle.  Another up day on even lighter volume may suggest exhaustion. Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

10dr0ol_NCLH,NCLH,The Week Ahead & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  I remain in the camp that last week's move (especially the IWM) was only meant to lure in retail investors.  The failure for all 3x majors to clear the bear channel (or even for them all to reach it) in my opinion suggests there is not enough momentum behind even the IWM's very clear break out.  That said, while volume was light for most of the last week, it did not seem incredibly light.  I could make an argument for the reversal to come as early as tomorrow...or...I could make another for SPY and QQQ to join IWM's break out, and then the reversal comes.  So who knows...I certainly do not...just my guess.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  The 'mid-range' chart compared to IWM (leading) and QQQ (lagging).  Unlike IWM, price has yet to breakout of the bear channel; but also unlike QQQ, price has at least cleared the gap window and is knocking on the channel ceiling.  Friday's close left price right at the major support level, which is only firming as the gap-fill and bear channel descending TL converge.  If price follows the small cap's lead, then 410.49 pivot high is the next major resistance level.  If price fails, then 387.41 bear flag's top will offer some support, but 382.27 is the major support level which the bulls need to hold.  If the bear's regain control of the micro-trend, then 368.79 will be tested again as the next major support level, more so than the bear flag's bottom (374.77) in my opinion.

**QQQ:**  Tech continues to lag in terms of hitting technical levels.  Price has yet to reach the gap-window,  let alone the bear channel ceiling.  As a result, 282.33 will offer some resistance, with 186.51 - 288.21 being the major resistance level this coming week.  If price manages to breakout here as it has in the small caps, then the 200 DMA and 296.88 pivot high will be the next major resistance.  If price fails at these levels, then 274.78 - 273.72 is a major support area as 2x former breakout trendlines converege.  This the bulls cannot hold this level, then 259.08 is the next major support area.

**IWM**: Friday's close officially made the bear channel's descending TL a support level. If price continues higher, next resistance point is 189.56 pivot high from November/December 2022; I believe this will be a major level.  Additionally, around 195 is a long-running channel TL from where the index was trading leading into the COVID-collapse; this, too, should be a major resistance level. If the bears roar back from the holiday, the bear channel TL at 183.05 is first support (and major, if the bulls want to hold the trend). Failure to hold that level will bring 180.19 into focus as the next support, but I believe ths level will be minor.  Lastly, the ascending TL which lead to these series of breakouts is the final major support level at 175.25 - 176.50 over the course of the coming week.

10dr0ol_AAL,AAL,The Week Ahead & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  I remain in the camp that last week's move (especially the IWM) was only meant to lure in retail investors.  The failure for all 3x majors to clear the bear channel (or even for them all to reach it) in my opinion suggests there is not enough momentum behind even the IWM's very clear break out.  That said, while volume was light for most of the last week, it did not seem incredibly light.  I could make an argument for the reversal to come as early as tomorrow...or...I could make another for SPY and QQQ to join IWM's break out, and then the reversal comes.  So who knows...I certainly do not...just my guess.

&#x200B;

10akun4_QQQ,QQQ,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**: Today's move higher saw our first pierce of the bear channel celing, courtesy of IWM.  With the upcoming long weekend, I expect volume will be light tomorrow which may cause price to drift higher, sending SPY above the bear channel as our second major index to do so.  That said, I am still in the bearish camp, as on the macro time frame everything we are seeing is occuring at the lower range of the down move we saw over the entire couse of 2022.

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price tagged the 200 DMA before pulling back.  Major resistance remains immediately overhead at 399.40 to 401.35.  Given the potential breakout of the bear channel in the IWM chart, I could see price floating through those levels tomorrow on light, pre-long weekend volume.  If price reverses, then 387.41 flag's top will offer some support, with major support at 382 ascending TL through the former bear flag.  Antoher major support level is at 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).

**QQQ:** By comparison from a technical perspective, a 'quiet' day, but today's close did officially turn 274.78 into a support level -- and it is also being bolstered by an ascending TL.  The first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom & previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.  Nearest resistance remains the 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.50 descending TL channel ceiling.

**IWM:** Yet again a leading indicator, price punched through & closed above the bear channel.  Price must close above 185.95 before dipping back into the channel to officially turn the TL into a support level.  Given the coming holiday weekend, I would not be surprised to see price float into the 188 - 190 resistance level tomorrow. If price reverses, then 180.19 is nearest support, followed by 176.80.  The first major support level is that ascending TL cutting through the former bear flag.

**Last Week – A Rally to Start 2023, Powered by NFP**

SPY closed 1.5% higher for the first trading week of 2023, largely on the back of Friday’s positive market reaction to employment and wage data. The VIX is now near 21, down slightly on the week. But options for this week are comparatively high, more on that in a second.

SPY closed 1.5% higher for the first trading week of 2023, largely on the back of Friday’s positive market reaction to employment and wage data. The VIX is now near 21, down slightly on the week. But options for this week are comparatively high, more on that in a second.

**This Week – Options expecting movement for CPI, Earnings Season Gets Real with the Banks**.

SPY options are pricing a 2.2% move for this week. The primary uncertainty for the markets this week is the CPI release, which will arrive pre-market Thursday morning. The SPY expected move chart via Options AI shows low IV into the release and the majority of this week’s expected move and an IV spike for Thursday:

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential break out of the bear flag; price came into that convergence area of 20/50/100 DMAs before pulling back.  Price must close above 389.25 to validate the move, before closing below 387.41 back under the flag's top.  Nearest resistance is 394.30 gap-window from December 15th, followed by major resistance at 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA has now fallen just below).  Max upside remains 402.50 within the current channel.  Nearest support is now 380 ascending TL within the bear flag, followed by 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).  Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:**  9x days into this bear flag pattern.  While tech saw the biggest percentage move, the fact is price remains within its bear flag and also under its ascending resistance TL; therefore, no break out (yet).  Nearest resistance is 272 ascending TL (where the 20 DMA has now reached), then there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is beginning to converge with the channel's descending upper TL. Nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom & previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:**  Potential break out of the bear flag; price perfectly hit the 178.03 gap-window before pulling back.  Price must close above 178.04 to validate the move, before closing below 176.80 back under the flag's top.  Nearest and major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, with the 50/100 DMAs just under the level and the 200 DMA just above the level. Max upside remains around 184 the channel's upper TL. Nearest support is 173.25 the ascending TL within the bear flag.  Moderate support is 170.67 the flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

**Avg Price**:  42.39  
**Exit Price**:  46.81  
**Position Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I closed this position on 3x days of solid up move and as price went into a resistance zone created by multiple pivot lows from September thru December 2022.  Since the position size was not even a full 1% or more, I closed the entire position; had it been bigger, I would have closed 1/2 to see if the other half could run to those descending TLs above 50.

The next major support level is 91.63 -- I will add up to 2% to the overall position.  My target is around $136 the original breakdown TL, which is now also where the 20 DMA has come down into.

**Thesis**:  These trades are similar in that I believe money is rotating into them as relative ""safety plays"" given the volatility we're see across the markets and economy writ-large.  However, I believe even these ""safety plays"" will see trouble as the economy hits deeper recession, especially when the Fed does not lower rates (as the market has come to expect) in 2023.  When this realization finally hits, the money rotating into these names will rotate out and head for foreign investment (China, Brazil, etc).  The fact price in SPY, QQQ, and IWM are making a move to their upper descending TLs only bolsters my conviction, as hitting those levels to set up the next move down to break the Fall 2022 lows should provide an opportunity to cover these shorts.",2023-01-07,10,0

104jusl_QQQ,QQQ,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL:** The bearish consolidation continues across all 3x majors, with price floating at the center-to-lower range of each flag.  The charts did not change; therefore, I am just posting the text update today.

&#x200B;

**SPY**: 13x days into this bear flag; trading occured on slight below average volume. Nearest support is 374.77 flag's bottom, with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.  Nearest resistance is 387.41 flag's top flag which is still bolstered by the convergence of 3x MAs: 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the major resistance at 389.63 gap fill remains just above this level. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill; of note, gap fill is now also where the 200 DMA has fallen down into. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:**  8x days into this bear flag pattern; trading occured on slight below average volume. Nearest support is 259.08 the flag's bottom & previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. Nearest resistance is 271.50 ascending TL (also where the 20 DMA is fast approaching), then there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 13x days into this bear flag; trading occurred on below average volume.  Nearest support is 170.67 the flag's bottom is still the nearest support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows. Nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's top. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, which is now also where the 50 and 100 DMAs have crossed/converged. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

I executed 2x trades today: 1x trade to open a position and 1x trade to close a position.

**Type**: Sell to Close (Final)  
**Symbol**: MARA  
**Return**: + 7.37% (8.7% across both tranches)  
**Entry Date**: 12/08/2022  
**Avg Price**: 3.75  
**Exit Price**: 4.03  
**Position Size**: 0.75%  
**Thesis**: As discussed in yesterday's post, I closed the position as price pulled back below the 20 DMA and gap-window during the pre-market.

 

**Type**: Buy to Open  
**Symbol**: UNG  
**Entry Price**: 12.00  
**Position Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: I entered this position today as price piereced a double-bottom hitting major support dating back to late 2021. I took a full 1% position becuase of how extended price is to the downside (14 or 16 days, depending on which pivot high is used).  In hindsight, I should have set a 0.5% position to trigger at 12.00 (in the event the whole-round number provided support) and then another 0.5% at 11.69 (the lowest pivot from late 2021).  Today's price action reached a low of 11.62 -- so a perfect pierce of that double bottom.  My next tranche will be at 11.26 the gap fill from June 2021. There are multiple exit points I am considering on this trade; which I execute will depend on how price moves up into them.

103piyc_QQQ,QQQ,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL:** Further bearish consolidation across all 3x majors, as price action occured entirely within yesterday's move and also occured on average volume. Daily MAs are now at-or-below technical resistance levels, which will only make the bulls have to work that much harder to overcome. While price may still rise on the days-week timeframe (e.g. micro trend), such a move would very much be part of natural, bearish consolidation on the weeks-month timeframe (e.g. macro trend).

&#x200B;

**SPY**: 12x days into this bear flag & trading occurred entirly within yesterday's move and on average volume. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag which is now also being bolstered by the crossage of 3x MAs: 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the major resistance at 389.63 gap fill remains just above this level. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill; of note, gap fill is now also where the 200 DMA has fallen down into. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price pivots lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:** Price remained entirely within yesterday's move here as well, and may still be the 7th day of a bear flag pattern. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 271.50 the ascending TL which got tagged yesterday.  If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA crossed below today). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.  If price pivots lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:** 12x days into this bear flag; trading occurred on average volume & entirely within yesterday's movement, again.  Both the 20 DMA and ceiling of the bear flag were tested again today, and held again.  This obviously weakens the level from a resistance standpoint, but it remains the nearest resistance point at 176.80 if price continues higher.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, which is now also where the 50 and 100 DMAs have crossed/converged. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.  If price heads lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is still the nearest support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

I executed 4x trades today: 1x trade to open a position and 3x trades to close positions.

**Type**:  Sell to Close (Partial)  
**Symbol**:  MARA  
**Return**:  + 10.04%  
**Entry Date**:  12/08/2022  
**Avg Price**:  3.75  
**Exit Price**:  4.13  
**Position Size**:  0.75%  
**Remaining Size**:  0.75%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade over a few tranches as price fell into several major support levels dating back to late 2020. Today's move brought price to 4.13 gap-window and the 20 DMA, at which point I exited half the position.  Ultimately, the move today filled the ap at 4.34 before pulling back slightly towards the end of the day.  I will look to exit the 2nd half tomorrow depending on how price reacts through the overnight.

**Short Price**:  94.55  
**Cover Price**:  87.45  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**: I entered this trade as price hit its 16th day of forming a bear flag and as it reached the highest point of the consolidation zone which formed the flag.  I entered with only a 0.5% position thinking I would add another 0.5% to 1% if price returned to $98 -- but it never this that secondary/add level.  I chose to exit this position as price hit 87.45 the 200 DMA.  Had the position size been larger, I would've exited half the position to let the other half run, but given it was just the entry-size, I closed the trade entirely.

**Entry Date**:  12/30/2022  
**Entry Price**:  85.92  
**Exit Price**:  91.65  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade after missing the entry I actually wanted, which occurred two days prior as price fell into 2x major support levels.  However, price lingered close enough around those support levels, which allowed me to get in without ""chasing"" too-too terrible.  I only entered a 0.5% position in the event price continued lower after the New Year, but it did not.  Therefore, I chose not to exit the position yesterday when it hit the 20 DMA because of my small position size -- and likewise, I do not want to wait until price reaches that descending TL at the risk of price reversing beforehand.  In short, the small position size did not give me a much flexibility as I would've liked in this trade, but I would rather have less manueverability getting out of positions if it means preserving capital to maneuver into positions.

**Type**:  Buy to Open  
**Symbol**:  MOS  
**Entry Price**:  42.39  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this position today as price piereced a double-bottom hitting major support.  The reason I only took a 0.5% position is becuase the choppy grind down to the level, in addition to the consolidation from December 15 - 27, would make it not surprising if we saw more downside in the near term.  My next add level is 39.95 gap-fill from mid-January 2022, which coincides with a bullish consolidation zone whcih occured in late-December 2021.

102qzx1_NCLH,NCLH,Daily Review: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL:**  Today's price action saw some very cool levels being hit or nearly hit from a technical perspective across all 3x majors.  The gap-up at the opening bell, followed by an immediate sell-off and then consolidation at the lower range of the 10-min chart candles suggests a bear-flag was built at that very micro, intraday time frame.  This is not to say tomorrow will be a continuation of that down move, just that price definitely consolidated from about 11:20 until the closing bell at the lower range of the trading day.

&#x200B;

**SPY**: 11x days into this bear flag & trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Price just missed doing the same head fake / fake out as we saw on IWM.  If price continues lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.  If price turns around & heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Given today's price action, I will amend my ""bear flag"" measurement from December 13th to December 22nd, which means today's candle could be the 6th day of what is becoming a bear flag pattern.  Today's move to just miss that ascending TL (which had only recently become a resistance level) played out perfectly as price pulled back from the level. If price continues lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.   If price turns back around & heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 270.70 (that same ascending TL), but it could be 'weaker' now. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA is sitting). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 11x days into this bear flag & trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Beautiful pierce of the flag & 20 DMA, which I suspect caught many traders off guard, as price pulled back from that level into the flag as a head-fake / fake break out.  If price continues lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.  If price turns around & higher, then the nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

**QQQ Best -- 335**  
**QQQ Mid -- 211**

^(Mid = Most likely low before the index goes sideways/consolidates out of its bear channel)  
^(Worst = Lowest level I could see the index hitting if price collapses below its bear channel)

&#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price is decidedly in a descending, bearish channel since breaking down from ATHs in late 2021/early 2022.  This channel has been tested 3x thus far in 2022 without any sign of its upper TL weakening; however, the steep descending angle is likely not sustainable for the entirity of 2023.  Therefore, the first support level which could give the pivot/bounce which truly tests this bear channel is likely 339.08 the pre-COVID pivot high.

However, if this level fails to give a sufficient-enough bounce, then a nearby level at 321.28 is a retrace area from the COVID V-shape breakout.  The 318 - 321 level is fascinating, because it not only includes that aforementioned retrce level, but is also near the 61.8% Fib retrace (318.24) from the 2020 COVID low to 2022 ATH -- and urthermore -- this level will coincidentally intersect the upper TL of our bearish channel in mid-to-late 2023 if price cannot challenge (or potentially breakout) beforehand.  And as if that was not enough, also coming together at this mid-to-end of 2023 intersection point is another major support level: the ascending TL which formed off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, which is a level only pierced during COVID.

If price falls at the fastest rate its current channel predicts, and in doing so cuts right through all of those major support factors before mid-2023, then price will hit another major support level at 305.70 the ascending TL off the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  And if price just utterly collapses in 2023, then the final major support level I could see it reaching in 2023 is at 273.50 where the current descending support TL from the January 2022 pivot ATH will cross the 2007 pre-financial crisis pivot ATH...this TL is also where price retraced in 2019 and 2020.

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 431.73 where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from September 2021 to June 2022.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through those multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

https://preview.redd.it/vkwuphwfvf9a1.jpg?width=2296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad93d7760d3448e39301f3408031feba8c63f89b

**QQQ**:  Compared to the S&P and Russell, the NASDAQ experienced a more parabolic rise -- and as a result -- has fallen at a faster rate.  The NASDAQ already bounced 1x off the 61.8% Fib retrace from the COVID-low to the November 2021 ATHs; therefore, I do not expect this level will provide long term support in 2023, e.g. the momentum needed to breakout of its bear channel.

The nearest level of support which could give this type of bounce may be the confluence between  234.93 the pre-COVID pivot high, and an ascending TL off the 2007-2008 financial crisis pivot highs (which, coincidentally, is currently within the bear channel and cutting through the pre-COVID high level).  Depending on the QQQ's rate of descent, these 2x support levels will intersect with the current upper TL of the bear channel in mid-to-late 2023, much like certain intersections on the SPY chart.  All of that said, I still do not believe this will be the pivot low in 2023; instead, I believe the QQQ needs to retest at least 225.88 the 75% Fib retrace, but more likely 211.71 where price pierced/retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery.  Interestingly, these 2x more practical levels (to me anyway) are scheduled to intersect the bear channel's upper TL in late-2023.

However, when you look at just how much the QQQ has risen compared to IWM or SPY, it does seem conceivable that price could do a full 100% retrace of 164.93 the COVID-lows...

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 315.59 the 31.8% Fib retrace level up to 334.42 where price pierced that Fib level during the past year's decline.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

**IWM**:  Compared to the S&P, the Russell is closer to the same type of major support levels; for example, the SPY is testing its 31.8% Fib retrace vs the IWM testing its 50% Fib retace.  And yet unlike the NASDAQ (which is testing its 61.8% Fib retrace vs the Russell's 50% Fib), the Russell did not experience the same parabolic climb to ATHs; therefore, the NASDAQ should be expected to be seeing a bigger pull back.  As a result, IWM may be a leading indicator during 2023 in terms of when the bottom is put in across all 3x major indices...assuming the bottom comes as part of a more natural market cycle (e.g. grinding lower to a definitive pivot point, then turning higher) than a 'flash event' (e.g. similar to what we see looking back at COVID).

The nearest major support level is 162.76 triple bottom, and while this level is being bolstered by an ascending support TL coming off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, the macro consolidation which has occurred at/near these levels since mid-2022 is enough to make me question is either level will give the IWM enough momentum to break out of its bear channel.  Instead, I believe a more likely level to challenge the bear channel will come around 152 where price pivoted & retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery, as well as the 61.8% Fib retrace from the 2020 COVID low to November 2021 ATH (as mentioned, QQQ already retraced to its 61.8% Fib level).  If this level cannot at least shift the IWM into sideways chop/consolidation out of the bear channel, then the lowest point from a technical perspective in 2023 could be 141 - 145 where the current resistance descending TL intersects with an ascending TL from the 2008 pre-financial crisis pivot high to a retrace from the 2018 pivot low.

On the more positive side -- if price can breakout of the bear channel & then retest the channel's upper TL, the max upside could be 216 which is where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from January 2021 to January 2022.  However & similar to SPY & IWM, to reach this level would require moves that breakout through 2x major ascending resistance TLs.  Instead, a more likely ""bullish"" case could be sideways chop/consolidation at-and-through these levels.

**See you on the charts in 2023**",2023-01-01,21,11
zzbevi_QQQ,QQQ,Daily Review & Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**: Impressive surge in the final hour of trading to almost close the gap-fill from this morning's open; my guess is short covering.  Even with that spike, I will sum up today as a 'pause day' -- both in terms of the majors digesting yesterday's bounce + trading at 50% average volume due to holidays.  Since the action occurred inside yesterday's candles, no sense in posting new charts -- and -- all the same levels from yesterday still apply.

https://preview.redd.it/k7i82sjmn39a1.jpg?width=2318&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6311de1d8f52bf2a34e4a47b149a8718f5d4ac7e

**SPY**: 10x days into this bear flag & trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle.  If price continues higher , nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price turns back around, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

&#x200B;

**QQQ:** If you use December 13th to 28th as the pole, then today's candle could make for the 2nd day of what could beome a bear flag pattern.  Price traded almost entirely inside yesterday's candle. If price continues higher, nearest resistance is 270.70 the ascending TL which officially became a resistance level after yesterday's close. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL. If price turns back around, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. 

&#x200B;

**IWM:** 10x days into this bear flag & trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle. If price continutes higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL. If price turns right back around, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

I executed 1x trade today:

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: LONG  
**Stock**: DIS  
**Price**: 85.92  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Price is down almost 60% from its March 2021 ATHs, 45% from the start of 2022, and now coming into an area with a lot of technical support: COVID candle lows between 85.84 and 81.09 -- as well as a descending TL from June 2022.  I missed my desired entry 2x days ago because it did not hit $84 even (it hit 84.07...of course).  When I saw yesterday's pop, I thought the bounce was in; today's retrace gave me a chance to enter at a level which is admittedly bordering on 'chasing' (hence the 0.5% position size).  I will bring this to a 1.5% position if price hits 79.07 the COVID-low double bottom.  My first target is $95 which is based on a descending TL (not charted below, sorry) connecting its pivot highs from November 2021 to 2022.

**SPY**: 9x days into this bear flag, as today's reversal remained well within the flag.  If price continues higher tomorrow, nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging.

**IWM:** 9x days into this bear flag, but of note, a daily close back inside the flag...which negates the potential 'breakdown' from yesterday's close below & restarts the 'look out.'

**Price**: 183.36

Most significant is December 13th: significant gap-up, failure to hold above the previous ATH, and major bearish engulfing candle.  Since December 15th, price has formed a bear flag. I entered a small 0.5% position because 1) light holiday volume should cause price to float higher naturally; but more importantly 2) the gap-up this morning above the 20 DMA.  I will add another tranche a 186.50 -- then use a upper channel  TL tag to add a 3rd tranche depending on how price moves into that level.

My new target is $130 to 135, but depending on how price returns to that level, $165 is not out of the question...but probabilities no longer favor that initial target.

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: SHORT  
**Stock**: PEP  
**Price**: 183.36  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: From mid-November to mid-December, price saw 3x failed breakouts while trading in upper-range of channel. Most significant is December 13th: significant gap-up, failure to hold above the previous ATH, and major bearish engulfing candle.  Since December 15th, price has formed a bear flag. I entered a small 0.5% position because 1) light holiday volume should cause price to float higher naturally; but more importantly 2) the gap-up this morning above the 20 DMA.  I will add another tranche a 186.50 -- then use a upper channel  TL tag to add a 3rd tranche depending on how price moves into that level.  Depending on the overall position size, my first target to cover is the 200 DMA at $172, followed by the lower channel TL at $165.

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Most ""clean"" bear flag of the 3x majors. Just barely missed the gap-fill from November 9th.  If price floats higher on the expected light holiday volume, it must break 389.63 to negate the bear flag.  394.30 will be a more significant resistance level since this is where the formerly bullish consolidation broke down.  If it can get through those levels, then 399.40 is another gap-fill.  Max upside is 403.73 (Tuesday) to 402.80 (Friday).  Price must get above that descending TL for the bulls to have any hope of regaining control of the macro trend.  If price breaks down this week, then 374.13 could provide some support, but likely not much because of that near-miss of gap-fill on December 22nd.  Moderate support level at 365.50 which is an ascending TL from 2016.  Major support level which could get tagged this week if price truly breaks down is 358.50 the COVID low TL -- but again, the holiday volume will likely prevent that kind of a move lower.

**QQQ**:  The least ""clean"" bear flag formation of the 3x majors, perhaps because it is the only major to retrace down to a technical level on December 22nd's gap-fill.  If price floats higher this week, it must break back above the TL it broke down through last week: 275.50 (Tuesday) to 276.75 (Friday).  If it can, it will hit major resistance at 280.72 where its previously bullish consolidation also broke down.  For bulls to possibly regain the macro trend, the descending TL around 293 must be broken & held above.  Conversely, if that double-touch of the 263.32 gap-fill level weakened the level and price breaks down further, the COVID-low TL at 261 will likely not provide much support now that price has consolidated somewhat around this level.  Instead, the double-bottom at 254.26 should provide major support.

**IWM**:  A clean-ish bear flag, and most notable is the unsuccessful break out on December 21st.  As a result, 175.68 will likely provide only slight resistance if price floats higher this week.  Instead, 180.19 will be major resistance, as it is not only a gap-fill but also the level where previously bullish consolidation broke down.  If price manages a serious break out, then 185.50 to 186.40 will likely be max upside; price must hold above those descending TLs for the bulls to regain control of the macro trend.  Conversely, if price breaks down this week, there are a couple support levels at 168.78 (previous COVID pivot high) and 167.90 (COVID-low TL); however, given how much price has consolidated just above these levels, they will likely only offer temporary support.  Instead, the double-bottom at 162.50 is major support and should offer a more significant technical bounce.

zttelw_QQQ,QQQ,Daily Review: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,"**OVERALL**:  Price ""floated"" on very low volume (50% of average) and remained entirely within yesterday's candle.  With the sideays chop seen this week, an argument could be made that we are 5 or 6 days into a bear flag forming off the latest down move from December 12 - 16.

&#x200B;

**SPY**: Nearest resistance at 386.58, then 389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Nearest support at 380.54 to 378.28 -- major support at 365

&#x200B;

**QQQ:** Price again recovered off support at 263.32 -- major resistance remains at 280.72 -- where bullish consolidation broke down. Major support is between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

&#x200B;

**IWM:** Most ""bullish"" price action today of any major, but definitely relative.  Nearest resistance is 175.68 -- then major at 180.19 gap-fill. Nearest support is that same 171.18 pivot low, with 167.78 to 167.55 being a major level.

If price breaks down further, I will add another 1% at 2.15 -- gap fill from July 22/25, 2016 -- and then another 1% at 1.80 (pivot lows from ealry 2016).  First target is $3.34

**SPY**: Barely retraced back into yesterday's candle. If upside continues, first resistance is 385.18 and 389.63 gap window/fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance.  For the bulls to regain control, the failed-breakout descending TL must be broken around 405.  If selling resumes tomorrow, modest support should come at 374.13 gap-fill, followed by a decade-old ascending TL around 365 until hitting major support at the 357.70 COVID-low TL.

**QQQ:** Price failed to close within yesterday's candle, but at least it did not validate the breakdown of its ascending TL. If upside continues, first resistance will be that ascending at TL 273.90 -- followed 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  Similar to SPY, major resistance remains around 295 the pivot high TL.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** The most solid retrace by any major, but on the least amount of volume.  If upside continues, first resistance will be gap-fills at 175.68 and 180.19 with major resistance between 186.40 to 185.95 at a confluence of descending TLs.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is 167.78 pre-COVID pivot high with major support  between 167.55 to 167.75 the COVID-low TL.

**Last Week – Some selling ahead of the Fed**

SPY fell 3.4% last week, a much larger move than options were pricing. The majority of the move lower happened on Monday and Tuesday and the market went sideways to close out the week. With the combination of the move lower and with the market now looking ahead to this week’s FOMC decision, implied volatility rose across the board. The VIX rose from 19 to nearly 23 and SPY IV for this week nearly 30. More on that IV anomaly below.

**This Week – Options are pricing movement this week**

SPY options are pricing a nearly 3% move for the upcoming week. About twice what options were pricing last week. The Fed rate announcement is this Wednesday of course, and option vol is high for this week relative to after. How high? SPY options this week are 29 IV compared to 21 IV for options expiring Dec 30th. QQQ vol is 34 for this week and 27 for Dec 30th. In other words, options are pricing the majority of the move for the balance of 2022 to happen this week. The expected move in QQQ this week is 3.4%, which is the majority of its expected move of 4.4% into year-end.

To illustrate the move for this week, an Iron Condor set at the expected move would be max gain if SPY closed the week between $382 and $405. That’s near where the latest rally stalled and well below recent lows of the past few weeks. Here’s how that looks on the chart:

zgffhe_QQQ,QQQ,Investing in QQQ for the long term,"As soon as we make it out of this bear market, I see on the horizon AI tech revolutionizing many industries this decade , in particular the tech industry, by automating away many of the tasks and processes that are currently performed by white collar workers. Although this will not be good for workers, it will increase efficiency and productivity for the companies, leading to higher profits and improved financial performance for shareholders. 

The big tech companies (i.e. Google, Microsoft, Amazon) will unlock huge revenue streams selling AI products to other tech companies whose productivity in turn will increase as they are able to do more with fewer workers. 

Imo the pullback in tech this year is a good opportunity to buy tech/QQQ cheap and profit off of the coming wave of AI growth and innovation.",2022-12-08,3,26

z3r3lq_QQQ,QQQ,ATM 30 DTE QQQ Cash-Secured Puts Income Strategy,"Hi! Any feedback on my QQQ income-strategy is appreciated. Feel free to ask clarifying questions as well if I've missed anything.

My plan is to sell a single ATM QQQ cash-secured put with 30 DTE every week and hold it until assignment or expiration. I am willing to get assigned up to a maximum of 12 contracts at a time.

This is on an account with 30+ year outlook so I'm not too fearful of getting assigned on Qs. I would like to optimize this strategy with the assumption that the market can make new highs, new swing lows, but ultimately goes sideways over the next decade. 

I understand that there is a risk of an extended bear market where I'd get assigned on all 12 CSPs across several months as price drops. This would lower my cost basis but also restrict me from generating income from CSPs on a consistent basis.

To avoid being assigned on all 12x at the same time, I've got a delta sliding scale for my CCs. If I only have 1-3 contracts assigned then I'll sell lower delta CCs to try and capture some intrinsic value. If I have more CSPs assigned then I'd increase the CC delta to 0.50. Any income generated from CCs is just bonus though. The ultimate goal is to stay liquid so can keep selling CSPs.

If ever all 12x contracts are assigned then I'm in Repair Mode and selling CCs as aggressively as I can to get out breakeven at net cost basis (avg. assigned strike minus all premiums generated from selling CCs).

My understanding so far of this strategy is that it will:

* Underperform buy/hold in bull market as never collecting any intrinsic value.
* Outperform buy/hold in neutral market as collecting a ton of extrinsic value when a buy/hold would just be going sideways
* Outperform buy/hold in bear market as constantly lowering cost basis

Thoughts?

TLDR; Sell 30 DTE ATM CSP on QQQ every Friday. No rolls, no SL. Max 12 bullets. If assigned 12x then max delta CCs to get out ASAP and continue selling CSPs.",2022-11-24,20,63

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 5.9% last week and has now bounced about 12% from the 2022 lows (made in mid October.) It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec ’21).

The big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.

The 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term. In fact, IV is now lower near-term, than it is out a few months, as seen by this 1 year SPY chart showing expected move levels and IV:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mg7bcudquz91.gif

Bottom line, with the IV crush that accompanied the market rip higher last week, options are not pricing in a retest of those recent lows anytime soon. (In fact, options aren’t pricing those lows or the near-term (August) high until late Winter.)

And IV, which is about 19 near term in SPY, increases as you go out expiries, with options out in March around 23 IV.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.0% move for the upcoming week or about $8 in either direction. That is down from a 2.6% ($10) move options were pricing last week (actual move \^$22).

Speaking of that $22 move higher, from last week’s post:

>With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher.

Last week didn’t just see a Powerball winner, it also saw some of those lotto ticket upside calls win as well. Perhaps some of it was positioning for the chance of a CPI induced squeeze.

The economic calendar this week sees Retail Sales (as well as several big retail earnings) here in the US. This could be a scenario where hot numbers would be bad for the market because of inflation implications.

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down.

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names.

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",2022-11-13,243,55

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 3.3% last week, erasing most of the gains made the week before. The majority of the move lower came immediately after a slightly more hawkish-than-expected press conference from Jay Powell following the FOMC rate change and statement. The market rallied on Friday and kept last week’s selloff from being even worse.

The 3.3% move lower was more than the 2.5% move options were pricing. The market has been moving more than options were pricing fairly consistently over the past month. Despite that, vol continued to trend lower, with many of the big earnings reports, plus the FOMC decision now out of the way. However, the election looms this week and that could keep a bid on options for the next few days. 30 day IV in SPY is about 24, with realized vol (actually moves) over the past month around 27. (for reference, realized vol for the past year is around 23, so 27 the past month means the market is volatile, even for 2022)

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of about $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 25. Its lowest levels since mid-September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

With IV coming in the past 2 weeks, the skew of options is shifting, with upside calls in SPY and QQQ now more expensive (relatively) to the at-the-moneys than they had been when IV was higher. The reasons why are numerous and unimportant is some ways, but from a trading perspective, it means that debit call spreads that buy ATM and sell upside strikes are more favorable than they have been in recent weeks (not to mention they are lower IV overall).

The economic calendar this week has an important CPI number, and of course, the mid-term elections are on Tuesday, with reactions beginning with Wednesday’s session.

**Last Week –** SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple’s 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

y9eh73_BAC,BAC,Covered Calls On BAC? DCA’ing into QQQ for the remainder of the market downturn?,"I apologize if this is somewhat long winded but I’m looking for solid advice before sticking my nose into the market full force. For some background I was first introduced to the market by my fraternity brother in late 2020. Since then I have experimented with multiple strategies and came to a basic understanding of the market as well as the fundamentals of option trading. I should also include the fact that my financial situation is not fantastic. I currently make around $500 weekly so I am not destitute, however I am not wealthy by any means. The strategy I have landed on given my monetary status and current risk tolerance is DCA’ing into QQQ as the market continues to fall as well as DCA’ing into BAC until I collect 100 shares to sell CC’s against. Is there any glaring reason I should choose a different ETF such as SPY over QQQ? Does Bank of America present itself as a solid stock with low volatility and risk that would be suitable to sell CC’s against (preferably with the strike above my DCA)? Am I a total dumbass or does this seem like relatively realistic strategy that could leave me with a solid portfolio and some % of alpha even if we don’t see another bull market for 5-10 years?

TL:DR

I am 22M with mediocre investing knowledge looking to capitalize on the market downturn and scoop up quality stocks cheap to in turn sell CC’s against on the slow grind back to all time highs. Bank of America for CC’s and QQQ as my ETF to throw $$$ at. 5 years from now will I be sitting on a solid sum of shares in good companies or sitting on my knees behind a dumpster at Wendy’s?",2022-10-21,5,13

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.

The move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week. The VIX ended last week around 31 and implied vol remains near its highs of the year.

## Earnings Season in High Vol

This week marks the beginning of earnings season, with a lot of eyes on the large banks that report towards the end of the week. Earnings season in a high vol environment means that options need to price both the earnings event itself but also the potential for large market moves into and out of the event.

That means trading the event itself needs to be fairly precise, with strategies placed just before and taken off just after in order to isolate the event itself. Here’s an example, with Wells Fargo (WFC) options pricing in a 5.2% expected move for the week ([Options AI free tool link](https://tools.optionsai.com/companies/WFC)).

To put that into some very recent perspective. WFC closed last week up nearly 4% and at one point during the week was higher by nearly 8%. The other banks reporting this week are also pricing around 5% moves, more on that below:

The only thing that seems to feel the pinch of higher interest rates is less home buying and less auto purchases.

Aside from that, inflation has barely budged, unemployment is back at historic lows at 3.5%, and inflation is still very high.

It doesn't seem like businesses (stocks) have said announced negative effects from higher interest rates, is this mostly true overall?

Is the stock market really down -24% prior to any real effect from higher interest rates entering the economy or is there another reason?

It seems like a 2 part process.  The fear of all these rate hikes scaring the market.  Then the rate hikes finally showing real economic effects on businesses that inevitably bring the stock market another leg lower?

## In the News

Last week I looked at how high vol was in the FAANG+ names and detailed some Iron Condors in Amazon. AMZN stock closed last week about where it ended the week before, however, overall market IV was higher. So a scorecard on high IV neutral trades would look like this so far. Stock not moving: yes, IV going lower: no.

Most of these names begin to report in late October with some reporting before Oct 21st expiry, like TSLA, and others after, like AMZN and GOOGL. With that in mind, and with IV even higher let’s look at another high IV strategy for those that may be looking to turn bullish in a stock. We’ll use GOOGL, as an example, using Oct 21st expiry, as earnings don’t come into play until the week after. And we’ll compare two credit put spreads, one at the money, the other out of the money:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lj9t0zoejer91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe2ac758c23c94bad4a83411afa6174485e531c

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sqs7itrfjer91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=da22cbc31d24db489f667c11d13290ed83f5482b

The first put spread sells the at the money put and buys the expected move put, risking 3, to make 2, if GOOGL is above $94 on Oct 21st. With the way stocks are whipping around this type of trade can be thought of as a fairly straightforward bullish play, with a little but of wiggle room below where the stock is trading (but not much). The more important factor is with IV this high, this trade doesn’t need a big snapback rally. It just needs a small one, or even one that starts from lower and just gets back to this point in the stock. In other words it doesn’t necessarily need to have its timing exactly right, nor its magnitude of move exactly right. Playing for a reversal with calls or debit call spreads kind of needs to have those things perfect at this point, with IV so high.

The second trade is an out-of-the-money put spread, risking about 75 to make 25 with its strikes set at the expected move. This is the type of trade someone does when they just think IV is beginning to overprice downside risk, and often at levels where they’d psychologically be a buyer of the stock. The advantage with a credit put spread vs a cash-secured put is that if the market crashes, it’s just a $75 loss rather than unlimited risk below.

GOOGL is simply an example here. There are a ton of similar stocks with similarly high IV at the moment. Eventually, there will be a snapback rally where calls work, but until then it’s interesting to look at some credit spreads and the defined risk associated with selling moves rather than trying to time them for a reversal.

TLT is down more than 30% since Dec ’21 and down 10% since August 1st. Options are pricing about a 4.3% move a month out, and about 8% into year-end:

**Last Week –** The SPY rallied 3.6% last week, more than making up for the prior week’s 3.1% decline. Options were only pricing a 2% move, so that’s several weeks in a row where options have been underpricing market moves.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** After 2 weeks near 26, the VIX declined to close last week, under 23.

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we’ve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock’s volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here’s the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

Even if you didn't believe this was a bear market rally or in technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline break is a rarity, lots of people spot and bet on potentials but here we have the real thing, even if on a short time frame.

Personally, I always thought this was a bear market rally taken to extreme levels of hopium and I'm not sure the bottom is in.  But at least with the h&s I'm pretty confident we have some more short term downside in the next few days.

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

Will I definitely be assigned come Monday morning?





Update:  For anyone interested, I did get assigned the shares when I checked Monday morning at 7am.

Received a margin call email from my broker.

Closed the position at the open once the QQQs hit $305.  Only to watch it go to $307 just 5 minutes later.  So, if I waited 5 mins I would have actually broke even.

Anyway, big loss for me, but at least I did not blow up my entire account as I feared.

Moral of the story, don’t pickup pennies in front of a steam roller.  What was a trade to earn some Friday night pocket change, ended up costing me a chunk of my savings.  

Thanks to all the wise people who predicted correctly that I would get assigned.  

However,  @vegastrashy, you are clearly uninformed on this matter. You confidently proclaimed  I would not get assigned if the price remained above the put strike by 4pm.  You were flat out wrong.",2022-08-26,115,269

Curious as to what you would invest in today. I would like to continue building a portfolio of SPY, but considering I’m 20, I was thinking about buying a decent amount of QQQ first, then buying SPY after I have a decent amount of QQQ.  

My biggest worry is that I could still lose decent amounts of money. If I invested in QQQ in 2000, my investment in SPY would be worth more from DOT.com bubble. 

Does anyone feel QQQ is overvalued for P/E ratios?

w6cdha_META,META,Weekend Trade Review - $QQQ $AKAM $META,"Hello traders! Here's another review of some trades I took earlier this week. Constructive criticism always welcome. What would you have done differently?

# QQQ Short

[July 18, 2022 - $QQQ 5-min chart](https://preview.redd.it/fn2qlaniucd91.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=74def638f669f249e320643a34526fa8cc53be29)

**Setup:** Sell Setup at Retest of PDC  
**Entry:** 291.75  
**Stop:** 292.15  
**Target:** T1: 290, T2: 288  
**Result:** \+4R  
**Comments:** Trade had more room towards yesterday low around 288-289, but market was getting volatile following $AAPL news. Made a post about this particular setup on Monday.

# QQQ Long

[July 19, 2022 - $QQQ 5-min chart](https://preview.redd.it/itunpmprxcd91.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=941c00c97b523445331288f4ced6847cc18b486b)

**Setup:** Buy Setup off rising 20SMA  
**Entry:** 297.5  
**Stop:** 297.25  
**Target:** 299  
**Result:** \-1R  
**Comments:** Looked like we were going to push and fill the 299 gap in Power Hour. First pullback following 1:30 PM Base Breakout. Shaken out during flush (see below). Probably should've used 297 whole number as stop since no other meaningful support nearby. Ended up filling gap in after-hours.

[July 19, 2022 - $QQQ 1-min chart](https://preview.redd.it/1apxkbcxycd91.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fbb55aa7b4b53eb059b8444257ce6006c11e05)

**Setup:** Climactic short at unfilled gap level from June 10-13  
**Entry:** 1st 96.40 / 2nd 96.60  
**Stop:** 1st 97.05 / 2nd 97.5  
**Target:** Back to rising 20SMA $92-$93 area  
**Result:** 1st -1.2R, 2nd +4R  
**Comments:** Took two tries. Shorted after 97 whole number rejected. Looked good with huge topping tail then got squeezed over HOD. Re-entered on *breakout no-follow through* (BO-NFT) on 2-minute chart (not shown).

**Setup:** Sell Setup after Topping Tail rejected declining 8/20  
**Entry:** 172.90  
**Stop:** 173.4  
**Target:** T1: 170 T2: 169.15  
**Result:** \-0.3R  
**Comments:** Chickened out. Moved original stop after pop above 173 and double bottom. Rejected prior pivot for a double top and then flushed. Missed the move.

# QQQ Short

[July 22, 2022 - $QQQ 5-min chart](https://preview.redd.it/a3w0o02h5dd91.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb430e10ccf02b80673c2abf5878754585bda95c)

**Setup:** Sell Setup at Retest of LOD  
**Entry:** 304.9  
**Stop:** 305.45  
**Target:** T1: 302.5, T2: 301  
**Result:** \+4R  
**Comments:** Could've exited earlier after ending volume and doji (was very extended). Got out during pullback to declining 8SMA using bar-by-bar (BBB) on 5min.

&#x200B;

**Note about my day trading strategy:** I use price action, pivots, and MA's to trade 3 main setups:

1. **Pullbacks:** Buy/Sell Setup
2. C**onsolidation Breakouts:** Triangle and Rectangle Bases
3. **Climactic Reversals** Parabolic Tops/Bottoms

I follow trending stocks using the following timeframes:

* Patterns and setups identified off the 5-min
* The 2-min is used to fine tune entries
* The 15-min for multiple timeframe alignment (MTFA)
* Hourly and daily for bias and support/resistance areas off pivots/levels
* General trade management: Bar-by-bar (BBB) and All-or-Nothing (AON) towards target

**From a Techical Standpoint we have:**

\- We are currently filling the last gap (Fills at $298.86)

\- Approaching the upper trend line (aprox. 298)

\- Approaching the 50MA ($305.4, lower by time we ge there)

So from a Techical Standpoint its heavily stacked and looks bearish.

**From a fundemental Standpoint we have:**

* GDP numbers coming out, which is widely believed to confirm that we are officially in a recession.
* Consumer confidence reading
* 5 Fed officials speaking J Pow included
* Important manufacturing data

So from a macro and event driven standpoint i dont see anything that would move the needle either.

**Bullish counter argument:**

* If against all expectations GDP data doesnt come out negative the run will contiune
* J Pow and other Feds can come out and say that numbers coming out are good and market is pricing them properly
* We can finally get the breakout from the falling wedge on the 1D chart
* SPY has higher gaps to fill and might pull QQQ up more with it

In  my opinion i dont see how in the term the bullish case plays out, my  stance is still we are at or near bottom but that doesnt change the  facts presented.

Im picking up 2  week out puts on QQQ, will wait for a runup to get a starter and load  more on any further run-ups. We still have small room to move up until  at least the gap fills so im not rushing this.

Do note that VIX is abormally high PM, and more often than note, this give us a red day.

Will hedge my postion with shorter dated 1 week calls QQQ.

The  reason for the hedge is that i dont expect the market to run past this  week. If it does i will be closing my Puts postion anyway as by that  point if we are still running we ahve broken out of the falling wedge  and above data was likely good.

**Last Week –** Markets made another outsized move last week, this time to the upside. SPY was higher by more than 6%, a significantly larger move than the 2.7% move options were pricing. That follows weekly moves of more than 5% lower the past few weeks. The majority of last week’s move higher happened on two days, Tuesday to start the week, and Friday to end the week.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.4% move for the upcoming week (about $9 in either direction), which is slightly less than last week. This week includes the end of a month and quarter for markets on Thursday (so an additional ETF expiry on Thursday) followed by a weekly expiration Friday into a 3 day Holiday weekend. So a lot of variables that options sometimes have a difficult time pricing.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 27, down from 31 the prior week. From last week’s write-up:

>the VIX was near 35 several times last week which is close to the highs the VIX has seen in earlier spikes this year (March and early May). In both those earlier cases a VIX above 35 marked a temporary low in the market.

A VIX spike to 35 once again marked a tradeable low in the markets. Prior market bounces this year ran out of steam with the VIX 19 in early April, and 23 in early June before stocks reversed lower. The VIX is still historically higher than average.

* QQQ **3%** (+/- $9)
* IWM **2.8%** (+/- $5)

### In the News

One month ago we checked in on oil & gas stocks and noted that despite the stocks “crashing higher” alongside the price of oil, implied volatility in the equity options was not spiking like implied volatility in commodity options tends to. That left equity options vulnerable to underpricing a reversal in oil prices:

>For example, OXY was a $10 stock in Summer 2020 and a $28 stock to start 2022. It is now $70. Exxon Mobil started 2022 near $60 and is now approaching an all-time high near $100. Despite a move from under $85 to $98 in the past *3 weeks*, XOM options aren’t pricing that sort of move, higher or lower until September. OXY is up $15 in the past month yet options are not pricing that sort of move until September either.  
These stocks have seen investors pour in and the stocks have “crashed higher” towards all-time highs alongside oil itself, but the implied volatility of options in the single names are acting more like a stock near highs and less like a volatile commodity near highs where one typically sees IV *increase* as the commodity price goes higher. Meaning Puts and Put Spreads in particular may cost less than might otherwise be expected. Something to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to hedge.

The commodity side of things did indeed reverse the past few weeks, to the tune of about 15% in some cases. And Occidental (OXY) and Exxon Mobile (XOM) followed suit. OXY and XOM are both down roughly 18% in the past month, even more than Oil. XOM options are pricing a move of around 20% for the rest of 2022. A move that wouldn’t even take XOM back to its highs of a few weeks ago. This is one example of how the expected move can be used as a gut check versus the stock chart itself, a way to see implied volatility for what it truly is… how options are pricing moves in the stock versus how the stock is actually trading.

On the crypto-affected equities side of things, Coinbase (COIN) options are pricing about a 13% move this week, Microstrategy (MSTR) options are pricing about a 14% move.

The expected move in MSTR for the week is around $26, which lines up at about $174 on the downside, near its early May lows.

### In the News

Amazon stocks has a new look Monday following a 20 for 1 split. Options positions from Friday will be x20 contract-wise on strikes now divided by 20. New trades going forward will be using the new strikes. There’s no general rule for how a stock and its options trade following a split. Studies have shown some differences between small and large-cap stock volatility post-split. Many stocks will see a period of increased volatility (also reflected in the option IV) following the split that takes a period of time to settle down into a new normal. However, AMZN’s split occurs in a market that has been volatile and IV that is still somewhat elevated vs historical averages. The only thing traders can look for is any increased retail interest in what are now much more reasonably priced (dollar-wise) options. This could affect things like upside skew and the potential for spreads or selling options vs stock that can benefit from skew in a way that retail was previously unable to affect due to the large dollar prices of most options in a $2000+ stock. Something to keep an eye on.

It initially looked like Alphabet would do its announced 20 for 1 split this week as well but it is now likely mid-July. Amazon shares saw a fairly decent run-up into its split. GOOGL options are pricing about an 8% move out to July 15th:

Well another day another full ass reversal that makes 100% no sense at all. This is how I know the markets in a weird place when reversals start happening over and over again I know markets ready to make a big move. I favor a bull run over the next two weeks leading into CPI on 5/11/22.

In all retrospect though we pretty much had a sideways range day trading within a $5.57 range. With major support at 414.5 and major resistance at 418.

I hate to scream manipulation or just overall BS on intraday movements but the fact the VIX unwound from 32.72 all the way to 29.26 end of day and SPY didn’t see a 2%+ rally is a little sus for sure. Intraday watching the volume and the VIX you could tell it was being artificially clapped down and forced to trade here within this 414.5 to 418 range. It didn’t want stay under 414.5 and it sure didn’t wanna break that 418. The odd thing is that 418 really was not a major support at all. 420 I could have seen rejection there and strong resistance but 418 really doesn’t add up. 

I think the MM had this held down until JPOW drops the rate hike tomorrow personally. But we will get true market sentiment tomorrow morning.

See where we are at right now and where they pinned us at? That’s right… they pinned us right against the bear channel resistance line that’s going on two weeks long now (started April 21st). So that means we are either going to see a massive move down again or a massive breakout. Personally I favor the breakout. I think over night we are going to hold this 415.7 support and trade near 418 and break the channel over night and see a fairly bullish morning and once (and hopefully once) JPOW cements it with the 50bps markets will see a massive EOD rally tomorrow and trade higher into the end of the week. 

Now if JPOW comes out with something wild like a 75 or 100bps hike well we are gonna get that massive sell off and break that 400 level.

On the daily we pretty much are leveling up as the week goes on. With bouncing off the 405 support and finishing at 415 support yesterday. Today SPY attempted to break lower but ended up rejecting resistance at 420 (failed to make it there officially) but managed to hold support EOD at 415.

Tomorrow SPY Bulls will look to break that 420 level and break the now resistance at the daily 8ema of 421.13. An ideal finish for bulls tomorrow is above 428 resistance which means they need to see a larger 2.8% move tomorrow, but at minimum bulls nee this to close above the daily 8ema and closer to 425 which is a 2% move tomorrow. After two days of less than 1% closes it seems like a tall order but with the vix near 30 it should be fairly easily especially on a big fed news day. 

Tomorrow bears will look to break that 415 support and close at or below the 410 support level. This would be easily obtained if JPOW drops the 75 or 100bps hike.

Personally I think we see the 50bps hike. From what ive been reading and hearing the expectation now is three 50bps hikes (May, June and July). The narrative is currently inflation is peaking so it would be a little surprising to see something outside of that. JPOW with the exception of January has also been very predictable and the market likes predictable. So unless we see the 50bps at 2pm and then JPOW during questioning says something to spook the market I really forsee a fairly green rally tomorrow.

Apple had a great day today in terms of longer term bullish momentum. As I had mentioned very rarely does Apple drop more than one candle in a row below the 200ema and look at that they closed it back above the daily 200ema which now sits at 158.17.

However, bulls were not able to break that daily 8ema at 160.35. I will look for bulls to close near that daily 20ema at 163.59. Bears will want to see this closed back under the daily 200ema tomorrow.

QQQ is in a similar position of SPY with it leveling up but failing to breach its daily 8ema and failing to breach the next level of resistance which is 323 for QQQ. 

QQQ bulls will need this to break 323 and aim for a close closer to that next resistance level of 328 for an end of week rally. Bears will look to break back below the support at 318 and push for another lower low by end of week.

The VIX had a pretty massive day today actually. I was impressed to see it unwind from its heights of 32.82 to its low of 29.06 for a total of 12.9% movement downward today. But SPY failed to see and do anything with this. Normally a movement like this would bring SPY to the moon but as I mentioned the intraday volume clearly was keeping SPY down. 

Now that we are back closer to the currently happy VIX spot of 28 to 33.5 it will be interesting tomorrow to see if the VIX rockets back near 33 of if its going to start its unwind back down to its 2022 average closer to 18-21.

The last one on my log the 1dte calls at -50% I ended up selling half my current position and decided to ride the rest till tomorrow and put some faith in JPOW and the market to have a rally tomorrow. Either way cutting that at 50% today takes 1/3 of my risk off the table as I am carrying actually a lot into tomorrow that I don’t normally do at all. Its definitely not what I had planned but my calls got wrecked so fast and I failed to exit when I had the chance at -30% so decided I was just going to let them ride. With hopes of an IV spike tomorrow morning/ afternoon due to JPOW and just overall feeling bullish I made a calculated play. Overall if my call positions go to -100% I still wont be hurting too much. Overall it would hurt but it is what it is at this point. Putting faith in JPOW to get that printer on one last time. Overall for all three of my positions I wil need to see 425 tomorrow if IV was to remain the same to breakeven.

Hyperwheel wise I was able to roll my puts one time for a small credit so im getting close to beating buy and hold. 

I was looking for an EOD rally but that didn’t happen to close these puts at a pretty nice profit but right now I am slightly green and as of now letting them ride. With these not expiring till Friday and my break even already about $3 lower then when I sold them due to theta I feel pretty confident that by Friday these will be profitable to roll into next week green. Worst comes to worse EOW I will roll one more time till next Friday expecting a rally next week.

I was looking for an EOD rally but that didn’t happen to close these puts at a pretty nice profit but right now I am slightly green and as of now letting them ride. With these not expiring till Friday and my break even already about $3 lower then when I sold them due to theta I feel pretty confident that by Friday these will be profitable to roll into next week green. Worst comes to worse EOW I will roll one more time till next Friday expecting a rally next week.

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jkso764uxdt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce353f49c56cc33456c8e5394357d8c12c510d4a

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting.

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57.

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week.

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",2022-04-14,14,11

The day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. 

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c5b3gkqfqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0102c35a2a85acc9fef190e2f194e8c285284d5a

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mymji2jgqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7450d1700fb29082bfcb0ccde34638e1f82d5157

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&#x200B;

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&#x200B;

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation Crypto took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. BTC broke its major support and is now below 40k and ETH broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",2022-04-12,13,10

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c5b3gkqfqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0102c35a2a85acc9fef190e2f194e8c285284d5a

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mymji2jgqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7450d1700fb29082bfcb0ccde34638e1f82d5157

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&#x200B;

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. 

&#x200B;

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz4j8manqzs81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=85501a00d711a631528288d3e261e0acbb5213e5

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation Crypto took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. BTC broke its major support and is now below 40k and ETH broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",2022-04-12,11,10

Meme/story stocks saw an uptick in activity last week, with unusual options volume and in many cases, increases in implied volatility. Here’s some highlights from last week with special focus on stocks that saw spikes in volume and IV. Many of these stocks had reached low dollar levels, so a quick change in sentiment ramps option volume and prices quickly. Increases of option volume vs 30 day average (on Friday), implied vol vs 360 realized vol (on Friday), and IV Rank that was unusual are indicated. This is by no means an exhaustive list but gives a good sense of what was happening as traders turned their attention to these types of stocks after a long lull:

**BB:** option volume: +600% IV30 vs 1yr: +136%, IV rank: 100% (earnings, expected move this week: 11%)

**BBBY:** IV30 vs 1yr: +148%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11.5%)

**GME:** option volume: +800%, IV30 vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 13.5%)

**NKLA:** option volume: + 400% IV30, vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 9.5%)

**TLRY:** option volume + 2300% IV30, vs 1yr: +207%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 20%)

**CRON:** option volume: 1000% IV:30, vs 1yr +155%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11%)

**ACB:** option volume: +2000% IV30, vs 1yr +194%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 17%)

**RIOT:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 9%)

**FUBO:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 8%)

Whether this is a “dash for trash” towards the end of a big move higher in the broader market or the beginning of a turnaround in fortunes for stocks that had been left for dead remains to be seen. But it’s a reminder of how quickly increasing option volume can lead to large leaps in option prices in stocks with a history of “crashing higher.” Here’s a quick look at how many of these names show up on volume scanners from Friday (via Options AI):

tp56y9_OKTA,OKTA,"Invesco is spending a lot of money advertising QQQ as ""access to innovation"". Does that claim hold up?","Note: I originally posted this in r/collegebasketball, but it got removed as they're more interested in bar graphs created in MS Paint so I'm posting here (Yes, I am a bit salty). I took out a section explaining ETF's as I assume anyone here has a decent grasp of what those are

**TL;DR** 

There are some innovative companies in the holdings of QQQ, but not near as much innovation happens here as the commercials would have you believe. Using the methodology described below, I (very subjectively) find the QQQ fund to have an ""innovation rating"" of **49.27%**. 

**Intro/Background Info** 

If you're watching the NCAA Basketball tournament, you've probably seen the advertisements for the Invesco QQQ fund, claiming investors are ""part of the team"" and ""taking part in innovation"". Tossing aside the dubious first claim (you're no more part of any team than Packers stockholders are; holding shares in an ETF doesn't even grant you voting rights), let's take a look at the ""innovation"" claim.


**Are companies held by the QQQ Fund truly innovative?**


As of market close on Friday, March 25th, the QQQ fund held stock in 101 companies (due to a quirk in Alphabet/Google's share structure, it actually holds 102 different stocks). The holdings can be found [here](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qqq/holdings/). I've split them into categories below (percentages are of total holdings) and given them a very subjective rating of innovation. A couple of general rules of thumb I went by:

* Innovation, in my interpretation of the QQQ commercials, means one of two things: Either ""Something new that changes the industry"" or ""Marked improvement to a current offering that makes it better"". 

* Finding a better way to extract money from customers (ie. turning your product into a software-as-a-service rental) is not innovation in the spirit it's being presented to us.

**Methodology**

I assigned each category an ""Innovation rating"" in which I used my own subjective judgment to assign a rating from 0 to 1 that represents how much I think the company embodies the spirit of ""Innovation"" as the commercials for QQQ present to us (with 1 being ""true innovator"" and 0 being ""no innovation whatsoever). Each category's rating is multiplied by the percentage of the fund's holdings in that category to create a weighted average innovation rating for the QQQ Fund. That number comes out to be **49.27%**. 

* Notes: If you don't like how I've rated companies, make your own post. Also note that the percentages don't *exactly* add up to 100%, the fund holds a little bit of cash as well. Also, you can easily buy stocks in these companies individually. You don't need QQQ to own shares in these companies for you if that's what you want. 

**RATINGS**

**Big, Old Tech Companies** (Innovation rating:.4)

 These companies are the big players in the tech industry. Are they innovators? I give them an innovation rating of .4 as they do create new products regularly, but their main innovations buying up anyone that actually innovates and turning the software industry into an unfortunate hellscape where they collect absurd amounts of data on you to sell, make minimal changes and sell them as a ""new product, or turn their products into ""rental contracts"" that they have all the power over. 

* Apple (12.53%)

* Microsoft (10.06%)

* Google Class A (3.94%)

* Google Class C - No voting rights (3.76%)

* Facebook (3.35%)

* Netflix (1.22%; I almost moved them to the category below as, while they changed an industry, they've clearly lost the first-mover advantage and media consumption is quickly returning to a cable-style landscape where we pay for 50 things we don't want to watch just so we can get the one thing we do want to watch)

* Adobe (1.49%)

* Baidu (0.27%; real big in China)

**Archaic Tech and Telecom Companies** (Innovation rating): 0)

While these are tech companies, they operate on old business models and haven't done anything new for over a decade, thus I can't abide calling them ""innovators"". Mostly they get by on being the biggest (or only accessible) provider of their service. Anyone creating an online retailer or auction service gets put in this category as the timeframe for calling that ""innovation"" has long passed

* Amazon (7.35%; Amazon has grown so large and conglomerated that it's hard to categorize, and there are some decently innovative tech offerings like AWS, but for the most part the ""innovation"" that Amazon does is something someone else does first that is either copied or acquired by Amazon)

* Ebay (0.25%)

* Sirius XM (0.19%)

* AirBnB (0.46%)

* Charter Communications (0.71% heard of Spectrum?)

* T Mobile (1.15%; I might be a little unfair putting them in this category, but the very-consolidated telecom industry as a whole has shown that innovation is nowhere near its primary focus)

* Comcast (1.55%)

* Booking Holdings (0.68%; heard of priceline.com?)

* Mercado Libre (0.46%)

* JD.com (0.27%)

* Copart (0.22%; specifically deals with selling cars through online auctions)

* Pinduoduo (0.15%)


**Computer Hardware, Network Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity** (Innovation rating: .9)

By far the biggest category in terms of number of companies, this catch-all category represents tech companies that exist by staying ahead of the curve. In the case of cybersecurity firms, it's because they contractually have to, but most of the companies here would easily fall by the wayside if they quit innovating (at least until Covid put a bottleneck in semiconductors and chip manufacturing). I could easily split this into smaller categories, but they'd score similar ratings in my very subjective system

* NVidia (4.37%)

* AMD (1.44%)

* Cisco Systems (1.66%)

* Verisign (0.17%)

* Intel (1.54%)

* Broadcom (1.88%)

* Qualcomm (1.31%)

* Texas Instruments (1.25%; they do a lot more than make calculators!)

* Applied Materials (0.90%)

* Micron Technology (0.64%)

* Analog Devices (0.63%)

* Lam Research (0.57%)

* Marvell Technology (0.46%)

* Palo Alto Networks (0.45%)

* ASML Holdings (0.42%)

* KLA Corporation (0.40%)

* Fortinet (0.40%)

* NXP Semiconductors (0.37%)

* Synopsys (0.37%)

* Crowdstrike Holdings (0.34%)

* Cadence Design Systems (0.33%)

* Microchip Technology (0.32%)

* ZScaler (0.24%)

* Skyworks Solutions (0.17%)

**Business and Financial Tech** (Innovation Rating: .7)

These companies fulfill some tech need of businesses. I give them a somewhat high innovation rating as most have transformed some aspect of business over the last decade, but the score suffers as sometimes the changes are either faulty, unwelcome, or just plain arbitrary, and they're frequently the target of customer complaints

* Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (0.67%)

* Zoom Video Communications (0.21%)

* PayPal (0.99%)

* Fiserv (0.47%)
 
* Cognizant Technology Solutions (0.35%)

* Workday (0.35%; ""cloud based human capital management"" sounds pretty dystopian, doesn't it?)

* Paychex (0.34%)

* Atlassian (0.30%; a company that does ""software for software developers"", I almost put them in the Big, Old Tech group because, while coming up with the fairly popular Jira 20 years ago, they spent most of the past decade buying up other innovations without coming up with any of their own)

* Datadog (.29%)

* Verisk Analytics (0.25%)

* Splunk (0.17%)

* Okta, Inc. (0.16%)

* Docusign (0.15%)

**Innovation Companies** (Innovation rating: 1)

Non-Biotech companies that provide a new class of product. Strangely, they're either electric vehicles or medical equipment

* Tesla (4.62%)

* Lucid Motors (0.32%)

* Intuitive Surgical (0.74%)

* Dexcom (0.33%)

* Align Technology (0.25%)


**Retailers** (Innovation rating: 0)

Old companies that exist to sell other companies products. Pretty self-explanatory why the innovation rating here is a big fat zero

* Costco (1.81%)

* O'Reilley Automotive (0.34%)

* Wallgreens Boots Alliance (0.30%)

* Dollar Tree (0.26%)

* Ross Stores (0.23%)

**Food and Beverage** (Innovation Rating: .05)

Mostly old companies that get by on flagship products that have been around longer than most of us have been alive. Avoids the 0 by occasionally creating something new

* PepsiCo (1.67%)

* Starbucks (0.73%)

* Mondelez International (0.62%)

* Keurig Dr. Pepper (0.39%)

* Kraft Heinz (0.35%)

* Monster Beverage (0.30%)

**Non-IT infrastructure** (Innovation rating: .7)

These companies represent ""things that get built"" that aren't computer related. Buildings, aircraft, materials, they all find themselves here. The relatively high innovation rating represents a lot of innovating that we don't see

* Honeywell (0.98%)

* CSX Corporation (0.59%)

* Autodesk (0.34%; included here because, even though it's a software company, it's a major part of this industry)

* Ansys (0.20%; included here for the same reasons as Autodesk)

* Old Dominion Freight Line (0.27%)

* Fastenal Company (0.24%)

* PACCAR (0.23%)

**BioTech** (Innovation rating: 1)

Companies in this area either find new products or cease to exist. A true ""innovate or die"" world, though if a company is big enough it can ""innovate"" by acquiring the real innovators or providing the infrastructure for the real innovators to scale up

* Amgen (0.97%) 

* Gilead Sciences (0.54%)

* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (0.53%)

* Moderna (0.53%)

* Vertex Pharmaceuticals (0.47%)

* Illumina (0.39%)

* IDEXX Laboratories (0.33%; this company focuses on veterinary applications)

* AstraZeneca (0.28%)

* Biogen (0.23%)

* Seagen (0.19%)

**Financial services and Tax preparation** (Innovation rating: -.5)

I've separated this company out and given it a negative innovation rating, as the company is known for lobbying against updating the process of filing taxes, which I consider to be an anti-innovative practice 

* Intuit (0.97%)

**Video games and Dating** (.4)

The real innovative players in this field are much smaller companies, but occasionally one of these shows a flash of brilliance 

* Activision Blizzard (0.45%)

* Electronic Arts (0.26%)

* Match Group (0.22%; you'd be surprised how many dating services are all owned by this one company!)

* NetEase (0.14%; in addition to being a video game developer, Wikipedia states ""The company also owns several pig farms."")

**Hotels** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Nothing innovative about a hotel

* Marriot International (0.41%)

**Utilities** (Innovation rating: .2)

While improvements in power generation exist, the utility companies aren't innovative in the way the QQQ commercials would have you believe

* American Electric Power (.36%)

* Exelon (0.32%)

* XCel Energy (0.28%)

* Constellation Energy (0.13%)




**Non-Tech Business Support** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Founded as a laundry company, Cintas provides laundry services, restroom supplies, low-level medical supplies, and PPE to businesses

* Cintas (0.31%)

**Clothing** (Innovation Rating: .05)

The only actual clothing maker on the list, Lululemon survives off of one (admittedly pretty industry-changing) innovative thought made 20 years ago

* Lululemon Athletica (0.29%)",2022-03-26,15,30

In late February, with Tesla trading near $800 I highlighted how options had been underpricing the stock’s large swings since its parabolic breakout in Oct ’21:

>*Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves.

Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls. Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops.*

In the past two weeks, TSLA made a low near $760 (a double bottom from late February) and rallied with the broader market last week to close above $900 on Friday. That move to the upside was about the move options were pricing for March (with a week remaining) and implied volatility was lower on the move higher. However, the entirety of its move from $760 to nearly $910 came in the span of just a few days.

IV is lower and the stock is not seeing the large upside skew to high vol out of the money calls than it did during its moves higher at the end of 2021. Options are pricing about a 5% move this week and about 11.5% out to April 22nd:

About me: I’m 33 working for a major metropolitan fire department. I’ll retire at 60.5 years old with a small pension (estimated 38k in todays money)

I have a 457b Roth that I’m paying around 4K a year into and a Roth IRA that I max every year. My 457 is managed for me but I manage my IRA. When I retire I’ll have a DROP, where I’ll work my last 5 years and the city will pay my pension into a saving account that builds 7 year treasury note interest per year. My drop will be roughly $200k. I will also be able to cash out up to 600 hours of vacation, roughly $25k. 

My goal is to retire to the Florida keys. I am building my IRA into a dividend account (hence posting here). I’m on year 3 with a yield on cost of 4.1%. I want to build a sizable dividend portfolio by dripping to where I can live comfortably off of a pension that will always pay out, and a dividend portfolio where I never touch my nest egg. 

Presently my largest holdings are QQQ at 9% which is trailed by SCHD at 8%.

I hold multiple dividend ETFs, but find myself light on tech, which is why QQQ is my top holding.  I’m still only weighted 8% in tech, with my highest sectors being financials at 21% and healthcare at 11%. 

QQQ has beaten TDV over the last 5 years, but TDV has won out in the last year. QQQ has been a world beater for quite some time, but is that run coming to an end? I don’t think that the QQQ will fail but I think it might be more inline with VOO and VTI going forward instead of wiping the floor with them. 

What do you hold, why, and what do you suggest for me. 

I always do my due diligence, but part of that is screaming into the void that is Reddit and seeing if I get opinions or angles I never thought of. Thanks all",2022-03-02,0,14

*“TSLA stock finished 2021 at around $1060, in the middle of a range for the final 2 months that saw highs above $1200 and a low just below $900. Tesla is set to report earnings the last week of January. Options are not pricing movement outside of that recent high or low until February. Here’s how that range translates into a $25 wide Iron Condor expiring Feb 18th, about a $1400 risk to $1000 reward profile (via Options AI):*“

&#x200B;

TSLA made a big move higher right to the 1200 level to start last week. It failed there and pulled back sharply from that level and actually finished lower on the week overall. With the stock now $1027 its expected move for this week is roughly 6%, with consensus levels around 1090 and 960, and the expected move out to February 18th about 15%, with consensus levels around 1180 and 870.

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week 2.3% lower (or about $11). That was more than the 1.3% (or $6) options were pricing for the week. Implied volatility was higher to end the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.5% move (about $7 in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY $460 that is a range of about $453 to $467.

* QQQ **2.1%** (about $8)

* DIA **1.6%** (about $6)

Implied volatility is higher than average entering a shortened holiday week and year-end. If volume falls and market moves quiet, options premium may quickly contract into three-day weekends as market makers protect against theta risk. If large day-to-day market moves continue the three-day weekend just adds to the uncertainty and options volatility could see large moves higher and lower corresponding to equity moves.

IWM (Russell 2000 etf) has been in a range for most of 2021 with a failed breakout in November. It has been testing the lower end of that range as recently as Friday. The expected move in IWM into year end is about $9, which to the downside would mean a breakdown below its 2021 range, the bullish expected move of about $225 would put IWM right back in in the middle of that range:

rg1wxr_QQQ,QQQ,Purchasing an ETF (QQQ) vs Escrow account,"I'm about to re-fi for a lower rate and this time around, I think I want to forego an escrow account and purchase the same amount in QQQ.

My property taxes and insurance totals $535 a month for my escrow to have a tiny surplus at the end of the year. My home owners insurance just informed me they're increasing the premium by about $150 a year. 

**El Plan**: I'm going to purchase $550 in QQQ on the first of every month ($550*12=$6600) from 2/1/2022 to 1/30/2023 (property taxes due in TX.)

I looked at a ETF QQQ calculator. Every year, for the past 10 years, it would win, with varying profits of $200 for a particular year to $1700 for a particular year. Two years, it lost. Biggest loss $500 for that year. 

I also did the math and found it would be slightly more profitable (1-2%) if I made my purchases weekly of $127($127*52=$6600 of QQQ.)

**Where I could be wrong**: I am starting to think about the taxes side of it. Will I get smoked because this money will only be in an account 11 months at a time before starting again after the taxes and insurance is paid? I don't think the IRS is going to eat away at my plan when it's all done each year. ($-500 to $1700)

Also, i am likely going to just grow the account in anticipation for rising property taxes and home values (Insurance seems to go up when value of home rises - go figure.)

**Am I crazy?** I searched and couldn't find much info about doing this. I've seen people do ""high-yield"" accounts, but nothing about purchasing stocks weekly/monthly instead. Bet your ass that the banks and lenders are using the money we put in for escrow to invest anyway.

With most earnings out of the way, markets will likely be focused on macro events and year end positioning for the next few weeks. With last week's quick compression in implied volatility near term options are no longer pricing the wild swings we saw the past few weeks but that could change quickly with any move lower. On the flipside, a stable market into year end might see options compress even more as options need to price in shorter holiday weeks.",2021-12-12,200,49

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week down about half a percent (or $2). That was well inside the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. However, SPY traded in a $15 range and was higher by about $10 and lower by about $5 during the week. Implied volatility was higher on the week with the VIX closing on Friday above 30.

**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 2.4% move (about $11 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY 453.50 that is a range of about 442.50 to 464.50.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 30.50, up from around 28 to start the week. That means expected moves are large (historically) in all the market ETFs, particularly the QQQ and IWM:

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **2.4%** (about $11)
* QQQ **2.9%** (about $11)
* IWM **4.1%** (about $9)
* DIA **2.5%** (about $9)

If the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.

For example: December VIX futures are around 28.50, while Jan and Feb are near 28. May is around 27.50.

Cryptocurrencies sold off over the weekend, particularly **Bitcoin** which is down nearly 30% in the past month. BTC options are pricing about an 8% move for this week and about a 16% into year end.

### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

With market implied volatility high, expected moves for earnings need to price the event itself but also the moves of the market in the days up to and after the earnings itself. In other words, when the VIX is 14 an expected move for earnings is almost entirely made up the event move expectations, when the VIX is 30, it needs to also account for a market that is expected to move by itself.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.9% last week, more than the 1.3% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1% move (or about $4.50 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$446** that corresponds to just above **$450** on the upside and below **$442** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16, down from 19 the week before. The VIX is now below its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping, but January futures were down from last week, now just under 23.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

With implied volatility slightly lower, options are pricing smaller market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs, all slightly lower except the DIA which is about the same as last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **1.6%**
* DIA **1.1%**

As an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $442 and $450 to see Max Gain:

**Last Week –** **SPY** was higher by about 1.9% last week, more than the 1.3% move options were pricing.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1% move (or about $4.50 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around **$446** that corresponds to just above **$450** on the upside and below **$442** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16, down from 19 the week before. The VIX is now below its historical average entering this week. VIX futures remain upward sloping, but January futures were down from last week, now just under 23.

A Debit Put Spread to that level, buying the at-the-money 443 puts and selling a put at the Bearish Expected Move of 413 costs about 8.00 and breaks-even at about 435.

**Last Week –** **SPY** was lower by about 0.5%, inside the 0.7% expected move options were pricing. However, the market was lower mid-week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $444 that corresponds to about **$439** as a *bearish expected move* and **$448** as a *bullish expected move*.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was above 23 during the week, but closed around 18.50 on Friday following the market rally that ended the week. That is about in line with its historical average. The futures curve is upward sloping with December VIX futures around 23, up from 22 last week.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

The market ETFs are all pricing larger moves this week than last week:

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.3%**
* IWM **2.1%**
* DIA **1.3%**

### In the News

The market’s move lower last week saw some demand for option volatility as the VIX quickly spiked towards the mid 20s. With the VIX now back in the teens and VIX December futures near 23, options are pricing about a 7% move by year end.

A Debit Put Spread to that level, buying the at-the-money 443 puts and selling a put at the Bearish Expected Move of 413 costs about 8.00 and breaks-even at about 435. It costs about 1.8% of the underlying but protects against about 5% of the 7% move options are currently pricing. For those looking for portfolio protection, those ratios and breakevens are one way to analyze potential hedges:

I have heard people say that the Nasdaq and technology in general is in a bubble. While you can certainly make a case that it is overvalued, there are some key differences to the tech/dotcom dubble of 2000 that would make it unfair to say that we are that those levels. 

There are definitely tech stocks that show similarities to the stocks that were responsible for 2000 tech crash, such as little to no earnings, pe ratios at 100, 500, or even 1000. But the tech sector and QQQ, which is overweight in tech, is not showing these bubble like characteristics as a whole. Most of these companies are large or mega cap companies with years of solid growth and profitability. Yes, they could very well be overvalued, but investing in overvalued companies or sectors is still reasonable if you buy and hold into them with a long time horizon, while dollar cost averaging. 

The current PE ratio of QQQ is somewhere in the mid 30s. The historical PE ratio of QQQ in March 2000 was 190.",2021-06-24,75,41

npjq8q_CRWD,CRWD,"Cleanest Options Flow from Last Week - Setups going into Next Week - QQQ, CRWD, ARKK, PAGS, ZM, ABNB","I built a bot a couple of weeks ago  that looks at the live options flow all day and finds heavy repeated  flow where a lot of money is being spent. This type of flow can predict  future price activity especially if the contracts are out of the money.  Based on this principle, here are some great plays with cleanest options  flow from this week.

All of these are potential plays that I'll be playing in the next few weeks. Hope folks will find these beneficial both for day trading and swing trading. 

Let's start with **$ZM.**  There were a bunch of puts bought towards 330 and a put bought above  ask for 250 all expiring in the next few months.  There was some  interesting call flow towards 400 but very little.  Play here is 330  puts for July/August.

&#x200B;

**$PAGS** this was my favorite flow that we caught last week. There were tons of 50 calls and a lot of money was being spent on them.  The stock has already gone from 45 to 49 based on the flow we caught. But there seems to be more upside.  Plays is 52.5 September Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1v2c34w9gk271.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c52ecbcbba9cfce0f1de000b212f105935b2e9

**$ABNB** another excellent setup here. There are a few puts here but quite a lot of calls towards 140-150. Clean flow!  The play here is 140-150 calls for August/September.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iraf5tlagk271.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=957850c17a84c0beb5f553b75e4c226980d13b4a

**$CRWD** I believe we have earnings here this week. Risk setup but there's abundant flow towards 230-235 calls.  Play here is to just follow smart money. June 235 calls.

**$ARKK** some heavy puts here + reveral after touching the 50 moving average. We are still in a downtrend so this can also be an excellent hedge play if you are into growth stocks.  Play here is 90-100 puts 2 months out.

**$QQQ** this is a lotto play but there are tons of heavy puts on QQQ last week. I'd buy a few puts far out of the money both as a hedge and as a lotto.  Play here 315 puts for July 16.

**$UBER** final one here. Heavy calls towards 55 strike + clean flow.   Play here is 55 strikes for August 20. Follow the expiration here! Don't go short term.

That's it. Please always do your own DD along with these plays for the best results. Options flow should always be coupled with price action analysis to find the best plays. Also, let me know if this is something the community likes. I can post these every week.

nhrvc0_QQQ,QQQ,How much do locked indexes like QQQ and TQQQ stray from each other?,"I just backtested my TQQQ algobot on QQQ, and was surprised to find that while it has roughly expected returns (about 1/3 of what I was seeing on TQQQ, per trade) it made fairly different trades, and only about half the trades that it made on TQQQ.  All of my logic is based on things like moving averages that should behave the same on the two stocks.

So my question is how exactly are these stocks matched throughout the day?  Is there some divergence that then gets corrected overnight?  How much stray is there?  I'm trading on 1 minute charts, but backtesting by stepping through 1s at a time.",2021-05-21,58,64

Get the feeling we are seeing the old ""unload on to retail"" trick here.  I'm not saying we crash. I'm just saying that my slightly bearish plays of selling Bearish Credit Call Spreads is now leaning to the purchase of some premium with Bearish Put Spreads. So, my plays are going to be more reliant on the QQQ falling to at least the $290 mark soon.

UPDATE 03-31 7:45am .. 15 minute rule .. Got a Credit Spread that expires tomorrow for $75 credit in the 318-320 Bear Call.  Pretty nice risk reward.  Get $75 ,, Most I can lose is $125 if it hits $320 and the most I can gain is the $75-fees if it closes tomorrow Sub $318 .. MaxPain is 315-316 .. 8:00am got another at $93 credit. Bought a third contract at $105 credit. This is all I'm taking here. 75+93+105 = 276/3 = $92 average... Stop loss is $90 if it hits $1.22 credit I'm out. The only trade for today. --- GOT STOPPED OUT

UPDATE 9:15 am ...  STOPPED OUT of this trade as it held $318.15 for too long and that was an area that I had for price rejection today. Get the feeling I got out when I should have got in :)  See what next week brings. Good luck all!

UPDAT 9:33 am.. All I am keeping from this trade is ... 2x 319/320 Bearish Credit Call spreads that expire tomorrow and 1x 318/320 Bearish Credit Call Spreads. This for the QQQ .. Have other positions. The rest is off the table. One thing I really believe in and shorted AMZN @ 3115 is this bell curve would benefit sellers strongly at $3100 or below and especially at $3000 for tomorrow. Will AMZN gap down tomorrow?

# What is priced in FED Land ? 

Nearly a full hike in EOY 22 | 2.3 % Average fed funds over next 30 years | 10/2 at 143 bps which is a level last seen in Dec 2016 which is the peak of the Trump era.  
I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

**YELLEN**   
It would take 2 years at this rate to get back to pre covid u6 (puts us on March 23)

**GS** WITH INFRA /!\\   
the simulation implies 7% Q4/Q4 GDP growth in 2021, a decline in the unemployment rate to 3.7% in 2021Q4 and 3% by 2023Q4, a pickup in core inflation to 2.2% by 2023, and one to two rate hikes in 2023 under our interpretation of the Fed’s new framework. We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

**MS**   
While inflation in the reopening-sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient,a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021 – led by shelter inflation,healthcare services,and a multi-quarter passthrough of dollar weakness into goods. The sustainable inflation impulse intensifies in 2022as cyclically sensitive inflation components start to dominate – based on a tightening labor market and robust levels of demand. Core PCE to peak at 2.3 on DEC 22 !!!!*that TIPS-based breakeven inflation, based on CPI inflation measures, could move considerably higher and still be consistent with a PCE inflation outcome modestly above the 2% target.”*

**My own Conclusion** If you assume no infra or an infra bill that is close to entirely paid for via additional taxes and has a low multiplier we are definitely slightly above fair value in terms of rates. The Fed into FOMC next week WILL not assume an infra bill or its implications within the SEP thus in this case it is still possible to have a SEP that shows **no HIKE in 2023** So I cannot help but be bullish duration (& implications, see title) into FOMC March 16 and Auctions March 11 However - **Progress on infra / Data points indicating or suggesting faster path to min u6 will be hawkish EuroDollars (& implications)**   
I DO Believe there will be progress on an infra bill that will be generally expansionary in the end - thus the real trend is still an increase in real rates / ED and the implications that come with it : \* Gold down / \* TXN down / \* Dollar up vs EUR,CHF,Yen / \*NQ valuation down / \*Banks up / \*Value > Growth / But there should be a respite as we’ve already had strong progress in this direction and   
a) we will get a FED that, by ignoring the infra bill, will be able to push back VERY strongly through the SEP   
b) We are hearing stories of Manchin refusing to use fillibuster (which would make the infra bill A LOT Less exciting)   
How to trade this then ? Clearly, the real solution is to sell puts on NQ expiring soon to buy puts expiring later (apply that to all the other asset classes)

**Super monkey trade : Sell near term QQQ/GLD/TLT puts to buy longer term ones.**",2021-03-09,73,52

ldu6mz_QQQ,QQQ,Thinking about putting money in SPY and QQQ,"So I made some money from a recently popular stock. Right now I have 320k.

I saw some people talking about SPY and QQQ on this sub yesterday and I looked them up. 

So if I had put 150k into SPY and another 150K into QQQ I would have made over 15k in gains from the previous month. That's more than what I make at my day job. 

With the remaining 20k I wanna put 10k into my savings and use 10k to learn how to trade stocks like you guys do. I don't know anything about investing lol. 

So my question is, is it really that simple? I feel like I'm missing something and it can't be that simple. So set aside say 50% of the gains for taxes? 

Look I make 60k a year at my current job that I absolutely hate and it's killing my body. Can this be my chance to go back to school and live off of the monthly gains? I have very minimal bills. My house and car are paid off. 80% of my check post taxes goes into savings. I live a very boring life. 

So what am I missing in this equation if I put that money into SPY and QQQ? Do they act like normal stocks where I just sell however many shares whenever I need some cash each month?",2021-02-06,31,49

If you search on google for the keyword [**Candlestick Patterns**](https://www.google.com/search?q=candlestick+patterns),  I am quite certain that you will find a plethora of posts and videos  talking about hundreds of different candlestick patterns with very  complex names. From spinning tops to shooting stars, every single type   of candlestick will have a pattern associated with it. I have never  personally understood the reasoning behind giving such complex names to  these patterns. After having read about 20 books on technical analysis  and price action, I have an unpopular opinion that these names do not  matter, and same is the case with a vast majority of candlestick  patterns. I spend most of my time in a day reading charts and I can  assure you that I don't remember more than 2 or 3 candlestick patterns  by their names. The reason I wanted to write this blog post is to change  this culture of drilling these patterns into retail traders without  explaining why they work. There so many charlatans that claim of being  technical analysis experts and charge thousands of dollars. Having done  thousands of backtests over the last 20 years, I can assure you with  100% confidence that relying on any single technical indicator or  candlestick pattern will never work in the long run. Despite that, these  patterns are still good to have in your arsenal because they can  sometimes help infer and predict price action. Let us go over some  candlestick patterns and try to understand why they work. But before  that, for new traders, we need to define what a candlestick is.

## A Candlestick

Looking at [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/), this is the definition of a [candlestick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) that we find.

>A candlestick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis  that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a  specific period.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xs293m5f0o761.png?width=1757&format=png&auto=webp&s=39eb22284fb144e3ceddd526c873986077867848

Candlesticks are important because they show us the battle of bulls and  bears. If a price opens lower and ends up higher (green candle), that  depicts that bulls are in control. Similarly, if the price opens lower,  goes up very high but eventually closes lower as well, that means bulls  tries to take control but bears defeated them. This is how I believe  everyone should think about candlestick patterns. You will realize that  having this type of thinking will help you understand these patterns  instead of simply cramming their names and looking for them everywhere.  Now that we have created a simple framework that we are going to use,  let us go over some examples to drill this deep into your minds. Before  we go to the section, it is pertinent that you always remember the  importance of risk management when you are learning technical analysis  and candlestick patterns. In your trading career, you will find out that  most of these patterns only work about half the time or less. When they  don't work, you need to have good risk management to get out of bad  positions. Risk management is the holy grail of trading. Please do not  forget that.

## Battles of Bulls and Bears

## [TSLA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=TSLA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8349r1ie0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d89a6b2ea4978416cdafe4b898ad9a2fbe60d4

Instead of naming different candlestick patterns, we are going to do  something different here. We are going to look at a few charts and see  if there are any patterns that can illustrate how the battle between  bulls and bears worked out.

There are four instances in this chart where a good battle took place  between bears and bulls. In the first instance, we can see that the  price was rallying for a few days. However, on November 27th, 2020, the  price started low, went up very high but ended up very low as well. That  tells us that bulls were in control at one point in the day but bears  took control and defeated bulls thus closing the price close to the low  of the day. In the next few days, we can see a reversal happen. On the  next three instances, we observed a very similar pattern. Digressing a  bit here, there's a great quotation, ""Price has memory"" that you need to  remember. If a certain patter/type of battle keeps appearing on a  chart, it has a much higher probability of panning out as compared to  one-time battle.

On points 2, 3, and 4, we can see that we had a short term downtrend  and the bears tried to make the trend continue. However, bulls took over  and brought the price from a very low to either a middle ground or  close to the high of the day. In the following days, we can see  reversals happening

## [HD Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=HD)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dohldhwd0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=8708bec4efd15c26fc222b1d57273c0b3d6f2d6f

So many things to learn from this chart. Let us start with point number  1 where we saw what folks call a ""Bearish Engulfing Candle"". In layman  terms, that simply means that the bears were able to get the price down  to ever lower the low of the previous day all the way from the top.  People call this an engulfing candle because it sort of engulfs the  previous candle. Sometimes, these candles can start a new short term  trend as we can see here. After the engulfing by bears, the price went  down.

The second point is actually very interesting and one of the higher  probability setups you will find. When price continues to go in a trend  for a long period of time before we see a candle where the opposite  party completely defeats the trending party, we usually see a reversal  from there. That is exactly what you see after point number 2. The  reason this happened was because bulls had tried their hard to get the  price up but bears were dominating and made the price go to the very low  of the candle. I do not want to name these candles a lot but people  usually call this an inverted hammer. Again, as you can now see, no one  should really remember the names as there are so many. Once you  understand what happens, it's easy to spot patterns.

Points 3, 4, and 5 are very similar and goes back to finding similar  setups on a chart to increase probabilities. There were three times when  the price was going in a downtrend before we got an indecision candle  or a candle where bears were exhausted and bulls took over. After all  such candles, we saw a reversal.

## [MRNA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=MRNA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h1we3bfd0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00b690f54f33e729c04e700dfe0b63e4786fe3c

With Moderna, we again see two bearish candles that engulfed the  previous bullish candles. After the first candle, we immediately had an  indecision candle where bulls and bears could not decide what to do.  However, we had another engulfing candle at point 2 that started a  downtrend. One thing to note here is that on a larger timeframe such as a  weekly chart, the first engulfing candle would be enough to see that it  started a longer term downtrend. After that candle, the price has never  gone above the high of the candle. This is how we can gauge bullish and  bearish pressure based on different candles to see if we should go long  or short on a stock.

## [QQQ Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=QQQ)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0xcylfxc0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0add93777473c0718865e3966c0c2d33f3bfad

Indices are slightly hard to trade solely based on candlestick  patterns. However, we can see some pretty clear ones here that I wanted  to discuss. The first two patterns were candles where bulls wanted to  continue their run but bears defeated them getting the price close to  the low of the candles. That initiated a short term downtrend.

The third is an interesting point where we again saw a bearish  engulfing which started a slightly longer term downtrend. There are many  small patterns after this candle such as an indecision green candle  that started an uptrend, a hammer like candle that was a fake  candlestick because the uptrend continued. Hammer like candlesticks are  usually thought of as reversal patterns but they can also be thought of  as bulls defeating the bears and price can potentially continue higher,  which it did here.

Finally, the fourth point is again a hammer like candlestick that led  to a big reversal. As I said previously, hammer like candles are mostly  used to find reversals. But since the price went down and eventually  came back, it also sometimes shows that bullish pressure is still there.  The reason most people use them as reversal signals is that it gives us  a sign of caution because there was a time when bears were able to get  the price to the very low of the candle. Although bulls defeated bears  for that particular candle, just the indication of bearish pressure is  sometimes enough to infer a reversal.

## [BA Daily Chart](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=BA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iqrflac0o761.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=8246cecf6af6f0a6e4a5a5f7c2740d40a5be2e1b

When you start finding candlestick patterns on charts, one thing you  will realize is that there are many fakeouts i.e patterns that don't pan  out immediately or don't pan out at all. There are many theories behind  why this happens. One reason is that since most people know that retail  traders are going to follow these patterns, they fake them to create  liquidity in the market because people immediately start buying and  selling on these patterns. Another reason is that these patterns are  just not universal. They can show the battle between bulls and bears but  new events, news, and other things come up that can affect that  pressure.

In Boeing's chart, we can see that we had a huge indecision candle  where bulls and bears could not decide which way to go. After a good up  or downtrend, an indecision is a sign of reversal because the trending  party is losing momentum. That is what we would have expected there but  look at the large green candle the next day, which was a fake candle.  After that, the price indeed started to go in a downtrend.

## Final Thoughts

That is it. This was a short introduction to how retail traders should  go about looking at candlesticks to gauge bullish and bearish pressure. I  personally learned this way of looking at candlesticks from this  amazing book by Alexander Elder called [The New Trading for a Living](https://www.amazon.com/New-Trading-Living-Psychology-Discipline/dp/1118443926).  The book goes into length on many things we have discussed in this  post. Please note that I have no affiliation with the author.

Finally, I would like to urge retail traders to spend time learning to  read price action because it is an important skill to have in your  arsenal. People forget that almost all technical indicators are simply  extensions of price action since they are calculated based on the price  and volume. Therefore, if you understand the tension between bulls and  bears well, you will not need any technical indicators. Most of the  examples we see in this post are also on daily charts. The same  principles hold for weekly charts, intraday charts, or any other time  period.",2020-12-27,89,18

k0dzub_NIO,NIO,"[+$1119.39] - 11/24 Trade Review w/ Pics! - TSLA, CGC, NIO, QQQ","Hey r/Daytrading! I thought I would continue my [trend from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/jztlil/1123_trade_review_w_pics_baba_pltr_sq_snap_roku/) of posting my trades and my reasoning behind them while on vacation this week. All trades are entered off of the 2m & 5m time frame (I watch both). The 1m charts in some screenshots are for entry clarity. Stops are at the most recent low on the 2m and then are moved up to subsequent higher lows on the 2m or 5m. Occasionally the bottoms of candles are used if the R:R isn't good enough to use the low. Feel free to leave questions for critiques.

&nbsp;

**TSLA (+$444.5)**

Ticker was at ATHs pre-market and anytime a hype ticker is coming off of ATHs I look to play a bounce when it first hits 5m oversold. 

The 2nd trade was just looking for a higher low on the 15m. I played a smaller position size because while visually TSLA was in the right spot QQQ was at the HOD. I would have been more comfortable if QQQ was also going for a 15m HL.

You can also see in the pic that I closed out 1 share of a 5 share swing position from $435.95 at $540.75 pre-market.  This swing was entered the day after the big gap up off of news TSLA was getting added to the S&P. I closed 2 shares yesterday pre-market so I'm still holding 2. I posed the inital flipping I did to get a good cost basis.

**NIO (+$512.54)**

Same setup as TSLA. Ticker was at ATHs pre-market. There was a nice double bottom on the 2m with 5m & 15m RSI oversold.

Scaled out and then went short after a break over $55 with no follow through. I covered pretty quick to be protective as I was still bullish on the ticker and then went long for a 5m higher low attempt. I took profit on 1/2 of that position when it moved up and was stopped out of the 2nd half shortly after for a roughly breakeven trade for that last one.

**CGC (-284.16)**

Ticker broke resistance on the weekly shortly after the open on increasing bull volume so I was super interested in getting in on any sort of pullback. I was stopped out 3 times on this one, the last time right at the bottom. As a personal rule I will usually only make 2 attempts at a trade like this but I made a 3rd as the guy who runs the trading group I'm in mentioned he was entering. He has a stupid high winrate so I typically make note of or copy his positions if it's a ticker I'm already playing. 

1st attempt was for a bull flag possibility and front running 27 psychological support. I was stopped out for -$50 or so. 

2nd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the .5 fib level and I was stopped out again for around -$50

3rd entry attempt was off a green 2m candle near the 0.618 fib level. I had my stop at 26.29... so of course it bounced at 26.27 for -$180ish. In hindsight I question entering at this low of a fib level even if a 5m lower high is still the most likely scenario. Not bouncing before the 0.5 fib doesn't matchup with the super bullish signs the ticker was showing off of the open.

**QQQ (+$446.51)**

Went long with a little starter position after NQ started threatening to break bull out of the 4h EQ. I entered the rest of the shares I had planned on scaling into if it had pulled back from where I first entered of off a 5m HL. I took profit when the 1h chart started to get over extended and it looked like it was due for consolidation. On this sort of breakout I'd normally look to swing some of the position but I've already got an open MNQ swing from around 11200.

**Last Week**

Options prices started last week pricing in a possible big move lower in the indices. When that didn't come to fruition (actual moves finished the week much smaller than expected moves) volatility compressed a bit:

* VIX closed Friday at 26.87, down on the week (from the low 30's).
* Last week's expected move in SPY: 2.8%
* Last week’s actual move SPY: -1.0%
* Last week's expected move in QQQ: 4.6%
* Last week's actual move in QQQ: -0.8%

**This Week**

Note the smaller expected moves for this week, despite the fact that last week had one less day of trading:

[IB Simulated Example](https://prnt.sc/qmspui0

Hello, I've been thinking about ways to protect my long call gambling habit from a market-wide correction.

After farting around for a bit, I ended up with a QQQ $225/$230 MAR20 Call Debit Spread + QQQ $209 Long Put. Has a P/L like a Put Back Spread, though doesn't require collateral. Debit isn't cheap, but the ""upside"" is huge and the ""downside"" is a wash.

I imagine there is already a name for this spread, and the fact I can't find it anywhere makes me think it is probably a pretty dumb trade as a hedge.

Would anyone be able to tell me what's wrong with this play? I wouldn't consider it a bet against the Bull, just a suck cost for insurance.

So this week was way quieter than last one. Not many stocks hit my screener, lower activity among volatile penny stocks was noticed on Thursday and Friday.

$ANY
So many people follow this stock and are interested in trading/investing in it. But be aware while the technical trend is bearish (very usual among micro cap stocks), the company completed reverse split which is not the best sign from fundamental perspective while most of the time companies are doing this to comply with Exchanges' listing rules. Postive aspect about this stocks is that it won the contract from North Alabama University for its product.

$YUMA
No news, no nothing, just speculative move up. It can stay at these levels for a week or two but if there is no real fundamental reason behind the stock price movement it probably after wandering around at these levels will head back down.

$TEUM
Again big volatile moves and some ""positive"" news on July 11 which if you read the title carefully would not provide much reason to be very interested in the company (news article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pareteum-sets-q2-2017-results-120000950.html).
Then we got reality check which was provided by another article again on yahoo.finance (news article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pareteum-granted-extension-nyse-mkt-142800714.html). So it looks like the company is still not regaining its compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements. This was the moment I got the idea that under the micro cap stocks sun nothing has changed and you should be aware and do your own due diligence and read between the line so not to get screwed by poor investment/trading decision made based solely because of some PR stunt.

Hope you had great rest and good luck, next week is already here.
