(RCL) has delivered an outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024, exceeding expectations and achieving its Trifecta targets ***18 months ahead of schedule***. The company‚Äôs unwavering focus on executing its proven formula of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, and strong cost discipline has propelled it to new heights, positioning it for continued success in the rapidly growing $1.9 trillion vacation market.

# Financials

In the second quarter of 2024, Royal Caribbean reported total revenues of $4.11 billion, a significant increase from $3.52 billion in the same period of 2023. This growth was driven by a 18.1% increase in passenger ticket revenues to $2.89 billion, as well as a 13.3% rise in onboard and other revenues to $1.22 billion. The company‚Äôs strong performance was underpinned by a 4.5% increase in capacity, which contributed $109 million to the growth in passenger ticket revenues, as well as a 3.2% increase in occupancy and higher ticket prices on a per passenger basis.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, Royal Caribbean reported total revenues of $7.84 billion, up from $6.41 billion in the same period of 2023. Passenger ticket revenues for the six-month period increased by 25% to $5.43 billion, driven by a 6.9% increase in capacity and a 4.0% increase in occupancy, coupled with higher ticket prices.

The company‚Äôs robust demand environment has also translated into higher revenue and earnings expectations for the balance of the year. Royal Caribbean is now forecasting full-year net yield growth of 10.4% to 10.9%, up from its previous guidance, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $11.35 and $11.45, representing a 68% year-over-year increase.

**Cost Discipline and Margin Expansion**

Royal Caribbean‚Äôs success is not limited to its top-line performance. The company has also demonstrated strong cost discipline, with total cruise operating expenses increasing by $197 million, or 10.1%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the 4.5% capacity expansion and higher drydock and maintenance-related expenses. For the six-month period, total cruise operating expenses increased by $462 million, or 12.3%, largely due to the 6.9% capacity expansion and higher ticket prices, drydock costs, and commissions and head taxes.

The company‚Äôs focus on operational efficiency has enabled it to achieve significant margin expansion. In the second quarter of 2024, Royal Caribbean‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, up from 33.2% in the same period of 2023. For the six-month period, the company‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.8%, compared to 28.3% in the first half of 2023.

**Geographic Diversification**

Royal Caribbean‚Äôs geographic diversification has also been a key driver of its success. In the second quarter of 2024, the company‚Äôs North American itineraries, which account for approximately 79% of its passenger ticket revenues, saw a 18.1% increase in revenues compared to the same period in 2023. The Asia-Pacific region also contributed to the company‚Äôs strong performance, with revenues from this market increasing by 39.1% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The European region maintained its performance from the previous year.

**Onboard Revenue Performance**

The company‚Äôs onboard and other revenues, which comprise approximately 30% of its total revenues, have also been a standout performer. In the second quarter of 2024, onboard and other revenues increased by 13.3% to $1.22 billion, driven by a 3.2% increase in occupancy and improved pricing. For the six-month period, onboard and other revenues grew by 16.5% to $2.41 billion, benefiting from the 6.9% capacity expansion and higher pricing.

**Liquidity**

Royal Caribbean‚Äôs strong liquidity position has also been a key enabler of its success. As of June 30, 2024, the company had $3.8 billion in liquidity, including $391 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion in undrawn revolving credit facility capacity. This robust financial position has allowed the company to reinstate a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, reflecting its confidence in the business and its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

# Outlook

Looking ahead, Royal Caribbean remains focused on executing its proven formula for success. The company‚Äôs pipeline of new ships, including the highly anticipated Icon-class and Edge-class vessels, as well as the continued development of its private destinations, such as the Royal Beach Club in the Bahamas and Cozumel, Mexico, are expected to drive further growth and differentiation in the market.

Furthermore, the company‚Äôs strategic initiatives, such as the launch of its enterprise loyalty status match program and the ongoing integration of its brands, are designed to deepen its relationships with customers and enhance their vacation experiences. These efforts, combined with the company‚Äôs commitment to sustainability and its industry-leading decarbonization efforts, position Royal Caribbean as a formidable player in the global vacation market.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. has delivered an exceptional performance in the second quarter of 2024, exceeding expectations and achieving its Trifecta targets ahead of schedule. The company‚Äôs robust demand environment, strong cost discipline, and strategic initiatives have enabled it to drive significant margin expansion and position itself for continued success in the rapidly growing vacation market. With a strong liquidity position, a pipeline of innovative new offerings, and a relentless focus on delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly, Royal Caribbean is well-positioned to capitalize on the vast opportunities ahead and deliver long-term value for its shareholders.

1bp7e3y_RCL,RCL,When will $RCL Royal Caribbean reinstate their dividend?,"Full disclosure:  I am pretty heavy on Royal Caribbean in my portfolio.  This is mainly due to the fact that I was probably one of the only ""insane"" people to really strengthen my position in the stock when it was $45 during covid and freefalling.

I originally bought the stock 8 years ago because it was my personal favorite cruise line and it had an attractive dividend payout.  When Covid hit the world, they removed the dividend to stay afloat obviously.  Now, the stock is at its ATH and I believe in it more than ever with the decisions the company has made to invest in the largest sized class of cruise liners.  I also believe they will be the first cruise company to move into AI and automation to improve all aspects on board.

So my question is, when do y'all think they will reinstate that dividend payout or is it gone forever?  Not sure if other companies have gone through this as well and brought back the dividend?",2024-03-27,0,9

You might remember me from such hits as knowing exactly where each GME weekly was going to end up, getting people out of SNDL before it collapsed, and starting a $RIOT before it was cool, warning you to get out of PLTR at 39, amongst others.  Today I want to have a more...gentle...conversation with you.  Let's talk about cruise stonks.

&#x200B;

# Wayne's World Flashback Humming

Picture it:  It's 2020.  The air is crisp with winter in the air, you're blowing your student loans on the latest iPhone, and your parents have decided to spend some of your inheritance on a 10 day Caribbean cruise because they're tired of shoveling snow, and you ended up being their greatest disappointment, anyways so why should they leave you some money?  So you could go blow it all on some SPY FD puts?  Screw that.  Carnival ($CCL) was sitting at about $42 a share, $NCLH was at $52, $RCL at $115.  Everything in the world was in its place.

&#x200B;

Then mom and dad called you frantically to let you know that there was a bioattack upon the ship, originating somewhere around the shuffleboard area.  Everybody was dying and the army wasn't letting them off the ship.  They wanted to let you know that they loved you...but that they, too, had been buying SPY FD puts and had lost the rest of your inheritance and were waiting for the right time to tell you.  Things were looking really grim.

&#x200B;

As we all know, predictably, when the world shut down, the cruise stonks got positively crushed.  Turns out having $0 in revenue is bad for stonk price.  Who knew?  But should they stay there?  Is there no longer a business model for beyond-middle-aged white people that want to spend a couple of weeks pretending they're ""alive"" as they partake in an entirely on-the-rails kiddie bumper adventure?

&#x200B;

# Back to the present

Advance bookings say otherwise as Boomers make a recreational bet on ""return to normal"".  Take Norwegian, for example:  They're advance bookings for 2021 is actually \*ahead of\* where they were in 2019 in spite of extending their global sailing boycott all the way to \*\*next May\*\*.  Royal Caribbean and Carnival both state that their 2021 bookings are back to exactly on par where they were before all this madness about spicy flu happened.  And these are just the people who are willing to fork over money right now that AREN'T afraid of the scamdem...oops, I mean...well...you know.  Just wait until everybody gets emboldened by their plot armo...I mean vaccinations.  More tellingly, the vast majority of people who were booked on canceled cruises, when given the choice between refunds or rollovers, chose rollovers.  Dumb move since money now is better than money later, but just another sign that we're all in a virtual simulation of Idiocracy.  Run with it.  Now add in the fact that, as we open up, people will be positively DESPERATE to go do something - ANYTHING - that's not in their house that they will positively crush any and all entertainment options - especially travel.  So, in a way, this DD could actually apply to stonks like Cedar & Six Flags or Disney or...whoever sells ""fun"", depending on what your definition of that is.  Thanks to the K-shaped recovery, most people in this country are sitting on a pile of extra cash they're just waiting to blow on an enhanced vacation package of some sort.

&#x200B;

But let's look under the hood for a moment, shall we?  The reason these 3 lines were able to stave off bankruptcy is threefold:  1, they all raised debt to create liquidity. That's generally bad, but since the Fed has been a free money printing machine for a while, they got some fantastic interest rates for that debt.  Matter of fact, 2 of the 3 of them used that new debt to pay off older, higher interest debt, then took out new new debt to make up the difference.  2, they all issued shares and created a small amount of dilution (though, in the case of Carnival, they were in the middle of a stock buyback when this all happened, so they basically ended up re-issuing the shares they had bought.  Bad for short term balance sheets, but long term lesser impact), and 3, they've been locked out of COVID related relief packages till now, which means their turn in the queue is widely viewed as coming up for their shot at free money roulette.  At present, it's looking like about a quarter billion dollars to them to bail them out.  They've already been able to shift their portage losses directly to the ports in question, so they saved some cash there, as well.

&#x200B;

So, using some napkin math and Yamazaki logic, the only thing preventing these cruise lines from going right back to where they were before all this happened is if they find themselves in a credit crunch, as the data shows that they will return to normal capacity operations in time.  So let's take a look at cash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the chart above, I took the liberty of adding $CUK, which is Carnival's ""other"" stonk.  Really, understanding this group, I guess I should have listed that one as the primary so you feel more comfortable about it as you listen to your wife get railed by her boyfriend.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

OK, so how much are they burning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah, all you know exactly what this looks like - nobody knows better than WSB how to look at loss porn, and these cruise lines have a lot of it.  The gist here is that Carnival and Norwegian are probably fine financially for at least another year with no new income (and they have debt they haven't accessed yet at their disposal).  Royal Caribbean is in a little bit of a tighter spot, as they're going to have to go to the banks for money in the next 6 months barring a government bailout.  Norwegian is in a particularly envious position, because their debt levels are already lower than everybody else's and some of their smaller subsidiaries are going to be setting sail on those river cruises earlier, which will staunch their bleeding as Europe re-opens.

&#x200B;

Now, because I know all you retards love talking about shorts and what not, let's take a look at what Wall Street thinks of these stonks.  If they're going bankrupt, they're going to lean their chipstack in on them, right?

The smart money started piling in just before Christmas.  That's about when I got in on 2 of these, as well.  But I felt it was an aggressive move at the time.  Especially since we were missing a lot of vaccination data as well as any forward guidance from these companies.  They've since clarified their stance, and the vaccination data shows that we were already going to be rolling out a million doses a day, in spite of what one side of the aisle was claiming the mango was going to deliver on.  Volume tapered off to normal levels since then, but has since started picking up on the upbeat news that should have effect on this particular industry.

&#x200B;

Outlook:  I'm incredibly bullish on $NCLH.  I'm highly bullish on $CCL.  $RCL is a little more problematic to me, looking at the total picture, and I'm pretty neutral on them overall, bordering on skeptical.

I had more I wanted to talk about, but I'm tired of typing.

&#x200B;

# So, To summarize:

&#x200B;

* Your Boomer parents are going to start getting on these boats again as soon as they start floating
* Unlike last time (and thanks to the K-shaped recovery), they'll very likely splurge on the shore activity packages rather than cheap out and sit by the pool at every port this time since they have extra money to burn
* None of these companies are facing imminent financial threat, and have not only secured solid credit lines and nice reserves to weather this storm without sinking  (get it?  Hah), but actually showed their financial houses were pretty tight
* They've always been reliable earners, and will continue to be as they ramp back up.  This is a rare opportunity to get what is usually a slow moving Boomer stonk at a steep discount
* In the future, they'll actually be able to make MORE money because they had COVID as an excuse to suspend dividends, and don't think for a second they're going to be in a rush to bring those back even after shit returns to normal
* Your grandparents still don't love you either
* Buy a cruise ticket and you'll be sad, but you'll have enough money to where you'll be able to find some 45 year old who's a bit on the brown side of ripe that mistakenly thought they were going to be Stella and get their groove back with some strapping Jamaican native, who nonetheless will be impressed by your stack of tendies and will probably still give you blowies as you try to reach down to get to the base of her sagging tiddies
* Also invest in some pharma plays for the inevitable increase in senior citizen STD's that's going to occur when they can leave the nursing homes again.  Your widowed grandparents are going to bang at least 6 complete strangers on lobster night because they heard it was an aphrodisiac.

# Price targets:

$NCLH:  Probably $46 by 2022.  $60 by 2023

$CCL and $CUK:  $35 by 2022.  $47 by 2023.  For $CUK subtract 5 bucks

$RCL:  $90 by 2022.  $96 by 2023

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?

Well, retard, one thing you definitely don't do is play short term FD's on this.  Sorry, I know how much you love them, but have you considered shorting $RIOT if you hate money?  You'll get the same effect, but you can at least say you lost money on digital fake money, which will make you rare.  The answer here is OTM leaps.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  If you ain't got cruise stonks, you ain't black

# Position disclaimers:

&#x200B;

$CCL:  700 1/22 $25c's.  I'll likely expand this position to 1000 options

$NCLH:  2000 1/23 $42.5c's.  I'll very likely add another 3000 2023 calls if there's some terrible news that causes a precipitous drop

Edit 1:  of course I posted this right as Reddit shit the bed.  Had to fix some images.  Hopefully.

Edit 2:  My NCLH is 2023, not 2022.

&#x200B;

Edit 3:  $CCL just announced after the bell today (2/22) that they're issuing a billion dollars in shares again in a further dilution.  This is a surprise, as they don't have to do that given their cash on hand, and is undoubtedly looking to capitalize on the gains they've realized the last few months.  Obviously, such a level of dilution changes the thesis of $CCL a bit, and also creates uncertainty in the market for the other cruisers in whether they'll follow suit.  I don't have an updated math for this, but take it into account.",2021-02-19,119,43

April is going to be the true test I think for these operators, as that is when they are scheduled to sail again. Praying for more vaccines to be available, not just for the industry but for the world..... but mostly the industry.

I think NCLH does have the potential to get to $26.50 by option expire, given the run up this week. With that being said the YTD high has been $26.96 so we will see. One bad article out COVID and it will drop again.

I also raised my RCL price up $1.50. The stock has simply been on fire and a strike of $64.50 wouldn't have been much premium to collect.

# Trade 1: $QCOM long +$199.96

Trade thesis: Big gap up into all time highs, blue sky break out. Noticed a bit of pre-market weakness, looking to buy up a dip on a decent setup.

Trade execution:  Out of the gate we get a nice clean dump with no consolidation. I'm scouting a trend change. Nice tailing doji to mark a bottom on the 1m, then consolidation below VWAP. I'm looking for first 1m/5m candle to make new high and break above VWAP. I get just that, and go long w/ a half size position. I'm a bit hesitant with HOD looming above as resistance. I have SPY chart next to me and looks kinda choppy. I second guess myself and get too emotional and exit full, thinking to myself this was maybe a B+ setup as oppose to A+, and I can find something better.

Lessons/Takeaways: I should've let the trade prove or disprove itself rather than anticipate based on emotions. Had I held, we would've seen a break through HOD (potential add spot), with nice clean action to the upside. Would've easily been a $1000+ trade, but hindsight is 20/20. We're not robots and sometimes emotions get the best of us.

# Trade 2: $RCL short +$406.34

Trade thesis: 15% multi-day bounce coming into three SMA resistances (20, 100, 200 day). Looking at daily chart, we see each previous break above 200D results in a breakdown below it again, potentially making buyers gun shy to do so again. I see bulls broke through 100D resistance, but since then have just been slowly grinding towards 200D resistance while SPY rips up, indicating lack of bullish enthusiasm. Began scouting short entry below 200D SMA.

Trade execution: Took a couple starters in the green zone (see 1m chart below) and cut the position when it didn't break down for small >$100 loser and winner respectively. Saw price pop up and that 1m candle to $59.75 with a topping tail, began scouting another entry. Took a half size with loss of 1m up trend and added to full size as we lost 5m up trend.  Stop level a few pennies above 200D SMA. We broke below VWAP, but 100D SMA proved to be support, and when we broke above $59 and VWAP, I exited full. Normally I like to scale out and use trailing stops on the last portion of my position, but I was hoping to see a 1m bear flag as oppose to a bounce right back above key levels, which gives bulls quite a bit of confidence.

Lessons/Takeaways: My entry was a bit aggressive, but it was nice to get quick confirmation and a clear add spot. SPY was also showing weakness so that gave me a buffer of confidence as well. I'm glad with my execution overall though, especially the exit. Had I placed a trailing stop hoping for price to break back below key support, I would not have made as much.

Florida has no state income tax and needs cruises to restart with gov't aid ending.  Their governor wants the ports reopened.  60% of US cruises leave from Florida and the state is home to the three busiest cruise ports in the world.

Given that it was only a one month extension (to where the cruise lines voluntarily pushed it anyway) it is reasonable to assume that cruises will be given a chance to restart come November.  If they can actually get people out and back without killing dozens (big if), the cruise stocks will moon.

You can argue that people won't go back to cruises, but I'd say well then you've clearly never met cruise people.  Over 50% of passengers on cancelled cruises took credits vs. refunds.  A 3000 passenger ship would be full next week if it could sail.  Cruises were the fastest growing luxury travel segment precovid.

My Positions: shares of all three, selling puts and covered calls to collect premium.  Not a big fan of long calls since who knows when they'll actually break 30 (or 90) again.

iydm77_RCL,RCL,Why I think CCL/RCL/NCLH will PRINT,"The No Sail Order will expire 9/30. The industry is doing everything it can to not have this extended. Market believes CDC will extend this at least until EOY. In any case, we should hear a decision within the week. The upside and downside potential of a decision warrants a two way bet on their weeklies.

Personally, I think CDC will let the order expire given the new industry health guidelines, but I am betting in both directions.

- The business model is solid af
- ships do not sail unless 100% occupancy is reached
- primary audiences are wealthy boomers who watch Tucker Carlson and couldn‚Äôt give two mexiCAN pubic hairs of a fuck about Rona, which they consider a made up government tool in the first place from watching too much conservative Fox News.
- subscription rates, customer retention, and demand outlook are all high af.
- they all got enough cash to ride out like 18+ months of nothing activity
- cancel rate is not only extremely low, they‚Äôve guaranteed themselves higher purchase values per customer with their tricky discounts

gignio_RCL,RCL,"Two big earnings plays for maximum tendies, RCL and PLT","#Wow this looks like a lot of words, why should I bother?

Last week I introduced you guys to [SDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/), a stock that profited call holders upwards of 500%. The week before I told you about my [MTCH play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/) which was an easy and predictable win. Even before that, I've made good calls on earning plays throughout Q1 (snap calls, twtr puts, etc). With a pretty decent track record, I wanted to discuess what I think are my next big movers (in the uppies direction) for earnings next week. 

#Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)

The first is [RCL, they're releasing earnings 8am on May 20th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/rcl). Now why would I bother with a cruise line?.. Well all know the coronavirus pandemic has hammered the cruise industry, which shuttered operations in mid-March after a series of outbreaks at sea. The thing is, investors will be looking for any signs of life as the economy starts opening back up. They‚Äôll be trading for future value, not the fact that the company has made no money recently. Consider all the people who haven't been out in MONTHS that are now [itching to fucking get on a cruise](https://www.tmz.com/2020/05/09/carnival-bookings-spike-increase-cruises-resuming-august/). If you're not interested in this one because you think it's a risky play, just skip over to the PLT DD I've written down below. The thing is, shares have good support at the $37 price level since its lows post-covid. Sailings are supposed to [resume June 12 with CDC approval.](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/itinerary-updates). 

In addition to this, there were [talks of bond offerings back in April](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/royal-caribbean-in-talks-for-more-financing-to-ride-out-shutdown?sref=DWzi38c2) with no subsequent announcement, so that‚Äôs good. The potential for this offering would provide for an easy pop in price. Also, [they've been put on a debt holiday granted by Germany](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/snubbed-in-u-s-rescue-cruise-lines-get-relief-from-germany). For those who don't know, this 12-month debt holiday is meant to provide hundreds of millions in additional liquidity between now and April 2021. With liquidity being tight, [operating expenses have overall been reduced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/royal-caribbean-group-provides-business-update-301055738.html) and will most likely stay reduced for the most part as this will result in a faster 'bounce-back' and higher profits for the future. [If all of that wasn't enough, they've even patented a covid19 face mask for cruise ship purposes only, and we all know they're gonna sell fucking *millions* of those](https://thepointsguy.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruise-seaface-mask/).

The stock is up over the last month but is down over the last 7 days, making it a prime candidate to ride up towards earnings as its share price was over $41 just days ago. Any positive market news unrelated to the industry the stock should follow with some gains as well. It's important to know that they‚Äôve been through the worst of it already. All the numbers are known. They aren‚Äôt at risk of going under right now. They have enough liquidity to weather the rest of the year without needing to issue debt. Reminder, this is not a long term play. It‚Äôs an earnings play. And for that reason I'm eyeing the 5/22 exp. $38. Premiums are high with ATM contracts, so you can go for OTM too. 

#Plantronics Inc. (PLT)

Okay, so PLT needs an actual intro. Plantronics is an American electronics company producing audio communications equipment for business and consumers. Its products support unified communications, mobile use, gaming and music. [Their earnings is on May 21, 4:05pm.](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/plt). This company is is similar to [HEAR](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hear) a stock that rose from $6 to $11.50 in anticipation for earnings, was overbought and then had some pullback afterwards. Also note the rise that [LOGI is enjoying right now and has been for the last week](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi). This is why I'm telling you about these earning plays in advance, so we can play on the run-up, rather than buy high IV contracts the day before earnings and have the potential to lose our money. Regardless, [here's some juicy numbers on why I think they'll beat earnings.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/poly-provides-business-update-301040748.html). The tl;dr is that they've raised guidance to the top end of guidance from the previous earnings release and could possibly blow past that. In addition to this they suspended their quarterly dividend which shows some good faith when it comes to maintaining their liquidity (and saves them $25m/yr) and deferred any debt repayments until Q1 2021 (comes from their 8-K filed on 4/15). [The current consensus on the target price for PLT shares between all analysts is $18.00 per share](https://dbtnews.com/2020/05/11/plantronics-inc-plt-is-currently-13-06-below-its-200-period-moving-avg-what-dose-this-mean/) as of May 11th. 

There were some supply chain disruptions (facility shutdowns) in Mexico due to covid19 that were supposed to be closed 4/14 through 4/30, so they should be back online now. As of right now they have $226m in liquidity so no risks of financial trouble at the moment. All in all, a good solid earnings about to come from them and should see a nice run up to earnings and even maybe a pop the day after. $15c 6/19 is the recommended play. Because June 19th is pretty far away these contracts have a sweet delta and low theta those of us who are getting in early enough before IV crush kills our play.

**tldr:** Covid19 is clearing up for cruise stocks, RCL would be a good buy right now as their fundamentals are solid. As for PLT, it will go up before earnings similarly to HEAR and LOGI.

frd5yt_RCL,RCL,NCLH vs RCL- the better investment?," Now I‚Äôm aware that the cruising companies may not get bailed out, but I‚Äôm still bullish about them and feel that there‚Äôs a potential for 3x the return (if you have a long term position).

I usually like investing in the top players of the industry but the reason I‚Äôve ruled out CCL is because of the virus outbreak in CCL‚Äôs Diamond Princess.

So I‚Äôve narrowed my options to RCL and NCLH and I‚Äôm going to invest in only one of them. Obviously the biggest determiner will be if the companies can survive as business operations are at a halt and how fast they‚Äôre burning through their money. I feel the prices might go down even further in the next couple of weeks given that covid-19 still on the rise. Strategy is going to be basically buying in small increments on the way up.

f55xs3_CCL,CCL,Analysis on RCL,"I'm Singaporean and after the cruise ship stuff that happened in Asia, I figured cruise lines would be taking a hit rn.

I believe the fear of the coronavirus has more or less reached its peak. China takes the biggest chunk of cases while globally it hasn't been that big of a deal. The cruise lines have fallen about 15% from their peaks.

Royal Caribbean is a popular option for cruises in the Asian region, based on internet searches with a decent market in China.

I believe we will definitely recover beyond the current price but I also think that it's possible that it continues to fall a bit more after Q1 reports turn out disappointing.

A lot of people assume that demand will surge after the virus blows over as people proceed with previously planned purchases. However, cruises are entertainment which will likely to be cut when you realise that the Chinese people have already took massive hits to their income for the year with almost 1+ months of lockdown. People will simply not want to spend as much on wants after the hit to income which will likely continue.

I'm gonna get into RCL but I can't quite figure out now or wait for Q1 reports.",2020-02-17,0,6
