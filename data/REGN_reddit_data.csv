For those unaware, CRISPR is a programmable gene editing system discovered in 2012 which allows precise gene editing at a target locus. Jennifer Doudna, the founder of NTLA, and Emannuelle Charpentier, the founder of CRSP, were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

This really demonstrates the promise of CRISPR to treat all genetic diseases. 

I believe this will cause the entire sector of gene editing and maybe genomics stocks to move higher. Other stocks in this field include BEAM, EDIT, VERV, VRTX, and CRSP.

nssm3e_REGN,REGN,REGENERON received FDA clearancefor reduced dosage for COVID-19 treatment," 

Hello all,

I am long Regeneron, gave 10 shares @ 497$. Not financial advise. I saw this yesterday and didn't see it discussed, yet.

TLDR: REGENERON received on June 4th the FDA [clearance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW52aXouY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANXXYbaNF8GZL6R6VNc7SFVXmzJXO412QBHXD3v1yXpw-CIsX2AhhbI1FTBY5px_IGMYIh8Pk0SXz8otJFyLmn53RKVUdShJbWzzvebEIeM5LHhV5aEcXMS_RzRN9qqgf91Ojrid7RfQgsv7_hElWuYhfT44Y-uCX_cxSMwFVahB)  to use 1200 mg instead of 2400 mg. it seems this news might boost  income by 13% (assuming that there are little extra cost to implement)  based on the guaranteed US deal until June 30 alone.

I think the timing of this (early June) will impact the stock very positively according to this [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-authorizes-lower-1-200-110000685.html):

>The  U.S. government will purchase all REGEN-COV doses delivered by June 30,  2021 and may accept additional doses through September 30, 2021 at its  discretion, up to a maximum amount of 1.25 million doses.

Considering  that one former dose is now effectively 2 doses, they will earn double  for basically no extra cost (except packaging and shipping, or maybe  just relabeling the vials, I guess) for doses to be delivered in June.  Depending on how fast this is possible to implement, of course... For  the potential doses until September, I would expect them to have half  the production cost accordingly.

According to this [barron's article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fda-authorizes-lower-regeneron-covid-19-antibody-dose-that-opens-the-door-to-bigger-sales-51622819267?siteid=yhoof2),

>The lower-dose level would allow it to deliver more doses and could increase the amount of the possible payout, [for a total of up to $2.6 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)  
\[...\]  
Regeneron  now says it expects to deliver at least 1 million doses to the  U.S.  government in the second quarter of the year, depending on   manufacturing operations. At the $2,100 per-dose level implied by the   information Regeneron has provided about its contract, the U.S.   government would pay $2.1 billion for those 1 million doses.

More [specifically](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-inks-deal-to-sell-covid-19-treatment-to-u-s-even-as-usage-lags-51610545649?mod=article_inline)

>Under   the new deal, the government will purchase up to 1.25 million doses   delivered by June 30. Hitting that benchmark would be contingent on   Regeneron being authorized to sell the cocktail at a smaller dosage   level than is currently authorized; at the current dosage level, the   company will deliver 750,000 doses by June 30.  
The  company said  that the government would pay $2.625 billion if all 1.25  million doses  are delivered, implying a price of $2,100 per dose. That  is well over  the implied price of $1,500 per treatment course the  company charged in  its first agreement with the government.

So,  from past delivery estimates of 750 k doses to 1 M doses by June 30  would be additional revenue of 250 k \* 2,100 $ = 525 M $ at presumably  little production cost for Regeneron.  According to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=REGN), past sales of 9.2 B $ and income of 4 B $ that would be 5.7% increased sales or 13.1% additional income.

That  is not taking the potential 250 k additional doses that the US might  accept between until and Sept 30. And not taking the European [deal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-secures-55-000-doses-100715709.html) for 55 k doses (if EMA approved) or the Swiss extra 3 k doses into account.

They have been working closely on a treatment for brain cancer, GBM, together. The market for GBM treatment globally is around $400 million with current treatments essentially palliative in nature \[2,3\].

Regeneron ($RGN) is rumored to be buying out Inovio ($INO) at around $30 a share. Look for news on Bloomberg terminal and ([https://www.prnewswire.com/](https://www.prnewswire.com/)) in the next 7 days. With Inovio currently around \~$6.5 this would equate to 500% gain on common share and of course much more on call options. This stock is also heavily shorted by Citadel et al. Upward movement on $INO would cause them to cover their short positions which would potentially act as a catalyst for $GME.

m2qu0m_REGN,REGN,Why does REGN Trade at 15 P/E?,"Can someone explain to me why REGN continues to go down or in general their market cap seems uncorrelated with their revenues/profits?

Their revenues have grown 16% on average over the last 5 years and have monotonically grown over the last 10 years (I.e. their revenues grow every year). Their EBT is 27-40% which on either end of the interval is quite good. They only trade at 15 P/E where plenty of drug manufactures like JNJ trade at 30.  They have not been diluting shares, their forward looking projections are optimistic, and they are well below analyst price projections (although I don't care too much for that).

They have 9 approved drugs and 8 in phase 3. I assume most won't make it from phase III to being FDA Approved but they appear as through they will be able to get something.  Are all bio stocks just hype machines?  


Overall, I am miffed by the evaluation here but I think it's because I don't know much about pharmaceuticals.

lrfm9g_REGN,REGN,Time for REGN?,"Today, I added to my Regeneron (REGN) position. Although REGN has been dropping the last few weeks, there is a lot to like about this stock. My price target (pt) is 700, a 50% increase from here and giving it up to a year to get there, although I expect it will get to it much faster.

REGN has a PE around 15, beat earnings the last 3 quarters and has steadily raised earnings outlook. It has a strong balance sheet and has received FDA approval for several drugs recently. Earlier this month, Cathy Woods bought 100,000shares for her ARK fund. There are currently no sells on REGN. Short interest is less than 3% and institutional shareholder ownership is 92%.

Everything about REGN looks good except for the recent price drop. I attribute it not to any problems with REGN, but to the fact that institutions were chasing alpha in other market sectors. So, to me, this  
 one is a layup.

If all this sounds compelling, I suggest you do your own homework and decide if there is a place in your portfolio for REGN. Let me know in the comments whether you agree or disagree.",2021-02-24,6,2

The two companies I was thinking about are $LLY and $REGN

According to Christian Drosten (German virologist/ ""Dr. Fauci of Germany""), the spread of the virus will continue to increase over the next year. Restrictions will be lifted after the risk groups have gotten the vaccine. Meaning, in the short-run (1-2y), the vaccine will not make COVID treatments obsolete and the need for treatments will still be there. Antibody treatments are the most promising candidates for effective treatment so far.

‚ÄúThe FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.

The FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.

This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

The FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease
The treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.

Regeneron's REGEN-COV2 'antibody cocktail' - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus' spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells.

Regeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.

WHAT IS REGENERON'S ANTIBODY COCKTAIL?

Regeneron's drug 'cocktail,' REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company from mice and another isolated from a recovered COVID-19 patient, each of which may help to neutralize coronavirus. 

The firm's latest data from the ongoing trials, show the drug drove down the viral loads of patients who were not hospitalized and cut their recovery times by nearly half. 

But it's very much an experimental treatment, and the data announced earlier this week are the first published from the trial. 

Two patients treated with the antibody cocktail had 'adverse events' - undesirable side effects. One of those was a 'serious' adverse event, but Regeneron did not reveal details of what happened to the patient, who received a low dose of the drug. 

REGN-COV2 is comprised of a duo of therapeutics in a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies (hence REGN-COV2's distinction as a 'polyclonal antibody'), which are clones of antibody that attacks a specific antigen.

The company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.

The FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.

Trump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments, including an antibody therapy from Regeneron.

Monoclonal antibodies treatments are also being developed by Eli Lilly and other companies.

The drugs mimic antibodies that the immune system naturally produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens.

Trump later credited the experimental drug therapy with aiding his recovery.

Trump returned to the White House on Monday October 5 after spending three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Maryland for coronavirus.

The monoclonal antibody cocktail is considered experimental because clinical trials are ongoing and it hasn‚Äôt been approved for the market by the FDA.

Trump was able to receive it through the FDA‚Äôs 'compassionate use' provision, where unapproved drugs are administered to seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options.

While Regeneron has shared promising results of the treatment, which cut the viral load of COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, there is no evidence the drug cut the risk of death or 'cured' patients.

There also is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect.

Last month, Bill Gates said Trump was wrong to call monoclonal antibodies treatment a 'cure' for COVID-19, but says it‚Äôs the most promising therapeutic in research for now.

'The word ""cure"" is inappropriate because it won't work for everyone. But of all the therapeutics, this is the most promising,' the Microsoft founder said on the October 11 broadcast of NBC‚Äôs Meet The Press.‚Äù",2020-11-22,39,15

8u6sqc_REGN,REGN,Stocks people hate for no reason: REGN,"Regeneron ($REGN) is a biotech company that delivers and delivers and delivers. Their pipeline is pumping out blockbuster drugs like hotcakes. They have very little debt and make a fuckton of money. So naturally it's eating shit near 5 year lows and down to $320 off it's ATH of $580. So why will it go back up?

First of all, REGN makes a best-in-class drug for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) called Eylea. And we all know $AMD has gone up 40% in the last month, which is clearly related. They're going to be selling this shit in China soon, which means lots more squinty eyes to treat, and more revenue. I know the C-word has been scaring a lot of you lately, but this is still a big opportunity. Don't fucking wait. 

Second, they just made a dope-ass eczema drug. Eczema is a shitty allergic condition where your skin is red and dry and itchy all the time. I have it, so I can confirm it sucks donkey cock. REGN just released a drug called Dupixent, which takes a steaming dump on eczema until your skin is as smooth as a baby's ass. Drug sales sucked last quarter, but they're still in ramp phase and 90% of people refill their prescriptions. Oh, by the way, this shit costs $30k/year. They just finished their clinical trials for adolescents, who make up more than 25% of eczema sufferers. Expect this fucker to ramp. 

Third, y'all ever hear of something called the allergic triad? It's when people with eczema also have allergies and asthma. Your body is a piece of shit that is allergic to literally everything. Remember that eczema drug we talked about? Turns out it shits on those related conditions, and it's going through clinical trials for asthma, food allergies, and nasal polyps. That means more revenue and some protection against competitors in the eczema space. 

Still not good enough for you? Our nigga Shkreli owns it:   https://youtu.be/X-XFxDANS6U?t=838

Now a couple of bad points:

- Most of their money comes from AMD, and drug competition is getting tighter. Theirs is still the best, but w/e.

- Wall Street hates this stock. CEO is more interested in making drugs than placating analysts. Good or bad depending on how you see it. 

- $320/share is a lot for you poor autists.

Buy shares or LEAPS; who knows when the run-up will happen. I'm in for about $19,000. Because the stock has dropped so much, there's not much downside risk, aside from Eylea sales eating shit next Q. Even during last week's market bed-shitting, it only dropped 1-2%. It has more sales and better prospects than last year, but is trading at a 37% discount. So yeah, buy it. ",2018-06-27,17,27
8g09ok_REGN,REGN,Buy $REGN FDs before close today and sell by May 2nd before their earnings report.

My strike price may change depending on where the price is at near closing bell. 

$REGN has been so depressed lately that this play is most likely going to lose money. But I'm banking on a sudden shift in perception before earnings since the stock is at a 2-year low. I either expect share price to hold around $300/share today, or drop to near $290 end of day today, which is when I'll double down on my position. 

I only need share price to go back up to $310/share the day before earnings for a nice profit. I'm selling the moment I hit more than a 50% profit. I'm not going to hold through to earnings *unless* I lose more than 50%. If I lose 50% or more of my initial position, I'm just going to say fuck it and hold through earnings hoping for a miracle. 

$REGN has been in dire straits for good reason, so its recent fall from grace isn't due to nothing. I like betting on companies with large amounts of negativity surrounding them because I think I'm smarter than everyone else.",2018-04-30,6,6
