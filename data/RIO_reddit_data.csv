1hte6xi_PATH,PATH,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal,"Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), as announced by the company on Monday.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",2025-01-04,8,3

1gwktsg_RIO,RIO,UUUU: The next Rio Tinto (RIO),"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 80+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 150 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value ~$80/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the high 80s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take ~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale.

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that (edit: I can now, Radium-226 goes for 10 million USD/gram, if UUUU can even make a pound of that its 500million in revenue and they're aiming to go to commercial levels after 2026 and starting small in 2025) but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company currently has 140 million in liquidity, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly really lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be ~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen's (NXE) Arrow deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO) or close to it, specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto which trades at a 110Billion market cap. If UUUU even becomes worth 20% of that which I think is a fair assessment given the above points (I didn't even get into vanadium mineralization) that would be ~120 a share based on the current float. This is a very conservative estimate based on current mineral values, not what the minerals will be worth in 5+ years. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 80/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 150+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone and their wives' boyfriends saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining U stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium.

FWIW, I am not so bullish on the US mining/steel companies - China is dumping cheap steel and unlike furnished products, it is hard for anyone to tell if the steel is from Mexico (China's backdoor) and China so the tariffs may not work as well as expected. ",2024-09-02,10,13

FERC lifts remand on Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG, allowing projects to move forward after nearly 20 months of delays, thus Biden administration gives go-ahead to Texas LNG export projects.

Analysts say FERC's approval could give NextDecade (NEXT) the momentum it needs to reach a final investment decision for Rio Grande LNG, which has reached sales and purchase agreements for 10.75M metric tons of its anticipated 27 tons/year of liquefied natural gas.

According to POTEN NextDecade LNG is in talks with TotalEnergies to sign a 4 mmpta SPA deal with equity to finance the LNG facility in Texas in June.

What caught my eye was that EMR signed a $22.5M JV deal on New York Canyon Project in Nevada with Rio Tinto's ($RIO) subsidiary, Kennecot Exploration. 

* New York Canyon Project: Advanced-stage exploration property with a database including 234 drill holes drilled totalling 42,400 meters and host to three known copper exploration targets
* Kennecott is able to earn a 75% interest in the project by completing US$22.5 million in exploration expenditures

qsgyhm_BHP,BHP,Rio Tinto Idea (10%+ div yield) and stock down 16% YTD | $100bn mkt cap biz,"# Rio Tinto DD

Ticker: RIO. Listed in ASX, London and US ADR. I'll be referring to the performance of the London listed shares.

Market cap: $101bn

Position: Long only holder across savings account and leveraged accounts.

Sources used: Google Finance, Bloomberg, Rio Capital Markets day presentation from October 2021 (latter very useful!)

# Summary of idea

* Stock is down \~16.5% to 12 November 2021 and is down around 5.5% in total return terms YTD
* This compares to Metals & Mining ETF (Ticker: XME) which is +40% YTD
* EV/EBITDA multiple around 3.7x
* Rio has a double digit dividend yield indicated for 2022 based on analyst estimates (10+%)
* Stock has sold off on plunging Iron Ore prices (linked to slowdown in China Property sector)
* Company has a very strong balance sheet (had a net cash position of $3.14bn) which means it has option (carry out M&A into more “green transition metals” and pay dividends to shareholders).
* Reason for holding / adding: Pick up the attractive dividend yield in lieu of a more normalization of Iron ore demand but also potentially more attractive returns from its other metal divisions (aluminum/copper/lithium).

#  About Rio Tinto

* Rio Tinto Group is an Anglo-Australian multinational and the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation, behind BHP.
* Rio market cap = $101bn
* BHP market cap = $136bn
* Note that Rio’s top shareholder is a Singapore based entity owned by Chinalco (Aluminum corporation of China). Their shareholding has remained quite significant since their shares have not been bought back in most recent share buybacks

# Valuation

Rio trades around an EV/EBITDA multiple of around 3.7x, which doesn’t seem very demanding.

# Key strengths of the stock

a) **High dividend yield and high likelihood of payment -** Management are very likely to keep dividend in tact (\~10-11% yield estimates) as it forms a key part of their strategy.

**b)** **Rio has a solid balance sheet –** Namely, it was in a net cash position as at H1 2021, it has a Single A Credit rating (therefore has ample access to cheap financing if needed). Their balance sheet is in much better shape than when the commodities crash happened in 2015/16. No bond maturities until 2024 and didn’t draw down on bank facility during pandemic. Rio recently tendered for its 2025 bonds (buyback) in order to increase its debt maturity profile.

**c)**  **Mega cap – Liquid shares on FTSE 100 and also US ADR and ASX listed shares.**

**d)** **Several equity analysts covering the stock have already reduced their estimates in light of lowered company Iron Ore production guidance.**  Some analysts reduced their earnings estimates post the capital markets day in October. Although they might not have adjusted fully for the more recent large drop in Iron ore prices.

#  Opportunities for stock to re-rate

* US Infrastructure bill and global infrastructure programs (in order to boost GDP post COVID)
* The End of Chinese Winter Olympics (Q1 2022)  - Since for now, China has asked steel mills to cut production until March 15 2022, in order to clear the smog-blanketed sky and to ensure the achievement of the country's steel output reduction target.
* Business is future-proofing itself to be more ESG compliant and held a recent capital markets day mainly for this aspect.
* CEO is actively exploring growth options in copper, lithium and other ‘transition metals’ in change from predecessor
* Availability of cash and ample funding lines means they can execute on M&A plans into higher growth areas (see opportunities)
* Iron ore prices – Low prices unlikely to last forever. Think back to how post the pandemic, low price barrels were hoovered up eventually by Chinese State and others.
* Rio is looking to grow some of its non Iron-ore Metals franchises significantly between 2020 and 2030:

1. Lithium – By 10x
2. Nickel – By 5.5x
3. Cobalt – By 3.85x
4. Copper – By 1.5x

* Other areas they are involved in include Green Aluminum and Green Steel
*  RIO committed $2.4 bn to the Jadar lithium borates project in Serbia, one of the world’s largest greenfield lithium project. Jadar will produce battery-grade lithium carbonate and position RIO as the largest source of lithium supply in Europe for at least the next 15 years. In addition, Jadar will produce borates, which are used in solar panels and wind turbines.  

**Threats and Weaknesses**

* Short-medium term Iron ore demand picture due to China appears pretty abysmal:
* In October - Iron ore stockpiles at major Chinese ports rose to their highest since the pandemic impacted China’s economy in March 2019. Total stocks rose to 142.3 million metric tons by the end of October, as the slowdown in major steel mills output continued. Bloomberg
* Demand in other parts of Asia also weak currently - In the period from October 1 to 22, Japan and South Korean inbound iron ore shipments declined by more than 40% compared to the comparable four-week period in September. Four-week rolling averages for the two countries are now at the lowest levels compared to the same period in past years. Singapore shipments declined by around 6%, but remain in line with seasonal average levels. Bloomberg
* China’s steel industry continues to reel from supply curbs. Steel industry output fell 7.4% month-on-month in October, according to the China Iron & Steel Industry Association. Meanwhile, basic oxygen furnace steel mill utilization rates fell below 75% in the final two weeks of October. Source: Bloomberg
* Rising unit costs (higher processing costs, haulage, energy, and wage costs)
* Higher energy costs stay high for longer, which reduces margins

Hello guys,

China has been slapping the alarm now. Some may know that between the 2000s and 2012 or so China was boosting commodity prices to build itself, then suddenly they stopped. The issue there was, miners were overspending on the huge demand - they could never satisfy it, they wanted to get ahead of demand. Check out Vale’s cashflow statement for 2011 (peak), they got 23.4b cash and spent 15.8b on CAPEX, while 2012 they got 16.1b cash and spent 15.3b CAPEX. They clearly overspent there, no space to reward shareholders, oversupplying the market when China suddenly stopped.

Today, these miners have not been spending much on CAPEX (max maintenance), and opening new mines take years (environmental studies, exploration, government okay papers), some opened closed mines or finished already started projects (or trying to finish). Supply is not that abundant.

Today China wants to cut emissions. They cut steel production - that’s the steel thesis. 

VALE 67% fe pure high quality and pellets are the greenest you get from iron ores, needs water and wet production.

BHP and RIO have lower quality 58-62% and dry produced. Also Australia has worse relations with China than Brazil.

My VALE thesis comes from here, China will not cut back from Vale since it’s the greenest option ( Vale Q1 to Q2 27,7% iron pellet increased production). Vale still has room to grow its production and has other metals which is trending for long time to come (nickel).

When steel prices are this elevated and they might go higher, China would really want to get on the action and start producing which could boost iron ore consumption, hopefully the green quality one.

Share your thoughts please about this.",2021-08-13,9,0

Perhaps that is why Goldman Sachs analysts raised the price target to a level 69% higher than the stock is trading presently (close around $86 yesterday new price target is $148).    
If it takes 16 years from signing the contract to produce lithium to production on average, what will prices for lithium be when Rio Timto starts selling from the project?  Is EV demand going to stand still?  If an EV car requires six times the minerals of a current car I think you can say lithium production is a growth industry 6 times the EV industry.

Here is will mock Wall Street price targets.  Rio Tinto has a Price to Earnings Multiple of 14 while Tesla has a PE of 382.  So Rio Tinto in the clean energy growth arena deserves a stock price 27 times higher than what it has now (382/14).  86 x 27 = $2,322 price for Rio Tinto.  But Rio Tinto's growth potential is 6 times Musk's production if it takes 6 times the minerals to make his car.  $2,322 x 6 = $13,932.  So I'm going to set my price target on Rio Tinto at $13,932 a share.",2021-07-29,5,11

**COPPER**

[https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/](https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/)

Copper prices rose on 8th Feb as optimism around a US stimulus raised hopes of higher demand for metals and a recovery in the world’s biggest economy.

The copper price rose as much as 1.3% to $3.6745 ($8,100 a tonne) on the Comex market on Monday, with March delivery contracts back within shouting distance of multi-year highs hit early in January.

The metal has rallied nearly 90% since the depth of the pandemic in March.

Thinning inventories

The rise in copper prices is underpinned by thinning inventories that pointed to higher demand for the industrial metal.

“Inventories are still quite low on exchanges. That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,” Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)

In China, the world’s top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.

But this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.

Meanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).

In Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country’s Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).

Copper miners gain

Despite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world’s top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.

**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.

Copper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. 

Green initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate plan, and China’s target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. 

Although mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.

Take [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  

The big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.

[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)

Many thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.

**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines**

Global copper demand

As mentioned above, it’s not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.

In the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.

 Who would have thought Australia would deserve close scrutiny for investment? Not me... That is, until I visited Perth (on the opposite side of the continent to Sydney), in Western Australia. I visited in 2009, at the height of the great recession, and was immediately struck by the dynamic skyline. There were cranes everywhere; skyscrapers were being erected at an energetic pace. The population was cashed up and on the spend. Everywhere I went people were excitedly expounding on the virtues of “the minerals boom.” My interest was piqued.

I did some digging and found something very interesting, Australia's Fortescue Metals Group (ASX [FMG] American depository receipts [FSUMF] and [FSUGY] very profitable). This company looked like a sleeper to me, I had heard about BHP Biliton [BHP] and Rio Tinto [RIO], but I had no idea that this quiet company is the fourth largest producer of iron ore in the world...
